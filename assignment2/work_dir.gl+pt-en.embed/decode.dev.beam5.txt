( Arabic ) <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
( <unk> ) <unk> in a middle class .
My father was five years old when she lost his father , but when I was <unk> , he was already a business man .
If your children were children or girls , if their children were children or girls , they were going to go to school .
So I suppose I was <unk> .
My mother was 16 times .
In <unk> 16 , we &apos;re alive five .
You can imagine why I had to pass when I was a girl .
<unk> , she watched women being transported to the <unk> , or children being found a <unk> .
At that point , when I finished a high school , I wanted to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I put it into my education , but I &apos;ll get to university .
<unk> , in my country , there didn &apos;t have been <unk> to women in the <unk> , but even if I was in school school , I couldn &apos;t go .
As a result , my father <unk> America .
I watched in America .
A couple of my studies got my studies .
Whereas <unk> my education , Russia has <unk> my country .
You know , when I was going to end my <unk> , I would ask him what was happening to my family and my country .
<unk> months , and I had no news .
My family would take a <unk> field .
So instead I ended up the studies , <unk> my family .
I wanted to keep them safe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when you get the news , when you get the news , when it &apos;s still what you &apos;re in my country , would you get your heart .
I would take back back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t go , because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
It was <unk> in a university .
<unk> .
She had a good life .
My family was here .
They try to live with them .
So it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to <unk> my home .
So we put it into the field of <unk> .
And when I came to the field of <unk> <unk> , there was seven million and a half million <unk> . Seven million and a half and a half million <unk> .
<unk> , black , black women were women and children , and most men in the war or they were in their war , and they know ?
When he was the apple apple , when he was the apple apple , he <unk> with things that didn &apos;t get <unk> .
I watched a widow with five and eight kids sitting there , and he said , <unk> , without knowing what to do .
I watched a new woman who didn &apos;t have to go in , without studies , or income , and a place where to live .
You watched kids who have lost their parents , their <unk> and that with 10 or 12 years , they had to take it into their families , and try to protect their siblings , their mothers and children .
The situation was absolutely <unk> .
My heart is <unk> by my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
In that moment , it feels a impulse .
At that point , I felt , what I can do for these people ?
How can I <unk> ?
I &apos;m just one person , who can do for them ?
But at that point , I knew that education has become my life .
<unk> . It will take a position .
<unk> trust . It &apos;s a career .
He said to him in my family , holding my family to another country , so they were safe .
And at the time I knew that what he meant to provide my people was education and health and that was what we would have to get .
But they think it &apos;s easy ?
Yeah , because of that , women didn &apos;t have access to education .
Furthermore , after <unk> of Russia in Afghanistan , people had no longer yet .
It was very difficult to get and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot;
Somebody came from the United States .
Some people who stand up here .
<unk> in me ? It &apos;s supposed to not .
So what really needed was to win the confidence of this community .
How do I go to it ?
I went on , I &apos;ve been looking at and watched .
I &apos;ve done questions .
So finally , I found a man .
He had 80 years .
It was a <unk> .
I went to his tent in the <unk> and <unk> , &quot; &quot; I want to give you a teacher . &quot;
And I <unk> it , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , crazy , how do I think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; Finally , <unk> my <unk> and I started with a class in his <unk> , <unk> the voice .
In fact , a year ago , we had 25 schools around , 15,000 kids going to school , and it was incredible .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
Of course , we were going to do our work , forming teachers . They live in rights of women , human rights , democracy , democracy , democracy and laws .
One day , I was in office in <unk> , a day , I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I was
And suddenly , I found that all my personal family went on the rooms and threw the doors and <unk> doors , and suddenly I found that all of my personal family went , and he was , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot;
You &apos;re afraid . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know what your life is going to play .
But as a leader , you have to keep <unk> .
You have to keep the <unk> and show that .
So I &apos;ve asked , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And those people will <unk> it in the mass of my office .
So <unk> entering the offices .
He was nine , nine , nine .
These were the greatest men who can see never .
( Laughter ) People like a <unk> <unk> , black black , <unk> <unk> , and it grows mass in my office .
And I would like to sit and take a cup .
<unk> . Don &apos;t get tea .
And of course , the pitch voice was going to be a lot of fear , and I was really depressed .
But at the same time , <unk> <unk> .
And , of course , at the moment , you see as a moment ago , covered in my head by a black armband , and , of course , at the time , covered in my head .
The only thing I saw was the eyes .
<unk> : What do you do ?
You don &apos;t know how to <unk> <unk> <unk> women ?
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I went to the face and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s my girls . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s my girls .
You have some students , some students , and all the Koran , the holy book .
You know ? The Koran says that if he <unk> the holy book , women can be good wives and they can obey their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And at that moment , they were talking about it . ( Laughter ) At that moment , they were talking to me .
<unk> between them and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And you know , <unk> tea again and got a <unk> and <unk> .
So my personal personal <unk> of my office .
They were killed <unk> .
They didn &apos;t know why not <unk> .
They didn &apos;t know why I don &apos;t care about them .
In all of all , we all were <unk> .
So happy and of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) So of course , I &apos;ll be alive .
But also , as we follow it during the fall of the <unk> , when the <unk> had the power was another story .
<unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> girls , <unk> students would kill him .
With the <unk> <unk> , we went to the country and we open a school after another .
<unk> centers for women .
Open clinics without stop .
We worked with women and children .
<unk> about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> how many types you can imagine .
I was very happy . She was <unk> with the result of my work .
And one day , when I was going on with four educators and a <unk> seat , I walked back to the north of Kabul , suddenly a time , <unk> at the middle of the road .
With it back to the back , we pasted the road .
I &apos;m going to show my driver that was going on and <unk> : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing to see you . &quot; &quot; My name was the name of it , and he said , &quot; &quot; I can <unk> it . &quot;
What you want ? &quot; &quot; They said nothing and <unk> .
At that point , women will take it into the car .
I &apos;m very familiar and <unk> , &quot; &quot; This is the end .
So this time , they would kill everyone .
I had no doubt .
But yet , when the moment comes out , it &apos;s going to make it the rest of what you think and what you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
<unk> in your <unk> and you can follow so much .
So let me take me on one side of the car .
My leg <unk> and went out of the car .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; Where can I <unk> ? &quot; &quot; They know what they told me ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it goes .
Come every day from one place to another .
<unk> women , <unk> women and also gives it the chance to have a job .
<unk> . What about you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What about us ?
What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; <unk> and <unk> : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Okay .
That we know , the only one we can do , for the time in what I &apos;ve played , it &apos;s a weapon and kill .
We don &apos;t know more . &quot; &quot; And you know what it means .
Obviously , it was a compliment .
So I put it up and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to let them go . &quot; &quot; And I came up and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going back , and I said to the driver , and I said to the driver , &quot; &quot; and then only <unk> women .
We just had money to help them , to go to school , and nothing more .
When I arrived at the office , obviously all the educators <unk> .
It would take your home . Nobody was .
My mouth was the only one who was there , and I had no voice .
I was <unk> , sitting in my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What I &apos;m going to do ? &quot; &quot; So how I &apos;m going to solve this problem ?
Because it &apos;s called education in the north .
Hundreds of women said to <unk> .
So I was there sitting there , and suddenly , we &apos;re here talking about pulses , because at the moment , one of my wonderful <unk> <unk> would have a report .
( <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And I wrote it .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot;
It was the same thing that I would remember , I didn &apos;t believe it , and still asking me .
Okay , tell you it &apos;s going on .
It took all the story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for the next one , you go to them .
<unk> . &quot; &quot; And when two days later , I tried the same way , know what ? They weren &apos;t there , they were a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the same
So I stopped the car .
<unk> and I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay , <unk> me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said
So the sudden I took the mosque and to summarize , said , I was going to <unk> teachers .
Now , they &apos;re the best educators .
<unk> English , learning as being teachers , business computer are my <unk> .
All the areas we don &apos;t know , in the mountain zones , they come up with me . They go forward and go .
And they <unk> .
And ... ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That begins to change people .
When we <unk> people , they change and , in today , we need to work with equality .
You can &apos;t raise women and <unk> men from men , because men are the people who are going to get them more difficult to women .
( Laughter ) So we started <unk> , because they must be aware of the potential of women , to know how the potential of that potential have the men and that women can <unk> the same jobs they have .
So we form men across and I think profoundly deeply deeply , and so we form a lot of men .
I live in a country that I live in a country that was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was beautiful , beautiful , beautiful country .
<unk> all parts .
Women will take education , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — and we end up at a home .
Don &apos;t get the doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out of any security problems .
But we still want to keep Afghanistan before .
And I want to tell you the other part .
Now women &apos;s women work very , very hard .
<unk> . <unk> to be <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be <unk> , again .
<unk> to be <unk> and make business business .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people use all their potential and all this will happen .
I want to share with you for love for love , compassion , by trust and honesty .
If you have these things , you &apos;ll be successful .
We have a poet , <unk> <unk> .
He said , if you have compassion , and if you have love , you can take it to the world .
And we <unk> , we could .
And if we were able to Afghanistan , I &apos;m safe to 100 percent that anybody can do it in the world .
Thank you , very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Ten years ago I got a phone call that changed my life .
So I was <unk> at UCLA University at UCLA University , Los Angeles of heart image in heart research .
I called this called a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
One old <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I &apos;d like you to go to the zoo to get to the <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you if I could go to the zoo to look for a possible heart .
We were going to leave clear that the United States are either very fraught with <unk> <unk> and highly <unk> that take a wonderful way of their own animals .
But sometimes , we would take it to the medical community , especially to some trade pair , but sometimes it &apos;s going to get it to the medical community , but sometimes it &apos;s going to change the health .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we doctors that the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> was not <unk> . Here &apos;s this photo , <unk> the heart of a <unk> , and the doctors in which we gave 700 <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the doctors in which we took 700 <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and doctors in which we took his heart .
And this process , that &apos;s called <unk> in many of humans , it was <unk> , with the exception of that <unk> and that glue .
<unk> symptoms , diagnostics , diagnostics and treatment for my human patients , we have been able to understand that we are going to be able to change their own animals .
And when it turns out , in the same day going on board at UCLA Medical Center and <unk> <unk> .
And I started to see clearly one thing .
Basically , the doctors and the <unk> would kill themselves , basically the doctors and <unk> <unk> , the same doctors and <unk> <unk> , cancer tumors , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , even as psychiatric disorders , even as psychiatric disorder , even like depression , anxiety , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Well , I have to give you a <unk> .
Even though I &apos;ve studied long-term physiology and evolutionary biology during university — even I did my sophomore thesis on the <unk> of Darwin — to learn more about the significant features between the human disease and human is a touch of attention to me .
And I started to realize how he could be , with all of these <unk> , who never <unk> opinion to a <unk> or <unk> <unk> to have another point about one of my human patients ?
Did you hear a <unk> conference ?
And even more , why should we be <unk> ?
We &apos;ve all collected some biological connections between the animals and human beings .
We all know the medicines we prescribe , we take or we give our families in a animal .
But there &apos;s a big difference between giving the animal a drug or a human disease , and that animal develop by itself as a human heart disease or diabetes or cancer .
If maybe , part of the surprise comes from the growing world that our world makes between the urban and not urban .
You &apos;re going to talk about these kids , <unk> , which you think that la grows in the trees or the cheese comes from a plant .
The human hospitals today , there &apos;s a lot of other things that we &apos;re going to transform more and closer to the technology we have .
And this creates a <unk> gap between human patients that are there being treated and the animals that live in the oceans , in the <unk> and in jungles .
But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : &quot; But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : &quot; But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : &quot; But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : &quot; But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : &quot; But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : &quot; But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : &quot; But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : &quot; But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : &quot; But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason :
And the doctors and scientists were going to take care of our species , Homo sapiens , it &apos;s just one one more , and more likely not only one species more , and not particularly special than any other .
But in our underwear we don &apos;t end up .
It would be me as well when you hear the Mozart or I see in my <unk> <unk> photos .
I feel like that called the human <unk> , even <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a higher species , the part .
Well , but this <unk> is <unk> .
Now , when I look at a human patient , I always ask myself , who know the doctors of animals that I don &apos;t know ?
How could we take better to the human patient if we want to take better to the human patient if it &apos;s a human human patient ?
And here &apos;s some examples of the <unk> connections that led me this kind of <unk> .
It was heart heart disease .
In the year 2000 , the human <unk> , the <unk> of humans , the human <unk> in the year 2000 .
It was described in a parent that was the game that I lost the whole savings of the entire life on an departure from the altar of the altar .
But it turns out that this brand new diagnosis and it was the new human and the new human illness .
<unk> had had become <unk> , trying and even <unk> symptoms <unk> in animals , from the monkeys , to <unk> , from the 1950s .
How many human lives could have <unk> if this <unk> <unk> went to the door of the emergency doctor and <unk> ?
<unk> .
Some other human patients will kill themselves .
<unk> it is <unk> .
Some other animals also recognize themselves .
There are <unk> that <unk> <unk> and again to <unk> .
But the <unk> have very specific forms and <unk> , and even prevent the <unk> in the animals that get rid of it .
Wouldn &apos;t it be that knowledge is going to be this <unk> knowledge , the parents and the patients who are struggling with them ?
<unk> <unk> and psychosis <unk> .
Sometimes , as a little bit of giving birth to some women in depression , sometimes in high depression , and still in <unk> states .
They can decline by their own child , and in the extreme cases coming to the <unk> .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> know they know that when instead of a <unk> , a little bit after the age , it could decline its <unk> , and they &apos;ll be able to <unk> it , and in some cases , we would get to <unk> .
But <unk> <unk> is a treatment to address this <unk> <unk> syndrome that we can increase the oxytocin of <unk> .
Oxytocin is the hormone of <unk> , and it &apos;s that the <unk> has a gift in its <unk> .
Wouldn &apos;t it be that information from the <unk> and <unk> , of the family doctors and the patients who are faced with the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> ?
Despite the <unk> that &apos;s all this , the distance between our cultured is being large .
To <unk> , a lot of fear I &apos;m going to have to put to you to put some of it .
There are doctors who can be <unk> <unk> with the professionals that are not <unk> in medicine .
I mean , the Connecticut , <unk> and psychologists , but especially in the <unk> .
Of course , most of the doctors have no idea that it &apos;s more difficult to get in today a day in a <unk> <unk> than one of the medicine of a medicine , and that when you go to medicine learn everything that &apos;s relevant to know about a species , Homo sapiens , <unk> , fish , fish and birds .
So I don &apos;t blame the <unk> by <unk> <unk> with <unk> and ignorance of my coworkers .
So here &apos;s a punchline of part of the <unk> : How do you call a <unk> that you just know about treating a species ?
<unk> this gap became my passion , and I &apos;m making it through the programs like Darwin <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of the other doctors and residents of it and the <unk> of our fellow doctors <unk> our debt and residents .
And through the scenes , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of medicine and <unk> to get collaborative debates about the diseases and the disorders of the human and animals .
In the scenes , the participants were learning as the treatment of a cancer diagnosis in a <unk> , so you can help the better treat cancer for a master of infant education ; how to understand the <unk> <unk> of an <unk> cow , and how to understand the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , and how to understand the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , and how to understand the health of the conversation .
In the scenes of <unk> , first in America , and now around the world , doctors and <unk> will drop their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> as colleagues as the doctors .
So the end of all , humans are also animals , and it &apos;s also time that we are , and it &apos;s time that we are , and we have doctors , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of time that we would , and we &apos;re going to take them into one of the health care of the health that will spread all species .
Because it turns out that some of the best and more <unk> drugs are being found by doctors that have patients who are not human .
And one of the best ways to treat the human patient is going to make a lot of attention to how we all other patients of the planet of live , grow , <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) Here the key word is &quot; &quot; was . &quot;
( Applause ) Having <unk> brain was , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , that you can imagine , as you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , you can imagine , as you can imagine , you can
I didn &apos;t know anything about <unk> .
In cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , and in cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you know , in the middle cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , and in cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> ,
Life , the one of a complex human being , is replaced by medical data : your <unk> , the medical exams , the list of medicine ...
Suddenly it would take a disease with legs .
The doctors begin to talk about a language that you don &apos;t .
I &apos;ll ask you to make your body with your body and your body <unk> .
People starts to change also because it begins to treat disease instead of the person .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What do you hear the doctor ? &quot; &quot; even before he said , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; As much as saying &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; And as I said , &quot; &quot; Hello .
( Video ) <unk> of the guy , &quot; &quot; Am I to work with <unk> ?
Will I study ? Where do love love ? Are you creative ?
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What did I do to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; I can change something in my life style ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : There &apos;s something that can do to do it ?
There &apos;s some other option ? &quot; &quot; And of course , the doctors are the good guys in all these cases , because they &apos;re very unlikely and compromised with <unk> .
But it &apos;s also used to treat treating patients , so I would say that the time they were to the time they are the point of view that it &apos;s a torture and what you &apos;ll see , literally , in a patient .
( Laughter ) Things are changing , but the typical thing is that I &apos;m going to get rid of any way in knowing your situation , in knowing your family and friends or your friends , you &apos;ll take it into your family style to minimize the risks of what you &apos;re going to happen .
But with all , here , I &apos;m going to expect in my hands of a bunch of very professionals .
As I was in the hospital , I asked them to tell me my <unk> on my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I asked myself to <unk> my <unk> on my <unk> <unk> , I asked myself that my <unk> was in the hospital , I asked me that my <unk> was at the hospital .
It was very difficult to do that , because it &apos;s not very common to ask a picture of your own <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked to him and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , <unk> , you don &apos;t care .
I think this .
The cure , which is , he &apos;s going to have to deal with all of my being . &quot; &quot; So the next day I would have to have to deal with the I was .
I was decided to change my relationship with <unk> and I was able to learn more about it before to do something as a surgery .
I &apos;m an artist , use several types of <unk> and open information on my job .
So my great bet was spreading all all the stuff , forming the information , and that &apos;s how any of it could be to be able to get it .
So I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot;
In fact I had to <unk> , but that topic we can talk about another talk .
( Laughter ) <unk> this word , &quot; &quot; La <unk> , &quot; &quot; because in Italian cultures means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and why many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; can have a lot of meanings .
In our Western culture , we mean to eradicate or going to the disease , but in other cultures like example of the disease , of the Mediterranean countries , or Africa , can represent many other things .
Of course I &apos;ve been interested to know of the opinion of doctors and the rest of the health care of health , but also interested in the <unk> proposal for the performer by the poet , by the poet , or , for the <unk> .
<unk> social <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> all sorts of <unk> .
And it worked .
The place &quot; &quot; La <unk> &quot; &quot; has around the world .
It takes a lot of attention to Italy and the <unk> and more of 500 people in a very little time through emails through emails , social media — most of the world were counseling as to cure my <unk> , but many more the ones were <unk> to me as a person .
For example , <unk> thousands of videos , images , photos and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have this example of <unk> <unk> and his <unk> .
Or what he did is the performer Patrick <unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> sculpture of my tumor and <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
Now you can also have my <unk> !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s something great , we can share the same <unk> .
And this was what was happening : scientists , experts in traditional medicine , diverse researchers , doctors — they &apos;re all connected to me .
Having all of this information and support , I went to argue that we have to come together to a team of neurosurgeons , traditional doctors , <unk> and several hundreds of <unk> with the time I could talk about the information that I was keeping to talk about the information that I was keeping to tell about the data that was really important .
<unk> , we can formulate a strategy of my own own <unk> in different languages and as different cultures .
So , the current strategy is <unk> the entire world and thousands of years of human history , things that I find a lot of original things .

So I could take my time to go .
It &apos;s called the doctor that I wanted to work , to make the hospital in what I wanted to be , and it &apos;s all the time that thousands of people taught me without feeling worthwhile .
All the world felt that could be <unk> <unk> , and this was the most important part of La <unk> .
What were the results ?
I &apos;m okay , as you can see , very well .
( Applause ) The great news news after surgery : I have — I , I , I had — a <unk> <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> <unk> that &apos;s not distributed .
It was absolutely my life and my lifestyle style .
It was very intense , but it was very intense , but it was very intense , I had a network of electrodes , and it was very intense , I had a computer to build a functional map of what the brain controls .
And just before the operation , we were able to look at this map with the doctor to understand the risks I was going to run , and if there was something that I &apos;d like to avoid .
Obviously , <unk> .
This <unk> was the true key of La <unk> .
<unk> people shared their stories , their experiences .
The doctors came to talk to people who don &apos;t have to <unk> when it &apos;s about <unk> .
<unk> me , I &apos;m in a state focusing on translation of a lot of different languages , where the science is telling you about emotion and graphs of conventional graphs .
&#91; <unk> &#93; The key to <unk> <unk> was a part of a truly committed society and connected , global well-being depends on from each other of their individuals .
This <unk> world is my <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Applause )
I don &apos;t have the idea of what we &apos;re going to play .
I can &apos;t tell you what it is until it <unk> .
I didn &apos;t realize that I was going to be there .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with you with listening .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Well , before nothing , I <unk> <unk> the <unk> Williams in the worm , ( Applause ) — and Christian <unk> on the piano . ( Applause )
<unk> , as we call it , is a incredible space .
It &apos;s a sacred place .
And one of the things that they make sacred is that we don &apos;t tell us the chance to think about the future , or in the past .
They &apos;re really alive in this moment .
There are so many decisions when one goes to <unk> .
We didn &apos;t even know what we &apos;re going to touch .
So we had a <unk> interpretation of a song called &quot; &quot; <unk> Boom . &quot; &quot; But that could happen or not .
We &apos;re all listening . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for the ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : from the view of a jazz musician musician , it &apos;s more easy to talk about the error of another person .
And the way I would take a mistake when I &apos;m in the <unk> — before nothing , we don &apos;t see as a mistake .
The only mistake that you &apos;re not supposed to be able to realize that it &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
Each mistake is an opportunity to jazz .
Even it &apos;s difficult to describe what would be a fun .
For example , if you sit in a color , like if you &apos;re playing with the palette , it requires sonar like this ...
( Music ) If Christian touches a bill ... like <unk> . ( Music )
You see , everything fits in your circle of colors .
If it comes to E .
You see , all of it in the inside of this <unk> emotional palette that we &apos;re painting .
And yet , if you touch <unk> . ( Laughter ) Most of the ears would make a mistake .
You &apos;re going to see , let &apos;s play a moment .
And we &apos;re going to play this palette .
( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music )
And we won &apos;t look at it .
I &apos;m going to play it for a second , and then we &apos;ll try to stop and talk to a moment .
Let &apos;s see that &apos;s what happens when we touch with this palette .
( Music ) <unk> , somebody could play like a mistake .
I just would say it &apos;s a mistake if it &apos;s a mistake if you don &apos;t care at it .
A lost chance .
So it &apos;s been <unk> . Let &apos;s paint it again .
He &apos;s going to play . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to look like , but it &apos;s going to take a look at it .
We &apos;re going to embrace their ideas , or not .
( Music ) Did you see the bill .
And I created a <unk> .
This time the texture changed in the station .
It was a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense for my response .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is if you &apos;re not conscious , if every pill is not conscious , and don &apos;t understand their fellow partners to incorporate the idea and we &apos;re not going to make creativity .
This <unk> is truly incredible .
It &apos;s a <unk> experience .
And I know I &apos;m talking about all when I say we don &apos;t give them all of it .
We know that to be able to rise to the <unk> and make music is a blessing .
And what do you have to see this with finance ?
So we are all jazz musicians , our <unk> is not the most dangerous to finance .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m just going to show you how we &apos;re faced .
And the other dynamic is that we don &apos;t do <unk> on jazz .
There are people who do it .
But that &apos;s easy selection .
If you look at the band that I &apos;m going to look like this , and I want you to get it like this , and I &apos;ll say to you in ...
And it turns out , you &apos;ll have something .
One , two , two , three , four , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s a little <unk> because I &apos;m going to give me the ideas .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> on this side . &quot; &quot; If I want to <unk> music , the best I can do is listen to .
It &apos;s the science science .
It has more than to see how I can perceive what I can do .
If I want to <unk> music to a certain level of <unk> , the first step to me is to be patient , listening to what happens and collect something of what happens around me .
When you do it , you &apos;re going to <unk> and <unk> to the other musicians , and then it &apos;s going to do it .
Look , two , two , two , three , four , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s something completely different about my ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It has many more <unk> .
It &apos;s not about getting my vision .
It is about to be at the moment , and we &apos;re going to take one of the other and let &apos;s get it to the creativity .
Thank you .

He wrote this to his love .
I &apos;m going to be sincere , so that of these wonderful talks and ideas that are being exposed to , they &apos;ll be able to be exposed to the position of getting up here to talk to you to tell you about <unk> .
All the world sees television .
<unk> . I &apos;ll show you some ways .
So here in America &apos;s people .
The media sees the television sees that &apos;s almost five hours on the day .
Well ?
I &apos;m interested in television , so for me , it &apos;s something <unk> .
But the lot of people don &apos;t like .
They were done .
<unk> it is useless , and things worse , <unk> .
My mother , when I was a girl , I would like , &quot; &quot; <unk> box . &quot; &quot; My intent is not <unk> if there &apos;s a good television or a bad television ; my idea today is to tell you that I think the television is .
If I think the television has consciousness is because I think the television reflects directly the moral needs , social and emotional , <unk> in our nation — the television is like <unk> today .
All of it is intrinsic to humans , and we &apos;ll get to the idea of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk about good television or bad .
We talk about <unk> television .
We talk about 10 programs with the audience for a 50 years .
Like that index , not just what you &apos;ve heard , which is the idea of our social and collective , if we don &apos;t also , like that 10 programs in 50 years ago , the idea of our social consciousness ?
How can you take television over time , and what will you tell me about our society ?
<unk> to the topic of evolution , from a basic biology , is that the animal kingdom that the animal kingdom , including humans , has four basic instincts .
<unk> , relationships , power , and the desire of <unk> .
As humans , what we &apos;ve figured out is that we would remember it , we &apos;re going to take it up with time to <unk> or <unk> these basic animals .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel fear , compassion .
This is not that in the animal kingdom .
The other thing is <unk> humans is we love the entertainment .
You &apos;ll see the television .
This is something that makes us clear from the animal world .
As animals can play , but they didn &apos;t look at it .
So I &apos;m aiming to discover what you understand from this exclusive relationship between humans between the television shows and human consciousness .
Why evolved this way ?
The kid <unk> like cartoons of the Age and <unk> sitting in our shoulder .
The television works like our consciousness , <unk> and <unk> at the same time ?
To try to challenge these questions , we did a research study .
We took 50 years to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> Foundation — thousands of programs .
We talk to 3,000 people &apos;s almost <unk> — about 18 and 70 years , and I think it &apos;s emotionally <unk> .
How would you try to look at each one of these programs ?
Do you make a moral <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> ?
What meant for you ?
For our TED audience , I mean , this <unk> cable in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of emotional needs are universal .
And second , 80 percent of the most popular programs of the U.S. <unk> to the rest of the world .
I wish our audiences to recognize whether they feel <unk> .
I want to give you the course of two people before I spend to the first slide slide : <unk> inspired even to think about the idea of consciousness and the <unk> that consciousness you can tell us on the day the day , let me go .
And so what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to give you the data , I want to give you the stuff thanks to the <unk> limb of Hans Rosling .
Well , let &apos;s go back .
So here you see , from 1960 to 2010 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things that we &apos;re going to begin to start the state of medicine and the state of moral <unk> , which , for this study , we define the inspiration as the television shows that they make me feel better with the world .
<unk> moral are the programs that don &apos;t require the distinction between good and bad .
At principle , you see that in 1960 , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we see the television .
<unk> starts to mobilize .
I just just end of the end of the 60 , moral compass , and the <unk> .
Why ?
The city of <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> of the communist rights , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> scandal .
Look what happens .
1970 the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> moral <unk> .
<unk> , more Ronald Reagan , a television president , is the control .
It &apos;s going to get up to the flight .
But look , you can &apos;t , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Chernobyl .
<unk> moral becomes the dominant tendency from 1990 to the next 20 years .
You &apos;ll take a look at this .
This chart shows a similar tendency .
But in this case , we have the happiness <unk> <unk> <unk> that &apos;s social and <unk> in blue .
At that time in television we have &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the national programs that <unk> happiness .
It &apos;s going to increase . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> starts to rise .
<unk> the social contagion increases .
We come to 1969 and look what happens .
The happiness , the <unk> and the social mutants , are not just fighting in our society , but it &apos;s called <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , which in 1969 are number two and number three .
What was the number one ?
The series <unk> socially marginalized , <unk> and Martin &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We all agree together .
<unk> responded very spectacular .
Let &apos;s look at this green peak in <unk> with the trends .
When you get the term , successful without precedent , you mean ?
I mean , in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the first program that I was going to remember to wonder to say , &quot; &quot; My god , I can comment what I think of the Cold War , the president , the television , through the television ?
Well , the equal than the last graph look what happens .
1970 , <unk> <unk> . <unk> .
We don &apos;t see the television by entertainment .
The social theory and the <unk> <unk> <unk> is over 70 .
Now look at this .
<unk> <unk> ?
We have all the teachers , <unk> and <unk> , and the main program in the <unk> <unk> .
In 50 years of television that we study , seven of the 10 programs were thrown out during the Cold War , five of the <unk> <unk> during <unk> <unk> .
Just a generation , in 20 years , and we &apos;ve discovered , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh ,
Could we feel that ?
Can it <unk> ?
Now , this audience as I knew , I want to tell you that the people of digital people don &apos;t have the problems .
Archie Bunker was pasted outside of his <unk> , along with the rest of us .
This is another graph . In other <unk> : <unk> and imagination , who are programs tested like , &quot; &quot; <unk> of reality , &quot; &quot; and it makes me feel better .
I &apos;m going to tell you every time that <unk> and imagination will be a <unk> <unk> .
We want to see programs about people saving money and I stop ?
No . In the 1970s , we have the leader &quot; &quot; The woman <unk> &quot; &quot; who is going to be the <unk> <unk> in 1973 , followed by the man of six million dollars — another peak of programs in control and power .
What was those programs ?
<unk> and rich .
At Dallas , &quot; &quot; <unk> Island &quot; &quot; .
A <unk> shows of our national psyche with rapid analyses and tough : the pause .
Now this , my favorite graph , because these are the last 20 years .
<unk> or not in my <unk> , sure that you &apos;ve heard or <unk> about the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
As we say this <unk> , the X brand the place .
<unk> , the 1950s , <unk> like &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay , a little stop .
But look , the X mark .
In 2001 , in September of 2001 , Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
Why not ?
We had presidential presidential <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> technological failures .
<unk> of September .
<unk> <unk> in part of the social lexicon .
And I think it happens in time .
In the 18th century , Internet <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
What do you want people to do ?
I &apos;ll tell you that <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> happiness , my world comes down .
They don &apos;t , they want to judge .
I can <unk> outside the island .
I can do the daughter of the <unk> Sarah Palin .
I can get there the new <unk> . You &apos;ll get it .
Great , right ?
<unk> in the very different things that are these programs , from pure entertainment , were there for 50 years — that was what I said at the principle of principle .
We are animals , we need our counterparts .
There was no time a couple of television without a <unk> and <unk> mother .
At the 1950s , June <unk> in the <unk> program , &quot; &quot; Trust us . &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> through the <unk> of social consciousness .
<unk> <unk> , the archetype of <unk> <unk> , who talked about abortion , <unk> , even from <unk> on television .
In the 1980s , it &apos;s got the first <unk> <unk> .
<unk> Brown Brown has a <unk> when you had an idea of being mother .
The mother of this was , <unk> Van <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s an object or a <unk> sitting in our consciousness , sitting in your consciousness , what I know is this picture .
So all of you , women and men from <unk> , the audience of <unk> , thanks to the <unk> of my favorite idea of television .
But it &apos;s also going to give you the <unk> to <unk> that if you take it into the morning to make their ideas in our screens over the years of these years .
Dan <unk> his life on television , safe , but you know how to fix it , through a collective social consciousness , and it &apos;s empowering or not .
So thank you so much .

In 1994 , I walked in a prison card and I met a 12-year-old child who was beaten and what he was making access to a lawyer .
And by the <unk> of the eyes I realized that the hundreds of letters that had written the policy-makers in the policy-makers , never to make any letter to him , because it wasn &apos;t a 13-year-old boy who was doing something important for somebody .
It wasn &apos;t a political system .
It was a 12-year-old eight-year-old that would take a bicycle .
What I &apos;ve also realized was that it wasn &apos;t only in <unk> , but that &apos;s not only <unk> , but the <unk> countries in the developing world that we <unk> the right to a lawyer and the right .
And I realized I had an incredible <unk> of opportunities for all of us as a global community for all of us as a global community to be able to <unk> the research of research .
The kid we think about torture as a form of torture , or that &apos;s not only for the worst yet , but in fact , the 95 percent of the <unk> today are not to offer politicians .
It &apos;s for people who are in the systems of <unk> <unk> , and unfortunately , they have to torture it is the cheaper way of research , and it &apos;s cheaper than having a lawyer system , cheaper than having a lawyer or access access to healthcare .
The day of today I think it &apos;s possible to us is possible to us as a global community , if we take that decision , <unk> , <unk> and end of torture , and then we take that decision , <unk> and end of three things .
First comes <unk> , the <unk> of power and connection is global warming .
The second is to ensure that there &apos;s a <unk> access and systematic access .
And the third is a commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I started <unk> , and if we were <unk> ?
Could we do something about those 93 countries ?
And I founded the International Indian to <unk> who has as a specific mission to finish with torture how to torture the research of research , and they put it into practice of research <unk> in these 93 countries , <unk> lawyers would take them into a initial phase in <unk> and on courts .
However , my first experiences came out of <unk> and <unk> from my first visit to <unk> , when there was , in 1994 , still less than 10 of the country , because the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And even 20 years later , so there was only 10 of the lawyers in the country , and by so much , to the <unk> in a prison , not only one boy who &apos;s 12 years ago , but that &apos;s what you &apos;re here ? &quot; &quot; Well , they said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to be here since 10 years because my husband committed a <unk> , but you can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a place where it didn &apos;t exist .
The first group of <unk> <unk> , and I still remember , whereas I &apos;ve asked , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do to research ? &quot;
And the living room in silence , and finally , a woman named <unk> , and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I have <unk> more of one percent of people , and I &apos;ve been able to do any research , because they all come with <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I have to <unk> more of one percent of people and I &apos;ve never wanted to get the police
And these advocates have had a value of value to decide to decide to defend and <unk> amongst them to be able to put it into practice of these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where we came up , the 25 together , and the rest behind , and they <unk> it , and they <unk> it , whereas the <unk> left saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re going to do the things in the same way that we &apos;re going to have done to the right now . &quot; &quot; But one day , the perfect case . It was a woman who was handed out of a house .
She said that he actually filmed the person to go back and I believed that I was going to take a look at them in a matter , but the police came , and it didn &apos;t even had nothing on it .
So so then she was <unk> . She had a <unk> , and he was just an abortion .
And when he took his case to a judge , for the first time this <unk> <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence , except for the <unk> of torture and so so it &apos;s going to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the skill started to take some cases over and again and how we &apos;re going to see a little bit of starting the course of the entire story of <unk> .
But it &apos;s not all sounds .
I used to think , then it &apos;s just <unk> ?
Or also happens in other countries ?
But it happens in so many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it happens in so many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it &apos;s happening in so many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it &apos;s happening in so many countries — but it &apos;s happening in many countries — but
In Geneva came in a prison , and there was not a 13-year-old boy , but a year of eight years , I would have a cell phone cell .
Or a woman , I found in arms to his baby , a very beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is so beautiful ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But it wasn &apos;t a baby .
And she told me , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here for it , &quot; &quot; I had <unk> two <unk> and a iron on his baby and still in prison .
And when I went along with the conductor of prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to <unk> it .
A judge would take free off . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can <unk> it , but it &apos;s going to be my prison . The 80 percent of the two thousands of people here are without lawyers . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; And then the lawyers got to <unk> to organize a system where they could take the cases .
And we realized that it wasn &apos;t only the product of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that would take the difference .
For example , in <unk> , what happened was the name &#93; &#91; name <unk> &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; it was , for example , always me , but she had the same way in China , and the same way , in China , always me that it &apos;s a cool <unk> in the desert when you can <unk> .
We &apos;ve seen it , and we &apos;ve seen it , we can &apos;t be able to create fairness , but we don &apos;t need the resources of the resources , and then I would like to say , &quot; &quot; But I want to convince you that the lack of resources never been <unk> to the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And with this company , successfully published the whole lawyers have never been <unk> to <unk> .
So , the solution that we found was that we &apos;ve found it was the background , and then , the <unk> access .
I &apos;ve ever been in <unk> and I decided to take a another group of lawyers , and what I was thinking was that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , now we don &apos;t have police in the streets . The police is one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . The police is one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But here &apos;s a <unk> tens of millions of dollars recently in the development system system .
What is <unk> then ? &quot; &quot; <unk> with one of the development agencies , and they were forming , and it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it &apos;s the normal trend .
It &apos;s also a manual of it , but it &apos;s also great .
And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the lawyers can come to the police station . It was perfect .
<unk> were perfectly formed .
But he said , &quot; &quot; I just have a question . Before we all get to the playground of the improvers , what happened with them while ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , we &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And so because the key pieces are not just the product of the lawyers , but to find a way to deploy our lives systematically to be able to get access to healthcare , because they &apos;re the guarantee in the system for the people who are being tortured .
And while I &apos;m saying this , they &apos;re also aware that it sounds like a &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; yeah , of course , seems like how if I could do it , but I would like to do it in reality ?
And they &apos;re very much the reason why I think it &apos;s possible .
The first one of them is that people about the Earth in the ways of creating miracles thanks to its commitment .
And it &apos;s not just <unk> , who I &apos;ve talked to you about <unk> , but it &apos;s also ineffective for all the world that they &apos;re looking to think of key pieces .
We have a program called <unk> , and we realized that there were people <unk> and who wanted to help , but how we could help them ?
So so it &apos;s a line where you can win five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to win a couple of dollars if you &apos;re given to the fairness .
And there &apos;s 30 <unk> around the world , from the Sri Lankan to <unk> or the Democratic Republic of Congo , which with five billion dollars that have amazing things , through anti-poverty programs , programs <unk> and any way .
And there &apos;s not only these <unk> , but there are also people <unk> who are their contacts and how they can get their contacts .
For example , in China <unk> laws that <unk> the cops could kill them to the people , they would be punished .
And while I was sitting in the middle of our fellow lawyers , I said , &quot; &quot; And how we can <unk> it ? How can we be able to do this if we could <unk> it in practice ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you have money ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay , it &apos;s like this . &quot; &quot; And the 25th of December he has three <unk> members of the Union <unk> , by 14 of the best schools in the world , which if they were <unk> and had a legal revolution , and they got the
I &apos;ve talked about the fact that we need to form and supporting it .
We need to be in practical ways that we need access to healthcare .
But the third and last point , the most important , is that we have been dealing with this .
And usually people say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is very well , but it &apos;s too <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the reason I think this view is interesting is because that was exactly the same thing that if we were going to end up for slavery , they decided to end the slavery .
It started a small group of people who decided to <unk> .
One of our favorite poems of skill , which they share with themselves , is , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve done value , friends , the way we &apos;re going to be , the route is never clear , the route is never clear , and there &apos;s a lot of it , but it &apos;s a lot of it , but it &apos;s a lot of it , but it &apos;s a lot of it , but in the bottom , you &apos;re not <unk> .
And always <unk> , because I know the question is going to be , and it &apos;s going to be a pleasure talking to you right now , but I can do it right ?
<unk> was a four-year eight-year-old when I met him in a <unk> prison in <unk> <unk> . But like <unk> in prison , everybody had a lot .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s a <unk> . And so when it <unk> started to grow , which is what they also grow ?
What I was doing was to pass by the first <unk> , and the second one , and then the third , and then the third , and then we got a lot of <unk> , moved the head to power through and <unk> : from the third to the first one . And I would like to make it a whole thing to go .
And of course , never stopped to visit the whole world every day , but I wanted to visit everybody &apos;s struggling , and by the <unk> , he gave his fingers through .
Or if the cells were dark , it was like iron <unk> and going through his fingers through .
And the most part of the <unk> <unk> that was his best time and his sun , and that &apos;s always the <unk> <unk> . And I thought , here &apos;s a <unk> child .
Born in a prison of a prison without almost anything , without materials , but with a sense of their own journey to <unk> , that in my opinion all in my view of a place . And I told me , &quot; &quot; You couldn &apos;t do it .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I &apos;ll be the only thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ll ask you to have the only thing I can do . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to <unk> it by having a new world with all of us together and invite us to do this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Some people think there &apos;s a formula for the TED Talks , and you offer a talk on a red <unk> .
&quot; Make a story of childhood . &quot;
I had a personal secret .
&quot; <unk> with a <unk> called the action . &quot;
No .
It &apos;s not like this to think of a TED .
In fact , if you &apos;re going to get too much of these mechanisms , you &apos;ll get a <unk> or an emotional <unk> .
But there &apos;s one thing that all TED Talks , they have in common , and I &apos;d like to share that with you , because I &apos;m going to talk to you , why do I think you &apos;re going to talk to me about a lot of great <unk> <unk> , like this .
<unk> with his original talks of audiences , and I learned about them to the secrets of a great talk .
And even if these <unk> and their subjects seem completely different , everyone has a common ingredient .
And it &apos;s like this : The main task as <unk> is to transfer the mind of who you &apos;ll hear a remarkable gift , a stranger , beautiful object we call it .
Let me <unk> it .
This is <unk> .
It &apos;s about giving a TED Talk , and frankly , it &apos;s <unk> .
( Video ) <unk> : <unk> Van <unk> !
( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music )
They &apos;re literally beginning to <unk> the same patterns in brain patterns .
And I don &apos;t just want to tell you that there are any same emotions .
We &apos;re going to make a look at the brain &apos;s brain &apos;s brain .
There are millions of neurons in a <unk> .
But look here , just here : a few millions are connected to each other in a way that represents a single idea .
inside the minds of the entire audience .
It &apos;s like this ; just a couple of minutes , a pattern that involves millions of neurons to one 200 minds , only with people listening to a voice and look a face .
But <unk> , what &apos;s a thought ?
Well , you can <unk> it as a pattern of information that helps us understand and navigating the world .
And the ideas come in a lot of forms and <unk> , from the complex and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Here &apos;s a pair of examples I &apos;m going to show you from the TED stage .
Sir Ken Robinson <unk> is the key of our children &apos;s future .
( Video ) Sir Ken Robinson : What &apos;s going on is that creativity now is that creativity now , and we have <unk> the same status .
Chris Anderson : <unk> Hardy <unk> <unk> is beautiful .

CA : <unk> <unk> <unk> people are more than a single identity .
Video : The one story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that it &apos;s false , that it &apos;s been incomplete , it &apos;s been incomplete .
CA : Well , your mind will take ideas , and you don &apos;t have random .
They are careful connected .
<unk> , make a very complex structure that is your personal view of the world .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain .
It &apos;s like <unk> in the world .
And it &apos;s estimated that millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a little component of your view of the world is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then by the green of this , <unk> it .
But if another component of your view of the world is the idea that leopards is the idea that leopards are dangerous , then the green of this is a little bit different .
So it &apos;s quite obvious that the ideas that make you make your view of the world are crucial .
I think it &apos;s the most insidious thing that &apos;s possible , a drive to <unk> , but wonderful world right there .
Now , the different visions of the world &apos;s world can be very different .
For example , how responds to your view of the world when you see this picture : ( Video ) Dalia Mogahed : What do you think about me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman of faith , &quot; &quot; a man , even &quot; &quot; a man , even &quot; &quot; ?
Or &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; a terrorist ?
CA : Whatever it is the answer , there &apos;s millions of people out there in the outside of a very different way .
If you look at the right way , you &apos;re able to change it , to always be able to change the world and transform their actions so much as much as the future .
And the ideas are the most powerful force that we would take the human culture .
So if you remember that your main task as <unk> is to build an idea in your audiences of the audience , here &apos;s going to go four <unk> to address that task : First , you &apos;ll <unk> your talk to a single idea .
And the ideas are complex things ; you need to reduce the content to be able to get rid of the very simple idea that I &apos;m going to tell you , and have the chance to <unk> it .
You have to make context , share examples , that real .
So I &apos;m going to give you an idea , and I &apos;m going to tell you that it &apos;s a thread that I &apos;m going to give you all of your talk , so it &apos;s all that it &apos;s going to take it through a way .
According to you to tell you a reason why you &apos;re interested in .
Before I begin to build things in the mind of the audience in the audience , you have to have their permission to go into .
And what is the tool to do that ?
Curiosity .
<unk> curiosity is the curiosity of the audience .
<unk> questions , <unk> questions , <unk> to identify why something doesn &apos;t have sense and accurate .
If you can reveal a <unk> in view of the world of somebody else , you &apos;ll get the need to cover that ethical knowledge .
And when you make that desire is much more easy to start to build the idea .
Third , I &apos;m going to give you the idea , a piece of a piece of concepts that your audience knows .
We &apos;re going to get the power of language to weave so that there &apos;s already in the mind of who you &apos;ll hear but not in your language , your language .
You &apos;re where they are .
<unk> the kid who have a lot of terms and concepts like that they are completely mad for their audiences .
Well , metaphors play a crucial job to show you how they fit the pieces , because it would take the shape of the pattern of the pattern , based on an idea that you hear it .
For example , when Jennifer <unk> helped me explain this incredible new biotech called CRISPR , he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , for the first time , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> lets it cut and take it down and take it very easily . &quot; &quot; Well , a graphic explanation like this is a great moment of picking up how it fits in your mind .
It &apos;s important , for so much , to test the talk with friends of trust , and see that parts are happier .
<unk> . Here &apos;s the end — it &apos;s going to be the final advice — it &apos;s been <unk> .
So I want you to tell you that you do this question : What do you change this idea ?
And I need to get honest to the answer .
If the idea is just going to change you and your organization , then , I &apos;m going to say , you probably don &apos;t <unk> the punchline .
The audience will see you .
But if you realize that the idea has the potential of <unk> the day or to change the view of somebody to better or inspire somebody to do things otherwise otherwise , then you have the essential ingredient to a good story , one that can be a gift for them and all of us .
There &apos;s only one 25 percent of what we &apos;ve heard .
I would tell you that the whole days of the days would help us all of the days of the days , I would argue that it &apos;s the <unk> every day , and I think it &apos;s going to help us every day .
( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) with this <unk> goes hard .
And the art of the conversation in the conversation , and the art of conversation , the conversation of conversation , and the art of the conversation , and the art of the conversation , and the art of the conversation , and the art of the conversation , and the art of the conversation , and the art of the conversation , and the art of the conversation and the conversation about the conversation , and the art of the conversation , the conversation about the conversation , and the art of the conversation , the conversation of
A world where we &apos;re not listening to each other , and a world where we don &apos;t hear each other to others .
And I want to tell you and let your ear go to <unk> and recalibrate the ear of the ear to <unk> and recalibrate your ear .
This is by appreciate the ordinary sounds .
For example , this is my <unk> .
We see that the ordinary sounds can be very interesting to get attention .
The sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
Imagine that you are in a street of any place of America and <unk> and <unk> , &quot; Sorry , what &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; <unk> ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) — well , this is the <unk> <unk> , is that it &apos;s <unk> Street .
This is the street 26 , that 27 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; All right . What &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; Well , the apples you don &apos;t have names .
The streets have names , the apples only are <unk> without the name of the streets . &quot; &quot; <unk> gait , a little bit <unk> and <unk> .
Now , imagine you &apos;re in a Saturday of any place in Japan , you &apos;ll see the person who you have on the side and ask questions , &quot; <unk> , like <unk> . &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the Fowler apple and that 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the streets don &apos;t have names .
The apples itself .
Look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s the apple 14 , 15 , 17 .
All of these apples have names . The streets only are the <unk> without the apples of the apples .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you know your house from your house ? &quot; &quot; El <unk> : &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is <unk> 8 .
<unk> 17 , home number one . &quot; &quot; Well , you say , &quot; &quot; All right . But walking up by the <unk> watched the number of houses don &apos;t go . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course . You go in order to do it .
The first house <unk> in an apple is at home .
The second house that we built is the number two .
The third is the number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; I love how we have to go on the other side of the world to tell us about things that we would have to go on to the other side of the world that would be true .
Like , for example , there &apos;s doctors in China who think their work is healthy .
So every month that you &apos;re healthy , you have to <unk> , and when you &apos;re not going to pay it because you believe it in your job . They were rich when you &apos;re healthy , not ill .
( Applause ) We are in music thinking that the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is the same time , the start of the musical sentence . One , two , three , four , four .
But in the music of the west of Africa , a &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> the end of a sentence .
So let me listen to you not only in the <unk> , but in the way you think , two , three , four , one .
And this map is also true and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s one said that you said to any true thing that you say about India , the opposite of it will be true .
So we didn &apos;t have never been doing so much in TED as another place , which for any brilliant idea that we have to have or <unk> , the opposite of it can be true .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
