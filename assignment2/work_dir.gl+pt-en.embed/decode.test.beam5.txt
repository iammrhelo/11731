It was a late afternoon .
<unk> of science <unk> in <unk> , the Union <unk> <unk> .
<unk> my work , but precisely that day would take a little <unk> .
So let me take me away from my fellow Chris <unk> .
( Applause ) Chris <unk> over 30 years ago , so it was the <unk> of the institutions .
I told me that I felt a little bit of <unk> .
I was <unk> a number of questions about the intersection of science and freedoms failures : very interesting .
But I wanted to tell you the <unk> of these problems more expensive , a way I could expect a difference .
Chris was direct to the big and <unk> : &quot; &quot; All of all of these issues , what are the five of us who are most of you ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; But it &apos;s the genetics of genetics , biological technologies , the <unk> and ...
<unk> , there &apos;s a great thing , the job of the <unk> of the <unk> .
Of course , the subject of genetic fashion . &quot; &quot; <unk> genetic ?
Yes , it &apos;s about human genes .
No !
Will we say that the average U.S. <unk> <unk> of the human body ?
It can &apos;t be . &quot; &quot; <unk> to my <unk> and <unk> was three papers .
And 20 minutes later , he came to him <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! Did you reason ! What do you do ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And this is a big lawyer , but I didn &apos;t know almost anything about the full patents , and absolutely nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but it was not <unk> , much less <unk> .
It was clear that there was a lot to learn before I was given to anyone .
First of all , we had to know exactly what &apos;s going on when somebody else would take a gene .
The object that we can do to make dozens of <unk> , but the most part of all things are called &quot; &quot; DNA <unk> , &quot; &quot; or it &apos;s a piece of DNA that &apos;s called a cell .
<unk> of this says , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t make the genes of your body &apos;s genes , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s true , but more the problem is that we need <unk> the genes for <unk> .
And the patent doesn &apos;t get a particular gene gene , but all of the possible version of that gene that gene looks like .
And what does this mean ?
Yeah , you can &apos;t pass your genes to a doctor and <unk> that <unk> , to see if it turns out , without the permission of the patent <unk> .
It also means that the headline of the patent has the right to stop that gene has been to stop in research or clinical trials .
<unk> who are <unk> , the kid companies , <unk> , <unk> parts of the human genome was the <unk> .
We have the case of <unk> , a small <unk> <unk> , a heart disease , if it &apos;s not about it , it can cause the sudden death .
The company that has <unk> the two genes associated with this disease , to diagnose the syndrome .
But then he came to <unk> and never came to <unk> .
But the company <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
Two years without power to do it .
Over that time , it <unk> died of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem that we would take to patients .
Do you think any way in your front ?
Because it turns out that the Supreme Court stopped , of a long list of cases , there &apos;s a series of things that are not <unk> .
You can &apos;t <unk> products of nature : the air , the water , the minerals , the elements of the table .
It &apos;s not even the laws of nature : the law of gravity , and = <unk> .
They are very crucial things , and they need to be a grasp of all , but they need to be a grasp of all , and they &apos;re supposed to be the grasp of all .
In our opinion , DNA structure , the structure of the most critical life , that we encode the production of all of our proteins , it &apos;s so much a product of nature like a nature of nature , regardless of that if you take in our bodies or in the bottom of a <unk> .
To get better <unk> , <unk> across the country to talk to about different specialists : scientists , doctors , lawyers , of patents .
Most of you who we had right now from a political view , and , when we least in theory , from a legal view .
And all of them thought that the chance of getting out of our own topic were so much like scratch .
But why ?
It turns out that the patents of patents leads to us over 20 years .
It was literally thousands of human genes .
The patents was very <unk> in the status quo , the biotechnology industry we had around this practice , and the whole thing to emphasize that this thing , and the whole thing to emphasize that we had a year after the year of the 19th century .
In short , the courts were not going to be willing to <unk> these patents .
Again , I don &apos;t care and tell us the challenges of the challenges , and that &apos;s us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not enough , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to be more <unk> to follow .
So we started to look at our cause .
<unk> by patents meant to be : <unk> demand to <unk> B by some technical topic .
And we don &apos;t tell us that kind of causes of causes , we think of our causes of causes much more .
<unk> of the scientific freedom , the human progress and the rights of the patient .
So we decided to open a cause that wasn &apos;t going to be like the media that &apos;s by patent , but a cause of the most <unk> rights .
We &apos;ve learned to identify an object that was that he was advocating that he was advocating for his patent troll to organize a <unk> <unk> <unk> and experts who would <unk> the courts like these <unk> <unk> of patients and innovation .
We think the ideal candidate to <unk> was <unk> <unk> , a company with headquarters in Salt Lake City , <unk> .
It &apos;s called the patents of two genes , the genes <unk> and the <unk> .
The women with certain mutations in these genes have more likely to get breast cancer and <unk> .
It &apos;s a total <unk> on the evidence of <unk> <unk> in the United States .
They did a lot of labs on <unk> <unk> evidence of <unk> .
We have a lot of money for their test : over 3,000 dollars .
They had to share their clinical trials with the international science community .
And , if it gets worse , for a long period of a several years , we would <unk> them to focus on their test so that they had been identified by a team of researchers in France .
<unk> that during a couple years ago , until a few years ago , to 12 percent of women &apos;s women would have made a wrong answer : a negative result that should be positive .
This is <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The <unk> of <unk> , Esther , developed cancer with 40 years did work with <unk> .
And he gave it negative .
The family <unk> .
And most likely was that cancer was not going to be present in the family , so the other family members of the family didn &apos;t need to do the test .
Over two years later , <unk> <unk> was a cancer cancer .
It turns out that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> among that 12 percent of people who received a negative result .
If you look at the right outcome , you would look out the right result , you would make the exam , and would you make your cancer cancer .
I could afford these problems .
<unk> genetics , social organizations , four different organizations , four different organizations that we have in defense of 150,000 scientists and professionals , four countries , four scientific organizations that we &apos;ve been able to do , because of the patent .
One of the main challenges we &apos;re facing when we prepare this case was to think how to explain the science .
To argue that what I &apos;ve done was not an <unk> , and that the genes will <unk> the products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , of the guy : What is a gene ?
As if the DNA island , and why isn &apos;t a place ?
We spend hours of hours and hours of time with our <unk> and experts , trying to take a way to explain these concepts that &apos;s more <unk> .
And at the end of the end with the <unk> hand , like the gold .
So <unk> DNA is like to extract gold from a <unk> or a river .
You can see the process to extract gold to extract gold , but you can &apos;t <unk> the gold .
So the way I work with you to extract the gold gold ; you can &apos;t <unk> it , it &apos;s going to be gold .
And the gold one , once came out , you can use it into all sorts of things that you couldn &apos;t use when I was on the mountain ; with him to make it <unk> , for example . But you can &apos;t <unk> the gold .
In 2009 , we were ready to do the case .
<unk> in the face of the Federal War in New York City , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In the poorest of 2010 , the judge <unk> issued his <unk> : <unk> pages .
When you follow your opinion , you &apos;ll get the <unk> with you to describe the science in the case .
I mean , our report — it was pretty good , but not so good .
How could could we develop a profound knowledge of the subject in so little time ?
We can &apos;t even imagine how it was going on something like this .
So it turned out to the <unk> that he was working on the judge , not just a lawyer — it was science .
And not only scientific scientist — I had a Ph.D in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) Wow .
So <unk> appealed to the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And here things are interesting .
First of this case , the global government has changed .
In the court district , the government issued a <unk> <unk> .
But in the direct hand in your own office office , the government would take a report in what you would call this topic to the decision of the court of the district district , and <unk> that DNA will not be <unk> to be <unk> .
This was very important , and absolutely unexpected .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> leads all of the Federal Reserve , and it &apos;s called its <unk> <unk> .
So even with this event that <unk> <unk> , I <unk> <unk> .
And so it was .
More or less .
The decision was 2 against one .
But the two of the two meditators who voted against us , they wrote by very different motifs .
The first one , the judge <unk> , has created its own and new theory theory , totally wrong .
( Laughter )
We will never forget that , why I had no sense .
The other judge , the <unk> Moore , said that we &apos;re going to take us through ourselves to be DNA by a product of nature .
But I don &apos;t want to <unk> the patent industry . &quot; &quot; The third one , the judge <unk> , gave me the reason .
You have to make a question that you have to ask you to respond to the court .
So , these questions <unk> the shape of a paragraph paragraph , a kid , a lot of a lot of <unk> , where it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
We &apos;ve done that there was the shortest question that we never received .
Five words : Am I <unk> human genes ?
When Chris asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; Well I don &apos;t know .
I think it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> DNA ? &quot; &quot; No .
I want them to get the same reaction I had the same reaction I had to talk to about this topic seven years ago , and of course , I was going to say I ?
The Supreme Court only <unk> around one percent of the cases that we call it , and we &apos;ll hear our own .
It gets the day of oral oral <unk> , and it was very , very exciting — with a lot of people outside , the people who I &apos;ve experienced since 2 : 30 from the next to try to get into the <unk> .
Two organizations with the cancer cancer , two million people are going to get a <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
Chris and I <unk> together in the hallway , before he was going to defend the most important case of his career .
I was much more nervous than he .
But all of that panic that <unk> <unk> when I got in the room , and I saw myself a lot of <unk> <unk> : women who were known as much of their own careers — women who would have known a lot of time from their own careers in order to undertake this fight , representatives of a diverse spectrum , a diverse spectrum , a diverse spectrum , a diverse spectrum , a diverse spectrum .
In the room , they were also three leaders of the Human Genome Project , including the <unk> of the DNA , James Watson , who had a report to the court , when he said that the genes was a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> was <unk> .
( Laughter ) Chris claimed she claimed that .
But to me , the hardest thing was to see the <unk> of the Supreme Court trying to understand the DNA <unk> , through a series of <unk> <unk> and dialogues <unk> , in a very similar way how to teach our legal team for the last seven years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> plant .
The judge <unk> <unk> with making a <unk> card from a tree .
And when it was the doubt of my favorite moment , the <unk> Renaissance found that the <unk> DNA was the nature of it .
A natural segment is a product of DNA is a product of nature , and it &apos;s not just <unk> .
And what &apos;s more , it didn &apos;t have made it nothing . &quot; &quot; So , we and four hours after the decision , five labs will remind us that we would have to <unk> the test for the <unk> genes .
Some of them would take us off the cheaper exams than <unk> .
Some of you have <unk> a more <unk> test that <unk> <unk> .
But the decision of court was going beyond <unk> .
And I would take you with a couple of 25 years that we would have <unk> human genes in the United States .
<unk> <unk> that it was innovation and research .
And they helped patients like <unk> , <unk> , and he had access to the exams they needed .
A few weeks after that court was going to take a few weeks after that court , I got a little package on the box of email .
It was Bob <unk> , a teacher from <unk> University and one of the first people that I and Chris went to go to visit a book of <unk> and one of the first people that I and Chris went to visit a book of <unk> and one of the first people that I and Chris went to visit , and I went to visit Bob <unk> , and one of the first people that I and Chris went to go to visit , a teacher from Sydney University and one of the first people I and Chris went
( Laughter ) So I got a lot to this case .
Now , part of what gave us the courage to address those risks was to know that we were doing the right thing .
The process lasted almost eight years since the beginning , with a lot of <unk> and <unk> in the way .
Of course , lucky helped to help , but they have been the communities that are <unk> , and the <unk> that we created , the ones we have to have , the ones we &apos;ve created .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to show you a <unk> from eight of my projects , made by <unk> artist <unk> .
We called <unk> <unk> &amp; <unk> &amp; <unk> &amp; <unk> &amp; <unk> &amp; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , what I call &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The Great letter . &quot; &quot; <unk> in the peculiar habit of my uncle constantly taught that he does something for him , almost as if I was an extension of his body — turning the lights out of a water or a package of tobacco .
When I grew up , the thing was the worst , and we &apos;ll see how a control form .
Of course , he couldn &apos;t say nothing because the uncle is a very <unk> figure in the <unk> .
What &apos;s more <unk> and <unk> was his use of the phone .
He <unk> his <unk> and <unk> that I <unk> the number for him .
In response , and how gift for my great uncle , <unk> &quot; &quot; The Great letter . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that they have been missing two people to use .
It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a <unk> cell phone to a person .
The problem is that when I went home and I went to university , I started to university , I started to see the least its commands .
So I had a machine writing machine with what he could give their commands to <unk> <unk> and <unk> from all the world through emails .
What I had to do was take a paper , put the paper on the car , writing the paper on the car , write email and pull the paper .
This device called him automatically automatically the person in a matter of philosophy .
So here you can see that there &apos;s a lot of electronic distances that you understood all the things that you understand all the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
So my name is only a mechanical interface .
And since then , the object has to be fantastic , and he has a touch of <unk> , like like my uncle .
The next job is a sensitive device to be called &quot; &quot; The <unk> . &quot; &quot; We wanted to work with the <unk> of being surrounded by an <unk> of <unk> creatures , sensitive sensitive and sweets .
This works like this . We have these <unk> here on the wall , and behind that , we have these little things that are <unk> .
Instead we get in silence , <unk> .
And if there &apos;s more silence , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
And at the very least one , I think , again .
So we have this <unk> in three walls from a room .
And we had some 500 of these little <unk> <unk> behind .
And so it &apos;s how it works .
This is a video prototype prototype .
When there are silence , they go back to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> like humans or the real creatures .
And it &apos;s going to give you the sound of the sounds that you &apos;re going to do .
Don &apos;t respond to the sound sounds .
<unk> a train at a moment when you don &apos;t respond .
( noise ) But you respond to the sounds of the first plan .
( <unk> ) We worked very hard to do the more realistic realistic possible .
Each <unk> has its own behavior , the psyche , the mood , personalities , etc .
This is a very premature prototype .
Of course , it was the best after that .
We did it to help people , but we &apos;ve seen that people was a lot of <unk> and infant with them .
This is a video device called &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; So we were really struck by the idea of play with the invisibility of invisibility .
How would it be possible to experience invisibility ?
We worked with a trade company in <unk> <unk> , and we asked them to make a software with us using a camera that could look for people in the room , then next people , and take a person with it with a low background , <unk> news .
I &apos;ll show you a very premature prototype .
In the right , you can see my colleague <unk> , which , in fact , is in space .
And on the left , you &apos;ll see the video <unk> where the camera does invisible .
<unk> enters the fourth . Wow .
You can see as a camera .
It &apos;s a premature video , so you don &apos;t have to <unk> the <unk> and all of that , but it &apos;s going to take it soon , more on .
This was a room in a room where there was a camera looking at space and we had a monitor on each wall .
And second people would take it into the room , and it &apos;s going to make people in the room , except for a distinction : a person was constantly invisible to where they want to be in the room .
This work is called &quot; &quot; The shadows of the sun . &quot; &quot; It was almost like a piece of paper , like a <unk> of a child &apos;s license of oil or a sun .
So in front of this object , this is going to be very strong and robust and robust , almost pretty weak .
People are <unk> by the room and almost <unk> thinking that it was some <unk> .
But in the corner , it &apos;s going around , and it &apos;s going to get it up by the wall .
<unk> and <unk> always .
( Laughter ) This work is a <unk> of a setback .
His head is so heavy , filled with heavy thoughts , which looks like it falls in his <unk> and his body body grows into it almost like a plant .
What it does is move around from your head as if you had a portrait of a very concise movement and it &apos;s going through a slow motion .
It &apos;s like thank you for that circle .
Because if that circle wasn &apos;t there , and the soil outside the ground , it &apos;s going to go back into the space .
And there &apos;s no wires .
Let &apos;s give you an example . When people comes into the room , this object goes .
And very slowly , in a minutes , in the minutes , it gets genuine , it gets the speed and it looks like it &apos;s the point .
This is an important moment , because we wanted to celebrate the viewer a instinct of going and help and save the subject .
We don &apos;t need the needs because he even did it again .
This work was a <unk> challenge for us , and we worked very hard , as most of our jobs , for years to get a mechanic , a balance and an perfect definition .
It was very important for us to start the exact moment in what we &apos;re going to do , because if we were going to do it , because if we were going to do it , we didn &apos;t get it , and if we don &apos;t have enough enough , I don &apos;t understand that <unk> , or that effect wanting to go to the help .
I &apos;m going to show you a very fast video where we do a quiz . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my own mate .
Now it &apos;s going to make it nervous , so it &apos;s going to take it .
But you don &apos;t need to do it , because it can get it by itself .
This is a job that we &apos;ve been working with , working with the <unk> skin <unk> with thousands of different <unk> <unk> <unk> , who would take like the night night .
And it &apos;s the scale of the night sky .
And I would like this about a drop in a <unk> way of <unk> , who was <unk> from the age .
The idea was to make something so cold , distant and abstract , like the universe of a <unk> bear , which is very expressive and it &apos;s important .
The idea was that when I looked at the way I look at the way of a <unk> bear and almost <unk> as a hole in space , as if I was going to look at an old night sky .
This is the last job , still in the process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> space . &quot; &quot; Imagine a <unk> of space in the middle of the room , and it &apos;s a little bit of one of you in the middle of the room , and it &apos;s a little bit like you <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This object is in constant <unk> and <unk> to make a lot of people with <unk> <unk> , as if you would expect to hide a secret in their own together or something like this .
We work with a lot of technology , but actually we don &apos;t like to like , because it &apos;s a lot of suffering in our work for years .
But we &apos;re using it because we &apos;re interested in the way that we help value emotions and patterns of behavior in these creatures that we create .
When a creature comes in the mind , and almost as if the creation process was to discover the way that this creature wants to exist , that way you want to take and how you want to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to start asking you a useful trick , not technology , and all the way requires you is this : that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
But before I <unk> , I want to ask you now , even if you take your body to your body and what you &apos;re doing with it .
And see , how many of you are in some form <unk> ?
<unk> , with <unk> legs , <unk> <unk> .
Sometimes you put your arms like this .
Sometimes it &apos;s <unk> . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll tell you that I see .
<unk> attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re going back to this one in the minutes , and I hope that if you take a little can change the development of your life .
Well , we &apos;re <unk> with the body language and <unk> , especially the local language of other people .
You know , <unk> ... ( Laughter ) A little bit up — ( Laughter ) an interaction on it , a smile on the eye , a <unk> standing up or even something like a seat .
Narrator : So here are the number 10 .
This cop is lucky and open to the president of the United States .
There &apos;s the first minister — No . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy <unk> : A bottle of hands , or his <unk> , he could tell me about weeks and weeks .
The BBC and the New York Times .
So when you think about it in sound , it &apos;s not verbal or verbal language — ( Laughter ) we call it not to verbal language .
When we talk about communication we think about interactions .
What about your body language ?
What do you talk to me ?
There are reasons to believe that this is true .
Sociologists spend a lot of time and we spend a lot of time , or from other people , about the <unk> .
We make <unk> and <unk> language .
These <unk> can actually predict how important it can be important in life like who we would <unk> or we lived or we ask a quote .
For example , <unk> <unk> , researcher at the University of <unk> , demonstrates that when someone sees 30 seconds of video videos without a real <unk> <unk> of the <unk> physician if that doctor will be <unk> or not .
So he doesn &apos;t have to see so much if the doctor was or not <unk> , but with you like that person .
It &apos;s even more <unk> , Alex <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> of the political candidates of the entire career and the Senate &apos;s the Senate , in the digital <unk> , the <unk> means in the <unk> and the Senate can lead to higher value to that <unk> .
If you do a bad use of theirs is bad idea , right ?
Much of language is not verbal is to talk about how we <unk> others , and what are the consequences .
But we tend to forget the other audience in which it impacts our language is not verbal , that we are ourselves .
<unk> our language is not verbal , our thoughts , feelings and physiology .
How can language you don &apos;t want to be talking about ?
I &apos;m going to be a social psychologist . I study the <unk> and I teach it in a business school , so that it was inevitable that I would take myself dynamics of power .
<unk> about all of their own <unk> don &apos;t secure and <unk> .
What are the ones not <unk> and <unk> ?
Well , it &apos;s like this .
In the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom
With this big , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , basically <unk> , basically <unk> .
It &apos;s about <unk> .
And it works like this in the animal kingdom , but it works like this .
It doesn &apos;t limit only to <unk> .
Humans do the same . ( Laughter ) They have to have the same . ( Laughter ) They have to have power in the time .
This is especially interesting because it tells us the ancient , universal , universal that are these <unk> <unk> .
This expression is known as it was , and it was studied by Jessica <unk> , and this expression , the <unk> , the <unk> , was studied by Jessica Jessica .
And that tells us that both people who tell us that both people that you see as much as they &apos;re born as the people who are blind people who are blind people who are blind to make a physical competition .
So when you zoom into the line and make it doesn &apos;t matter if you never saw one of it .
They &apos;re just like this .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> : <unk> .
What do we do when we feel helpless ?
We ask the opposite .
<unk> . <unk> .
<unk> small .
We don &apos;t want to <unk> with who is our own .
And both animals like humans do the same .
And this is what happens when we take power with helplessness .
What we tend to do when it &apos;s about power is empowering language , not verbal language .
So if somebody has to be very powerful with us , we tend to have some smaller experience .
We do the opposite .
If I see this behavior in the class , what would you do ?
<unk> that students from MBA will take all of language will not be verbal .
There are people who are <unk> from <unk> , come into class , <unk> in the way before I start as a class .
When you sit down , they appear to appear .
<unk> your hand .
And then there are other people that are going to get rid of them .
It was <unk> in his face and in his body , sit in the chair , and they &apos;re going to go back , and they do so when it <unk> the hand .
So here watch two things .
One doesn &apos;t tell you .
You &apos;ll have to see with sex .
Women are more likely to do that men .
Women will always always be fewer powerful with men , so that &apos;s not surprising .
But the other thing I &apos;ve noticed is that seems to be related to the Cambridge grade of the students of students and his level of one event .
And this is very important at the time of MBA , because it counts to the average of the bill .
So business schools have been fighting with <unk> <unk> .
<unk> women and men alike , and then you see these differences in the notes , which will be solved by part of the one .
So I started to <unk> : if there are people who come together with that attitude and <unk> , I then started <unk> : if there are people who come together with that attitude and <unk> , and then I started <unk> : if there are people who come together with that attitude and <unk> , then I started <unk> : if there are people who come together with that attitude and <unk> , and then I started <unk> : if there are people who come together with that attitude and <unk> , and then I started <unk> :
It would be possible to do that to be possible to be able to do that other <unk> and that would be possible to participate more ?
My collaborator <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s in Berkeley , and I wanted to know if you can get it to do it .
So , you can do it just for a moment , and I experience a result in your behavior that makes you feel more powerful ?
We know that language will not look at what other people feel and they think of us . There &apos;s a lot of evidence .
But our question was , whether language is not verbal language , what we feel and think of ourselves ?
There are some evidence that this is .
For example , we smile when we &apos;re happy , but also when we get the <unk> to laugh , we &apos;re going to feel happy .
It works in the two <unk> .
When it comes to power , it &apos;s also working on two <unk> .
When we feel powerful is more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when it &apos;s been powerful to be powerful , it &apos;s more likely to feel powerful .
Well , the second question actually was , well , we know that the mind would take your body to our body , but it &apos;s also the way that the body will take your mind ?
And when I say , in the case of powerful , what I &apos;m talking about ?
But I &apos;m talking about thoughts and feelings and feelings of <unk> that make these thoughts and feelings , and in my case , talk about hormones .
How is the mind of the powerful compared to what they &apos;re not ?
The powerful people tend to be , it &apos;s not surprising , but it &apos;s not surprising , but more optimistic .
They have the feeling that they &apos;re able to win even in <unk> games .
They also tend to think of a more abstract way .
And there &apos;s a lot of difference . We would get more risks .
There &apos;s a lot of difference between the powerful and the powerful ones that are not .
<unk> also is a difference in two key hormones : the testosterone , which is the hormone of the <unk> , and the <unk> , which is the hormone of the stress .
The males are taught with a lot of power in the <unk> of <unk> have a high levels of testosterone and levels of <unk> , and the powerful leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders .
What means this ? By talking about power , I &apos;m going to talk just the testosterone , because I had to see with <unk> .
But the power also has to do with our reactions to stress .
We want a dominant leader , with lots of testosterone levels , but sensitive to stress ?
It doesn &apos;t , truth ?
We want a person who is powerful , <unk> and dominant , but not very sensitive to stress , a person who is quiet .
We know that in the <unk> <unk> , if a <unk> has to take control , if somebody has to embrace the control , take suddenly a sudden , in the deadline of the days of the days , his testosterone would take a lot of them and <unk> them as well .
We have that evidence , that the body can <unk> the mind , at least the facial level , and also the paper paper can <unk> the mind .
So what happens when you look at a role of paper ? What happens if you make a minimum level , like this little <unk> or <unk> ?
<unk> : &quot; &quot; I want to talk for two minutes to do this , that will make you experience more powerful . &quot;
We decided to bring people to the lab and do a small experiment , these people <unk> , for two minutes , both the <unk> , of power or weakness , and I &apos;m going to show you right now five of these <unk> , even though they &apos;re just two .
This is one .
A couple more more more than a couple more pair more plus a couple more pair more plus a couple more pair more plus a couple more pair more plus a couple more pair more plus a pair of more more pair , one pair of more more pair , a couple more pair more plus a couple more pair more plus a pair of more pair .
The <unk> press <unk> the <unk> .
Here we have a couple more .
You can stand on , or sitting .
This is the <unk> of weakness .
Now , let me zoom in .
This is very low power .
When we were <unk> <unk> <unk> , really .
This is what happens .
They come in , put it in a jar , and it &apos;s going to go for two minutes , you have to do this or that . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t see the photos of <unk> .
We don &apos;t want to <unk> a concept of power .
We want to feel good power .
They have this two minutes .
And then I <unk> it , &quot; &quot; how powerful you feel ? &quot; &quot; then you &apos;ll get the chance to go , the end we take up the end of it .
That &apos;s all . This is all experiment .
This was what we found .
It would take it to the risk , and you &apos;ll find that when you &apos;re in a position of high power , you &apos;ll get to 86 percent .
When they &apos;re in <unk> <unk> , only 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant distinction .
Let &apos;s see what we found with testosterone .
<unk> from his normal situation to get , people often find a increased increase of the 20 percent and the <unk> experience of the 10 percent .
Again , two minutes , and we &apos;ll look at these changes .
Now the results with <unk> .
The most powerful experience has a 25 percent decrease , the most <unk> experience of the 15 percent .
We just two minutes of <unk> these <unk> changes that would take your brain to do it , safe or <unk> or <unk> , or well to stress the stress .
We all know that feeling , right ?
We would argue that our language will not be verbal to understand the way of ourselves , not just to the other , but the same ourselves .
The body can <unk> the mind .
So the next question , of course , is — can a gesture of power in a very significant life ?
This is the laboratory , this experiment , just two minutes .
Where can we really apply this ?
That &apos;s what we care about .
We think where you need it to be in <unk> in which you <unk> , like in the social <unk> <unk> , you think where you need it to be in <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and you think where you need it to be in <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and we think where you need it to be in <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and we think where you need it to be in <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and we think where you
I &apos;m going to give you your friends .
For the teenagers is at the table table .
For some people , I &apos;m talking about <unk> school .
It may be by making a business or giving a talk like this or going to a job interview .
I &apos;m going to tell you one about the majority of the people that I identify because of the majority of people , the interview job .
So we published the results , the press <unk> , and said , well , this is what you &apos;re going to do when you go to an interview , right ?
( Laughter ) Of course , we have <unk> <unk> and said , no , no , no , no , no , no .
For many reasons , I don &apos;t have that .
Again , it &apos;s not that other people .
This is about you .
What do you do before go to a job interview ?
You &apos;re going to sit . <unk> your iPhone ... or your Android , you won &apos;t leave one outside .
I put your text messages , you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re going to get a little bit , when you really should be doing it is this , maybe the <unk> , it &apos;s going to be doing it , maybe the <unk> , okay .
So that &apos;s what we want to grade .
<unk> people in the lab , and they were <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> interview <unk> <unk> <unk> interview , <unk> people in the lab .
After five minutes of <unk> .
And also the ones are <unk> , and the <unk> are going to get them to don &apos;t mean whether they don &apos;t want to <unk> it .
Imagine that this person should be interview .
For five minutes , nothing , it &apos;s worse than you will .
People do this .
It &apos;s what Marianne &apos;s <unk> calls &quot; &quot; standing in the social media . &quot;
This is the interview to the <unk> , because we wanted to see what <unk> .
We have analysts , four in total .
They don &apos;t know the chance . Don &apos;t know the conditions .
They don &apos;t have the idea that there could take every single person and the end of looking at all the seafarers , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , all the <unk> of the power of power .
We don &apos;t want to hire <unk> .
Do you make a much more positive arrangement in general . &quot; &quot; What was happening ?
It &apos;s not about content content .
It &apos;s the presence of the presence that you have to do with speech .
So , if you look at all of these <unk> <unk> <unk> to the competition , you &apos;ll see it right ?
Do you do it well ? What ratings do ?
These things don &apos;t affect . This is what it is .
This kind of things .
Every person <unk> itself , basically .
<unk> what they are .
<unk> their ideas , for themselves , without any extra .
So this is what it is or <unk> the effect .
When I talk to people about this , that our body changes our mind and behavior can change our way to be , and it &apos;s going to change our way to be , it &apos;s going to look like .
I <unk> : <unk> until you do it .
I don &apos;t look like this .
I don &apos;t want to get there and <unk> like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to <unk> it as a <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to get there to feel that he wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
This is very important to me , because I want to tell a little story about being a <unk> , and it &apos;s going to feel a <unk> and I &apos;m not supposed to be there .
When I was 19 years ago , I was a terrible accident .
You can hear him from him , and I gave a bunch of <unk> .
I was going to visit your car .
<unk> in intensive care unit in the head of college , and I was told that my <unk> <unk> two world was very stressful .
<unk> my <unk> , because I &apos;m going to <unk> it as <unk> , and it &apos;s called a <unk> girl .
So I took my university university and tried to go back .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t let the career .
You have to accept that there are other things that you can do , but in your case this doesn &apos;t . &quot; &quot; So I had to deal with that , and I have to deal with that , and I have to deal with that , and I have to deal with it , and I have to talk to me that I was going to be smart , that it &apos;s the thing more helpless .
We had absolutely misunderstood .
So I worked and worked , and I &apos;ve been working , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky .
Finally came to university .
It was four years more with my fellow women , and I was able to convince somebody , my <unk> , Susan <unk> , so that I was <unk> , and I ended up in Princeton , and I felt like not supposed to be there .
The night before the first course of the first course , the first course of the first course , the first course of the first course of the course of the first course , the first course of the first course of the course of the first course , the first course of the first course of the course of the first course , the first course of the first course of the first course , the first course of the first course of the course of the first course , the first course of the first course of
It &apos;s like this .
I had so much fear of <unk> <unk> the next day I was going , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave you . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re going to leave anything , because I think it &apos;s about you and you &apos;re going to stay .
You &apos;ll be careful , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
You &apos;re going to do all the exhibitions you &apos;re going to do .
It &apos;s just going to do it , and it &apos;s going to be able to do it , and they &apos;re still born and they &apos;re even paralyzed and having a sense of experience , until it goes to the moment that it &apos;s going to get the moment of it .
I got here . I &apos;m doing it now . And that &apos;s what I did .
Five years ago a few years ago , a few years ago , you know , at Harvard , I &apos;m now at Harvard , now I &apos;m not thinking about it , but for a lot of time I had the feeling that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
At the end of my first year at Harvard , a student who didn &apos;t take the class in the whole class , to what we call it , &quot; &quot; Look , you have to participate or go , &quot; &quot; he came to my <unk> . I didn &apos;t know before .
Totally <unk> , me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t should be here . &quot;
That was my moment .
Because I &apos;m going to tell you two things .
The first one I realized : <unk> ! I don &apos;t feel like this .
I didn &apos;t feel like this , but she &apos;s going to get it in his place .
The second was , of course , to be here .
So let &apos;s zoom in it and it can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course . Yes , yeah . Yes . &quot;
It &apos;s going to be <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> it , and you know what — ( Applause ) You will go to the class and you &apos;re going to give the best speech of everyone . &quot; &quot; And you know ? They did the best speech in all of all . &quot; &quot; And you said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t have to <unk> it , but if you were there . ( Laughter ) She came up to me for a few months later , and he had no <unk>
And so we <unk> it .
Now I want to tell you that there &apos;s no way to do it .
There are also us to turn out .
There are so long that it was going to take and <unk> .
The last one I &apos;m going to say is this .
<unk> changes can lead to large <unk> .
It &apos;s just two minutes .
So before I went to the next situation where I was going to <unk> , for two minutes , I would like this , in the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
This is what you have to do .
It &apos;s called the brain to get the best of that situation .
They gave them the testosterone .
We don &apos;t have any <unk> of it , but I didn &apos;t know who are .
<unk> of that situation with the feeling that I &apos;m going to say who I &apos;m going to tell you who are and I want you to prove who you &apos;re going to tell you who are and I &apos;m going to prove you who are and I &apos;m going to prove you who are and I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re going to show you that I &apos;m going to tell you who you are .
I want you to <unk> before anything that would take a position of power , and I also want to <unk> the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My ego doesn &apos;t depend on this . ( Laughter ) <unk> , <unk> people , because the best you can use are those without technology , without technology or power or power .
We &apos;re going to talk to them because they can do it in private .
They just need their body , privacy and two minutes to change the <unk> of his life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is the most big problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The architect <unk> &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s a good option .
( Laughter ) Rather than I &apos;m going to talk about what are the big problems in the world ?
And I should say , before I go , I &apos;m going to <unk> each one of you who <unk> <unk> and paper because I &apos;m going to ask me to see how we do it .
So I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> and paper .
So finally , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world outside there .
I &apos;m going to <unk> just a few .
800 million people pass hunger .
One billion people don &apos;t have access to the water <unk> .
Two billion without sanitation .
Three billion people die of HIV and AIDS .
<unk> <unk> .
Two billion people who are going to look really affected by the climate change — and we &apos;ll get it .
We have many , many , many problems there .
In a ideal world , the <unk> will all , but we don &apos;t .
The truth is that we don &apos;t solve all problems .
And if we don &apos;t do it , the question I think we should do — and that &apos;s the reason why we are in the <unk> economy — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all , we have to start asking ourselves , that problems should solve us first ?
That &apos;s the question I would like to say .
If we were to say , 50 billion of <unk> to spend in the next four years to improve this world , where we should be able to spend it ?
<unk> 10 of the most big challenges of the world and just <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> movements , sanitation , sanitation , sanitation , sanitation , sanitation , sanitation , sanitation .
We think of these , many ways , <unk> the world &apos;s greatest problems .
So , the question would be <unk> , what do you think are the greatest ?
Why should we begin to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s asking about a wrong problem .
In fact , that was the <unk> of what he talked about in <unk> .
But <unk> , there &apos;s a problem if you &apos;re going to get to people who are going to focus on problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
There &apos;s probably the biggest problems we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to solve that , we have ?
So it &apos;s not <unk> problems , but it &apos;s going to <unk> the solutions to the problems .
And it had become — naturally it &apos;s a little bit more complicated .
To <unk> climate change , it would be something like <unk> .
To <unk> diseases , they could be clinics or networks for mosquitos .
To <unk> , they would be the peace forces of the U.N. , and we could keep it .
What I &apos;d like to say was to tell me that I would have to do it , and that in 30 seconds — and I know a lot of way is something impossible — <unk> what you think are <unk> priorities .
And also — in this is , naturally , where the economy goes through — <unk> what we shouldn &apos;t do in the first place .
What should I be at the end of the list ?
Please take it just 30 seconds , maybe it <unk> with people <unk> , and they just imagine what they should be the main priorities and the least <unk> of the solutions that we have to do for the world of the world .
The amazing thing about this process — of course , I mean , I mean , I just have 18 minutes to tell you a important amount of time , right ?
I &apos;m sorry to say , and you &apos;re going to think about this process , and that &apos;s what we actually did .
And I also recommend it , and I &apos;m sure we also have these <unk> , and I &apos;m sure we also have these <unk> , then to think , how do you really really <unk> it ?
Since then , there are some who ask the same , why has never done a list like this ?
And one reason is that <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
Nobody wants to do .
Of course , all organizations will be at the highest of a list like that .
But also all <unk> <unk> will not be at the highest .
And there &apos;s a lot more likely to have no <unk> numbers , which numbers , is logical not to want a list like this .
It &apos;s 60 years ago that there &apos;s the U.N. , and it &apos;s not just a basic list of the big things we can do in the world , and said , what should we do first ?
This doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re not going to take a <unk> — every decision is a <unk> , so we &apos;re not only <unk> — and that &apos;s not sure it &apos;s as good as if we really did it , and that &apos;s not sure it &apos;s so good as if we really did the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of that .
So what I &apos;m emoting to is really saying we had , for a long time , a very long time , a situation in which there &apos;s multiple choices .
There are many , many things we can do out there , but we didn &apos;t have the price , but we didn &apos;t have the price , and we didn &apos;t have the price .
We didn &apos;t have an idea .
Imagine that we would take a restaurant and you have a huge letter , but you don &apos;t know what the prices are .
You know , you have pizza , but you don &apos;t know how it costs .
It could be a <unk> , they could be 1,000 dollars .
It could be a familiar pizza . It could be an individual pizza , right ?
I &apos;ll tell you these things .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to do the <unk> <unk> — it &apos;s to put the price of these subjects .
And so basically , this was the process of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 30 of the best economists in the world , three of every area .
In order to be three of the best economists on the planet &apos;s <unk> about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be their cost ? And what &apos;s good about it ?
The same thing with disease <unk> .
Three of the best specialists saying , what can we do ?
What is the price ?
What should we do about that , and what would the result ?
And so on .
So we took some of the best economists from the world , eight of the best economists in the world , including three <unk> <unk> , <unk> in May in May of 2004 .
So we call the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; The <unk> of Cambridge decided to <unk> the <unk> of the economy .
<unk> works very well in Europe , but here &apos;s not so much .
And basically what they did , was to get a <unk> list .
And then I <unk> <unk> , why ?
And naturally , I &apos;m very happy to ask myself that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The topic is , of course , if you want to know malaria , questions to an malaria on malaria .
If you want to know about climate , questions to a <unk> .
But if you want to know what two you might solve first , you can &apos;t get rid of one of the two , because that &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what economists do .
<unk> .
They have to have this <unk> thing to say , that we have to do first , and we need to do after .
So this is the list , and this is the list that I &apos;m going to share with you .
Of course , you can also see the web , and I &apos;m sure it &apos;s also <unk> of it as a day .
Basically we would take a list in what they said that there was a lot of projects — basically , projects where I &apos;m going to show you a <unk> , and you &apos;ve seen less than a result .
And then they were the same projects , the good ones and the <unk> .
And naturally , they are very good projects that we should start by doing .
I &apos;m going to start from the bottom of the way that we &apos;re going to end with the best projects .
These were the bad ones .
As you can see the end of the list is the climate change .
This offends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things that people will tell you should not be allowed to .
And I &apos;d like to talk about it , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why did it happen ?
And the truth , we also want to talk about this because it &apos;s probably one of the things we don &apos;t be according to the lists of lists .
The reason it turned out to say this is that it &apos;s <unk> — or to make something more than <unk> — it &apos;s not a good business .
It doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s no global warming .
It doesn &apos;t mean a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying that what we can do for that is very little , a very high cost .
What we basically show us , the media , the media models , if all of the world had , if all the world had been according to a hundred billion of the year .
This is an important amount of money .
Twice or three times the global help of the development that we have been in the Third World every year .
And to do very little .
And all the models show that we were going to take a couple of years to <unk> .
So a guy in Bangladesh that we get a <unk> in the <unk> can expect to <unk> .
What &apos;s something well , but not very well .
So the idea and saying , well , we spend a lot of money doing something about it .
And just by giving a baseline , the U.N. estimates that over half of that amount , 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all the main problems in the world .
We could give clean water , sanitation , basic support and education to all human beings on the planet .
So we should be <unk> , we want to spend a very little way ?
Or the half of it do something that &apos;s good for ?
And that &apos;s where it turns out to be a <unk> project .
It &apos;s not to say yes to all of the money in the world , you don &apos;t want to do it .
<unk> , that when we don &apos;t have , it &apos;s not our first priority .
The future projects — I &apos;m not going to comment on all of it — but some <unk> , scale of basic services — they &apos;re just a little bit , just because it &apos;s , the scale of basic services is a big thing .
I &apos;m going to give you a lot of it , but it &apos;s also , but it &apos;s really <unk> .
Again , what it tells us and suddenly we started thinking about two sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , it &apos;s an awful lot of projects of sanitation .
Again , sanitation and water is really important , but it also costs a lot more infrastructure .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four <unk> priorities that they should be , when they should be , at least , the first one to solve when we talk about how we should solve the problems of the world .
The bigger fourth is malaria — treat malaria .
<unk> of malaria is about a couple of millions of people — every year .
You could even have a <unk> point of GDP as GDP as the year for nations .
If we took a few billion dollars in the next four years , we could reduce the decline of half .
We could prevent the death of 500 people , but what perhaps is most important , we could prevent a billion people if we ate every year .
<unk> <unk> his ability to treat many of the other problems we have to deal with . Of course , in the long run , it &apos;s also the <unk> of global warming .
The third one is the free trade .
Basically , the model showed that if you were able to reach the free trade , and especially <unk> <unk> in the United States and Europe , we could basically rise to the global economy until the <unk> half of the year , the half of the year of the Third World .
Again , we could actually take 200 or 300 million people from poverty , radically , very fast , between two and five years .
That would be the third thing that we could do .
The second thing was to be <unk> in <unk> .
We don &apos;t have any <unk> , but it &apos;s a very economic way to treat the <unk> , is to say , the lack of <unk> .
Basically , the population of the world &apos;s population has made of iron , <unk> , <unk> and vitamin D A.
If we took 12 billion dollars , we could make a deep <unk> in that problem .
This would be the second best <unk> we could do .
And the best project was to be <unk> in HIV / AIDS .
Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could avoid 28 of new HIV .
Another time , what this does , and what makes it happen to say that we have two different ways how to treat HIV / AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is <unk> .
Again , in a ideal world , we would make the two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t make any of the two or where we don &apos;t do it very well , we should be able to do that , we should be able to invest first .
And the treatment is much , much more expensive than <unk> .
So <unk> , what this meant was to say that we can make a lot more investing in the <unk> .
Basically , we moved to the amount of money that we can do it X in treatment , and 10 times more in <unk> .
So again , we have continued to figure out more than as treatment as the first option .
What this makes us is really important to think about our priorities .
I &apos;m going to say to you like the list of <unk> and say , <unk> ?
How do we get there ?
Well , <unk> , one of the things is again to <unk> climate .
<unk> a lot of people who think it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very little likely to do that .
We also should make climate change , if there &apos;s no other reason , just because it &apos;s a big problem .
But naturally , we don &apos;t press all the <unk> .
We have many problems in the world .
And what I want to tell you is that if you focus on problems , we will take us further .
Those we can do a lot more better than a little bit .
And I think the truth — Thomas <unk> , one of the subjects of &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which explained very , very well .
One of the things that people <unk> , and that in a hundred years , when we &apos;re talking to the majority of the majority of climate change , people will be much more rich .
Even the most <unk> impacts of the United States is even <unk> in the U.N.
<unk> that a media person in the developing world will be as rich as we are today .
And much more likely , we are going to be two to four times richer than we are .
And naturally , we &apos;ll be even more rich than that .
But the thing is , when we talk about saving people , helping people in Bangladesh , we &apos;re not talking about a poor <unk> .
We &apos;re talking about a very rich <unk> .
And so the real topic , naturally , which is , we want to spend a lot of money to help me a little bit about here to 100 years .
or we want to help people the poor , or we want to help the poor people , these moments in Bangladesh , who need to really help people , and who can actually help <unk> ?
Or as the <unk> said , imagine , imagine rich rich — how will happen — a rich <unk> , a wealthy <unk> , a wealthy <unk> , a rich <unk> in <unk> thinking in 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How do you get so much by taking a little bit with this topic of climate change , and if you take it so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think what we really do is we need to put our priorities in order .
Even if you don &apos;t agree in the typical way to see this problem .
So of course , it &apos;s fundamentally because there &apos;s no reason to <unk> climate .
You know , we have <unk> El <unk> — it seems great , not ?
It &apos;s a good movie movie in the sense that I want you to see , right , but I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to break it up to it by picking it up on your next movie <unk> movie <unk> in Tanzania or something like this . ( Laughter )
So in many ways , I think the <unk> <unk> and all the discussion about the priorities of the priorities is a defense of the multifaceted problems .
To make sure that it &apos;s not just possible to make a good thing , but to make sure that it &apos;s not just possible to try to feel well .
It &apos;s not going to do the things that have the greatest <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s also going to be going on places where we can actually make a bigger <unk> .
The other objections , I think , who are some important , is that some <unk> I &apos;m — or we &apos;re — we &apos;re going to give you a false choice .
Of course , we have to do it all , in a ideal world — it would actually be accurate .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t do it .
In 1970 , the developed world decided that we were going to spend twice what we &apos;ve done , right now , in 1970 in the developing world .
Like our help rise to half .
It doesn &apos;t seem like we &apos;re in the way to solve all the big problems .
In the same way , people also say , but there &apos;s the war in Iraq ?
You know , we spend 100 billion <unk> . So we &apos;re not going to do it in the world .
I &apos;m <unk> .
If some of you can talk to the Bush to do that , it &apos;s okay .
But of course the theme is still saying , if you &apos;re going to take other other 100 billion dollars , you can &apos;t want to make it better .
So the real problem is to start and think of what &apos;s the appropriate priorities .
Could I mention briefly , is this really the wrong list ?
You know , when you ask questions to the best economists in the world , we &apos;re going to break it through the white men and old men from the United States .
And they &apos;re not necessarily a cool way to look at the entire world .
So let me give you the 80 <unk> of all the world to <unk> the same problem .
The only two requirements were that they were studying in university , and that &apos;s English .
Most of them were , first , in the developing world .
They had the same material , but they could have <unk> <unk> of the topic of discussion , as they really did , to <unk> their own lists .
And the amazing thing was that the list was very similarly — with <unk> and disease and disease , the end of the end .
We have done that many other times .
We had many other <unk> and students university and university students .
They all had as a result .
And that &apos;s a really hope , really , to say I think there &apos;s a way in front of it to start thinking about our priorities . And say , what &apos;s the most important of the world ?
Of course , in a ideal world , we &apos;re going to do it all .
But if we don &apos;t do all , we can begin to think about why ?
I see <unk> <unk> as a process .
We did in 2004 , and we hope to get a lot more people , to get a lot better data in 2008 , 2012 .
It &apos;s called the right path to the world , but it also start thinking about political <unk> .
To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t make the stuff where we can win a little bit with a high cost , and the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but we make it really great things where we can do an enormous thing , the low cost , right now , at the end of the day , you can be in odds with the discussion of how we can actually <unk> , but we have to be honest and <unk> to say , if there &apos;s some things that
If we don &apos;t care a lot about some things , I &apos;m going to try to worry about each other .
So I hope I &apos;m hoping that this is going to help us understand the priorities , and think about how we worked better for the world .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I was left outside the house without keys .
He had had to come home home to the house , and I was going to go home to a friend to the other side of the city of the city , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to talk to you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to talk to you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to talk to you . &quot; &quot; (
And I was in <unk> , looking at the pocket and <unk> account that I had no keys .
In fact , I could walk through the window outside of the table table , where the <unk> .
But they were all <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t <unk> night in my friend &apos;s house because the morning I had a flight to Europe and had to be able to get a passport and <unk> .
So soon , desperate and <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the window to <unk> .
<unk> costs a lot of money but neither else has a <unk> in the middle of the night .
Well , I &apos;m going to tell you about neuroscience .
<unk> <unk> , which elevates the heart rate rate levels of the levels of adrenaline of adrenalin .
So the next morning when I stood up with me , I worried about the window , I worried about the window of course , and the <unk> that was going to be in Europe , and the <unk> that was going to be in Europe , and the <unk> that was going to be in Europe , and the <unk> that was going to be in Europe , and the <unk> that was going to be in Europe and the <unk> that was going to be in Europe , and the <unk> that was going to be in
And until I get to the airport , I didn &apos;t think I was a passport .
So I went back to the house , with the snow and ice , in 40 minutes I took my passport , I came back at the time , but I &apos;m going to give my seat the other person to another person .
Or , in the case of that bad things , it &apos;s going to be bad things .
And Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me
It was something that <unk> from a psychologist &apos;s <unk> <unk> that was a few years ago , and it &apos;s also called <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a team of specialists who tries to determine what happens , right ?
Well , in the <unk> <unk> , like it explained Danny , it &apos;s going to be Danny , and then you try to determine what you can do to do it .
What I want to talk about today is what we can do to talk about today is what we can do to do today .
A couple of things are obvious , and some are not so much .
I &apos;m going to look at the course .
<unk> places all over home to the things that are going to be easily .
Well , this looks like common sense , and it &apos;s like this common sense of it , and it &apos;s like this common sense of common , and it &apos;s like this common sense of common , and it &apos;s like this common sense of common .
There &apos;s a structure of the brain , called the hippocampus that evolved for hundreds of thousands of years to remind the location of important things , where it &apos;s the <unk> , where you can get rid of it , where they live the tribes in the world where they live the tribes in the world where they live the tribes , and the sun .
The hippocampus is part of the brain .
It &apos;s the part of the brain .
In fact , there was been somebody who did the experiment of <unk> sense of smell of <unk> <unk> sense of <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , in fact , there &apos;s been an experiment that made the experiment of <unk> meaning of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and in fact , there was been an experiment that made the experiment of <unk> sense of <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , in fact , there &apos;s been an experiment that made the experiment of <unk> sense of <unk> <unk>
But it works well with things that don &apos;t get too much and don &apos;t get too much .
So there &apos;s a lot of a place for the keys .
To the passport , a specific <unk> — the exercise of reading , a particular table .
If you look at a place , and if you take a place , you will be able to be in your place when you &apos;re <unk> .
And when you go back to it ? I would take a photo with the cell in the cell ?
It &apos;s called an email with a photo of <unk> to the cloud .
These seem to be obvious .
Remember that when we &apos;re in stress , the brain emits <unk> .
<unk> is toxic and <unk> .
So you recognize that the stress won &apos;t go to the best of you and you should actually start to make a system .
( Laughter ) But when you take a medical decision .
Well , we &apos;ll be somewhere else in a situation in a situation in a situation where we &apos;re all right now in a situation in a situation .
And I want to talk about that .
or whatever we need to do to do something that we need to do to do something that we need to do to do something that we need to do to do , or any decision that we need to do to do to do something that we need to do .
Suppose you go to the doctor and this says , &quot; &quot; I have the results of the evidence , and it &apos;s the cholesterol one . &quot;
You know , you know that the cholesterol button was high .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that it &apos;s not very good .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to ask a statistic of asking you to ask a statistic of a statistic .
It &apos;s the number we need to treat . &quot; &quot; And what &apos;s the <unk> ?
It &apos;s the number of people who have to <unk> medicine , and it &apos;s the number of people who are going to help a person .
And what about statistics is that ?
The number should be one . My doctor won &apos;t tell me something that we don &apos;t help .
But medicine doesn &apos;t work like this .
We don &apos;t know how much the mechanisms are going .
<unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work between one 30 percent and 50 percent of the cases .
So the <unk> in the case of <unk> <unk> what you think is ?
How many people have to solve before they help somebody else ?
This second was the results of the results that this second was about the results of the results that this second was — this second was the results of the results of this second .
I mean , I really recommend the data .
And it &apos;s called <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

And there creates things like <unk> <unk> . <unk> damage on the muscles and <unk> , <unk> <unk> ... ( <unk> , &quot; &quot; One <unk> , &quot; I don &apos;t think of me .
You have to be 15 times more than the drug you would have to do .
I &apos;m not saying if you &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> or not just <unk> <unk> or not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> or not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk>
( Laughter ) But if you want to have this conversation with your physician .
You have to have access to this information to be able to talk to you about to talk about this information to be able to talk about this information to be able to talk to this information to be able to talk about this information to be able to talk about this information to be able to talk about this information to be able to talk about this information to be able to talk about this information to be able to talk about this information to be able to talk about this information to be able to talk about
I &apos;m talking about this number to <unk> , but I &apos;m talking about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which
<unk> prostate cancer is 49 .
Yes , we &apos;ve done 49 <unk> per person who helps .
And the side effects of this case is based on 50 percent of patients .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , the idea of the <unk> <unk> has been able to make the conversation for the conversation .
The ideal is not to have to create all this at the moment .
There &apos;s also some themes like the quality of life .
These are things that we need to think now and coordinate with the family and loved ones .
Remember , under stress , the brain emits <unk> and one of the things that happens at that point is that if you have a lot of systems .
Darwinian evolution is that .
Because if the body <unk> metabolism in these things , it &apos;s because if the body blows in these things , and you don &apos;t have a lot of it , because if the body blows in these things , and you don &apos;t have a lot of it , because if the body blows in these things , and you don &apos;t have a lot of it , because if the body blows in these things , and you don &apos;t have a lot of it , because if the body blows in these things , and you
<unk> , one of the things that you rely on is that if you want to know what you want to do , you know , you know , you don &apos;t want to know what you want to do .
So we need <unk> to think about this kind of <unk> .
And I think the most important is to recognize that we all have <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> it .
The idea is to think about what they can be like to be these <unk> , starting systems that can minimize the damage or just prevent that these handbags <unk> .
And I put it on that night with snow , and when I came back from the journey , I was going back to that night with the head of the house , and when I came back to the door , the <unk> and a easy code to remember .
They &apos;re not absolutely organized to win , and they &apos;re not completely organized to be organized without organized <unk> .
Audience day !
Are they <unk> ?
Anybody ? No . Well , nothing .

You &apos;ll see <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Come on , you see , <unk> of this ! &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Come on , you &apos;ll see it .

At that point I started thinking .
And it was very much .

If you don &apos;t see a problem , it &apos;s better to stop and stop talking about it .
What I mean is that these things would take a specific <unk> .
I have a friend who speaks <unk> from a <unk> .
Once I asked her , I was just going to ask me .
And I told me , &quot; &quot; All right , but I spent a time , but once I spent the entire day trying to <unk> <unk> <unk> , I said , &quot; &quot; All right , but I spent a time , but once I spent a time , I &apos;ve been trying to figure out how I was trying to figure out how I was trying to figure out how I was trying to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and said , &quot; &quot; All right , but I spent a time , but once I spent the

( Applause ) Well , what we did to protect the Arab language ?
And it has been based on civil society .
But still , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you <unk> ?
So I get this kind of thing , and I &apos;m going to make it well .
In the campaign to explore the Arab Spring , the next <unk> : the next <unk> : the next <unk> , the next <unk> , and the next to the Arab Spring : the next <unk> , the next <unk> , and the next to the Arab Spring : the next <unk> , the next <unk> , and the next to the Arab Spring : the next <unk> , and the next to the Arab Spring : the next <unk> , the next <unk> , and the next to the Arab Spring : the next <unk> , and the
We don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Can no &quot; &quot; no . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have any <unk> or this . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have that style , because that way we don &apos;t get rid of it .
And when somebody speaks like this , they hate the Arab .
<unk> ... ( Applause ) We realize we want to change our reality , and to be convinced of a way that we &apos;ve created our dreams , aspirations and the day .
And I think it turns out , and you think how we think about it .
After that as a photos of young and young girls with Arab characters .
<unk> of young and <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re very <unk> .
And anybody who says , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;ll give you a word in English ! ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I would call the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No ! I would call it .
I &apos;m going to follow saying the Internet .

Their creativity in language is the way .
So let &apos;s start now .
One single novel sounds could have experienced other other time .
Could we take the Arab Earth again .
But we have to know , and I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s a solution that exists , and we have the <unk> of it .
So in short , what can we do for you now ?
Let &apos;s see ... <unk> , who is <unk> ?
Please take it , even though my time has been <unk> , and please , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time
But I don &apos;t write in Arabic and Latino characters with numbers .
( Applause ) So oh &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There &apos;s no language .
I &apos;ve been working in a virtual world with a virtual language .
And it &apos;s not easy to go back from that world and <unk> .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
<unk> <unk> first his father was first to his father .
So when I was walking my daughter , I said , &quot; &quot; This is a <unk> , my <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; This is a <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
What &apos;s happening in the head of baby ?
If you look at this 30 years ago , most people , I would say this baby is irrational , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — that I don &apos;t have to account in the other person &apos;s perspective or not to make a process of <unk> .
Over the last 20 years , the science science science was completely done this theory .
In a way , we believe that the thought of this baby is like the thought of this baby &apos;s thought of <unk> .
Take an example of this .
One thing I could be thinking of this baby , which could be the thought of this baby , which could be happening in the mind , is to address what &apos;s happening in the mind of another baby .
And finally , one of the most tough things , one of the most tough things for everyone is to treat what other people think and feel .
And maybe the hardest thing is to understand that what others think and feel is not the same as what we think we think .
Anyone who &apos;s so much of the policy can say how hard it comes to do this .
We wanted to know if babies and children can understand this very complex idea about other people .
So , the question is , how can we run ?
Kids don &apos;t speak , and if we ask a three years old , we ask what you think , we &apos;re just going to be able to make a <unk> <unk> of thinking about <unk> , <unk> and things .
How can we get it ?
It turns out that secret was the broccoli .
<unk> <unk> , one of my students , and I gave the babies two dishes with food : a <unk> <unk> and another <unk> <unk> <unk> .
All of the babies , even in Berkeley , I &apos;m enjoying the <unk> and I don &apos;t like the broccoli .
( Laughter ) And then what he was doing was <unk> food &apos;s food to two dishes .
And he felt that he loved or not the <unk> .
Half of the times , it was that we would take <unk> and not the broccoli — like any baby or normal person .
But the other half , I would take a little bit of <unk> and say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , broccoli .
<unk> the broccoli . <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then I <unk> <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; I mean , they did it like you to understand the opposite of what I loved to the babies .
We did this with babies of 15 and 18 months .
So I would like you to <unk> your hand and say , &quot; Did you make a little bit ? &quot;
So , the question was , Will babies spend the babies who loved their or their own ?
The surprising one was that the babies of 18 months , that &apos;s the end of the beginning , and talking , <unk> <unk> if you would take the <unk> and the broccoli if you eat the broccoli .
On the other hand , the babies from the 15 months of <unk> <unk> to her if he looked at the broccoli , they couldn &apos;t be able to understand it .
And after <unk> during a long mouse , <unk> <unk> , what thought I would like to like the whole world .
So there &apos;s two data on this .
For one hand is that babies from 18 months , they have been <unk> this important thing of human nature : we don &apos;t all want to do the same .
It &apos;s more , you understood that you have to act to help other people to get what they would .
And more interesting , more interesting , is that babies from 15 months to do this ; which suggests that the children of 18 months have been doing this profound , which suggests that the children from 18 months of this profound thing .
So the babies know more and we learn more than we &apos;re going to get to now .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies that had been done in the last 20 years of this fact .
What if you can ask now is , why kids learning so much ?
And how can we learn how much such as a little time ?
It &apos;s saying , the first view , babies are going to look quite like .
And often , they &apos;re worse , they &apos;re worse than <unk> , because we have to take a lot of time and energy just to keep living alive .
If we look at evolution to try to look at this mystery of what we &apos;ve lost so much time to babies , it turns out that if there &apos;s a response to the answer to the babies .
If you look at different species , it &apos;s not just other <unk> like us , but it also also other <unk> , birds , even <unk> as the <unk> or the <unk> , it turns out there &apos;s a relationship between the <unk> and the relative size of the brain and intelligence .
One example of this <unk> of these birds that you can see here .
For a band , we have the <unk> of New York .
<unk> and other <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> birds , are very clever .
In certain senses , it &apos;s as clever as <unk> .
And this is a <unk> <unk> that has learned to use tools to get food .
On the other hand , we have to our domestic <unk> .
<unk> , like the ducks , <unk> and geese , are vicious like stones .
It &apos;s very good <unk> , but it &apos;s not really good , but it &apos;s not really good to do anything else .
It turns out that the babies from the <unk> of New Yorkers , the <unk> , the <unk> , is going to be the babies of the <unk> of New Yorkers , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , are going to the babies of the <unk> of New Yorkers , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the
They rely on their mommies in their mouth for the two years of life , which is a long time in the short life of a <unk> .
However , sovereign are adult in just a couple of months .
In so much , it &apos;s the reason why the <unk> are done in the <unk> of the scientific journals , whereas authenticity are going on in the pot of soup .
There &apos;s something in the long way that it seems to be related to knowledge and learning .
What do we have to have to do this ?
Some animals , like chickens , seem to <unk> to do something very well .
So introverts are very good <unk> in a particular environment .
Other creatures , like <unk> , they &apos;re not especially good , but they &apos;re very good at all , but they &apos;re very good at learning the norms of different environments .
And of course , humans , humans are very far in that distribution .
We have more big brains in our body , much more than any other animal .
<unk> smarter , more fluctuations , we can learn more , we can survive in many more environments : we have <unk> all over the planet .
And our babies and children rely on us for much more time that babies have other species .
My son has 23 .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) So even the 23 , we put the <unk> <unk> on his open mouths in his open mouths , and then the <unk> was still up to the <unk> , we put the <unk> on his open mouths .
All right , why do we look at this discussion ?
One idea is that strategy , the strategy of learning , is a very powerful way and strong <unk> in this world . But it &apos;s a big <unk> .
It turns out that until they learns everything , if it &apos;s <unk> .
It wasn &apos;t going to be good at the <unk> <unk> and to be thinking , &quot; Would you like a <unk> or a <unk> ? &quot;
It might be better to know all of that before we get <unk> .
And the way that evolution comes to this problem was , it seems to be , a division of the work .
So we have this period of time where we &apos;re totally <unk> .
We don &apos;t have to do nothing .
And then , of adults , we can take that that we &apos;ve learned about babies and children and they put it into practice for the world .
A way to think about this is that babies and kids are small are like the <unk> department and <unk> of the human species .
They &apos;re the people who are going to go back , and they &apos;re just going to go out and have good ideas , and we are the production and <unk> .
We have to take all of these ideas that we have learned from kids and <unk> in practice .
Another way of view is , instead of thinking about babies and children as adults as adults , to think of them as being in a state of developmental development , like the same species and the <unk> , but the babies would be the <unk> of the <unk> of our own adults .
If this is true , if babies are designed to learn , and this story of evolution shows us that this is , the kids are to learn , we can expect to be a lot of powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the brain &apos;s brain seems to be the computer of the most powerful learning of the planet .
However , the real computers are getting a lot .
There &apos;s to be a revolution in our form of understanding the machines .
And the whole cause of this man , the <unk> Thomas <unk> , a statistical and a mathematician <unk> in the 18th century .
Basically , we did it provided a mathematical process that would take the theory of the probability of the probability and describe the way that scientists will be able to apply things in the world .
What scientists do is <unk> a hypothesis , something that we could start .
And then we put that chance with evidence .
The evidence would change change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence
What they &apos;re doing is that they are going to be able to do it with new tests , and so we get it .
What <unk> showed was a mathematician <unk> that could do that .
And math is the basis of the best programs of learning that we have today .
Ten years ago , I would argue that babies will be doing the same .
If you want to know what &apos;s happening under these beautiful <unk> <unk> , I think it &apos;s something that &apos;s a very similar thing .
We found out in the <unk> notes .
I think babies are going to do calculations very complicated to make sure that we have <unk> and so <unk> how the world works .
Well , this is even more difficult to prove .
If we ask an adult about statistics , it might feel pretty stupid .
How is it possible that kids make statistics ?
To test this , we brought a machine that we gave the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a box that lights and sound sounds like it &apos;s filled with it some particular objects .
By using this very simple machine , in my lab , and also in other , if we &apos;ve been spending dozens of studies of research on the thing that are children learning about the world .
We &apos;re just one we &apos;ve done with <unk> <unk> , one of my students .
If you put it up this detector probably probably by thinking that the way of <unk> is put a <unk> on the detector .
But the case is that the detector work in a way so much .
If you look at a <unk> on the detector , something that doesn &apos;t take place in a principle , the detector is based on two of every three times .
We thought that if we put the <unk> up on top of them , what would it be logical , only about two of every six times .
So , the least chance you have to think is more obvious .
It looks like the strategy of <unk> the object is more than the other .
So we explain this data to the children of four years and <unk> that <unk> .
And with security , the children of four years will take the data , and we &apos;ll get the object over the detector .
There are two interesting data in this fact .
The first one , <unk> who are kids about four years ago , and the first one , <unk> who are children for four years ago , and the first one , <unk> who are children for four years ago , and the first one , <unk> who are children for four years ago , and the first one , <unk> who are children for four years ago , and the first one , <unk> who are children for four years ago , and the first one , <unk> who are children for four years ago , and the
They are learning to count ; they are learning to count .
But unconsciously they &apos;re going to do complex calculations that give them a measure of <unk> .
The second thing is interesting about it is that they &apos;re using the evidence to get to an idea , a hypothesis about the world , which seems something a little bit better .
In research that we do in the laboratory , other similar , we &apos;ve shown that these children were better able to be better to be better to the adults , given the same task .
In these projects , kids make statistics to <unk> things about the world , but scientists experience , after all , and we wanted to see if kids were too much .
It &apos;s what we usually call &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; It has a lot of interesting studies lately lately that these games are like a kind of research program shows .
<unk> one of the laboratory <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> kids who <unk> <unk> are going to work , and the red won &apos;t , with a malfunction .
So what we &apos;re going to see now is this boy <unk> five hypotheses in a time .
Audience : And so ?
Man : Just on the other side .
<unk> : Well , the first <unk> hypothesis .
Man : Nothing .
<unk> : begins to describe the <unk> .
( Video ) Child : Why do this ?
( Laughter ) Man : Don &apos;t .
<unk> : The scientists will recognize that face of <unk> .
( Laughter ) Man : Oh , it &apos;s because this has to be like this , and this has to be like this .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
Audience : So it has to be .
Man : Oh ... can &apos;t be .
( Laughter ) <unk> : Now it comes the next .
It &apos;s called the researcher that we were going to put on top of the other .
Nothing worked .
Man : Oh , it &apos;s because light only goes up to here , not until here .
So , imagine this box is electricity , but this doesn &apos;t have .
<unk> : Well , that would be the fourth one .
Audience : OK .
If you put it four <unk> .
If you put four <unk> in this , you &apos;ll take it and two to two to you , and two to two to you , and you &apos;ll take four <unk> on this , <unk> and two to two to you .
<unk> : Well , that &apos;s the chance .
This child is — it &apos;s a very <unk> child and <unk> , but <unk> found that it &apos;s a very typical child .
If you look at how kids play kids , if you &apos;re asking you to find something , what do you do is to experiment .
Very typical age of four .
Well , what do you feel like this kind of creature ?
What if you feel like one of these <unk> can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
If you look at the theory of psychologists and philosophers , a lot that babies and kids are conscious , or even though they &apos;re not conscious .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think babies and children are more aware of the adults .
This is what we know about how to do the adult .
The awareness and attention of an adult looks like a focus .
What happens in the adults is that when we decide something is important or relevant , they &apos;re paying attention .
Now , the awareness of this is what it turns out to become <unk> and intense , like the rest of us are going to do .
We also know how it happens in the brain .
When we can pay attention to something , the frontal part of the brain , the part of the brain , the part of the brain that makes a little part of the brain if you &apos;re <unk> , if you look more like a little part of the brain if you &apos;re going to get more <unk> , better to learn ; and all of the activity in the rest of the brain .
We have this <unk> <unk> , right now .
If you look at babies and kids , you see something very different .
I think babies and kids seem to have a more <unk> of a torch than a <unk> .
We spend babies and kids spend a lot of concerned about attention to one thing .
But it would take a lot of it to take care of a lot of information in a very time .
And if you look at your brains , what you see is that they &apos;re <unk> from <unk> that we &apos;re going to get to learning and plasticity , and that it doesn &apos;t get the cable .
So when we say babies that babies and kids have problems to pay attention , what really means is they &apos;re not paying attention .
<unk> <unk> of the interesting things you might have to say something about it is important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness we need to expect from these <unk> that are going to be able to learn .
If we want to think of a way to feel that kind of infant awareness as adults , I think the best way is to think about cases we are before a new situation in which we didn &apos;t have never been before ; every time we &apos;re going to find somebody , or when we go to a city for the first time .
<unk> cases is not <unk> , but it &apos;s expanding , because it turns out that in three days in Paris , there &apos;s more awareness and experiences that every month back in the house , walking up , speaking , going on .
So for some coffee , that magnificent coffee that we take below , actually increase the effect of the <unk> of babies .
So how is a baby ?
It &apos;s like to be boyfriend in Paris , for the first time , after <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) A wonderful feeling , but that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the morning . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s an adult .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about the <unk> that are the babies .
It &apos;s an adult .
We can do things like <unk> .
And it has sense that we pretend a lot of effort to do that babies think as adults .
But if what we want is to be like these <unk> , having the open mind , is to be open to learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , innovation , innovation , maybe at least as the adults think a little bit like kids .

I &apos;m here to share my picture .
This is photograph ?
Because of course , this is a picture that can &apos;t take place with their cameras .
With all , my interest in picture began when I was going to <unk> my first tiny camera at the 15 years .
<unk> with my previous passion and the print , it was a little bit different , because by using the process of the process was more well in the planning .
And when you look at a picture of a photo with a camera , the process finishes when you get the <unk> .
To me , I had more to look more than to be in the <unk> place , in the <unk> moment .
I &apos;ll argue that anyone could do .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process would take off the <unk> .
<unk> like this : a whole building on a very <unk> road .
But it has an unexpected gyrus .
And despite this , it keeps a level of realism .
Or photos like this — dark and colorful , but all of the common objective of keeping the level of realism .
When I &apos;m saying , I &apos;m sorry .
Because of course , it &apos;s not something that can actually be captured but I always want to look like it was captured in some way as a picture .
And I &apos;ll tell you what one will have to think a moment to discover the trick .
So this thing has more to see with capturing a thought that we really can .
But what is the trick that does real look like ?
You have to see the details or the colors ?
You have to see the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
And the point of view is the illusion .
But at the end of our way of interpreting the world &apos;s way to interpret the world and how it can be <unk> on a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s really not is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
So I think the basics are very easy .
Now , I would like you as a <unk> of reality in which we take different pieces of reality and <unk> to create an alternative reality .
Let me show you an example .
So here we have three physical objects , <unk> , something that we all relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
But combined in a way you can create something that &apos;s still three-dimensional — as if you &apos;re going to be there .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t exist .
So let &apos;s take it into our brain because the brain doesn &apos;t surprise the fact that it has really no sense .
And I see the same process by combining photos .
It &apos;s really about combining different realities .
So the things that make a picture seems to realistic realistic realistic realistic realistic , I think they are the ones that we don &apos;t even think — the things that we don &apos;t even think about it .
But when we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to have to account this . Because of the reverse <unk> .
So I &apos;d like to say that there &apos;s three simple approaches that we went to an <unk> results .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But combined , you can create something like this .
So the first <unk> is that the photos combined with the same perspective .
Secondly , the photos combined with the same kind of light .
And these two images together <unk> with these requirements ; they &apos;ve got them at the same time and the same type of light .
The third point is to make it worthwhile to tell where they start and do the different imagery with a perfect <unk> .
It has to be impossible to say how to <unk> the picture in reality .
It &apos;s called the color of color , the contrast and the <unk> in the <unk> that there is between the different images , by allowing them to <unk> <unk> as long as the field of the field , and it looks like a single picture , despite the fact that a single picture actually could have hundreds of layers .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) Now , I would argue that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom part is what &apos;s manipulated .
But this picture is completely written by photos of different places .
I think it &apos;s easier to create a place that <unk> , because one doesn &apos;t need to compromise the ideas that have in the head .
But this requires a lot of planning .
And as I thought this idea in winter , I knew I had several months to design , to find different places for the bits of the <unk> .
For example , the fish was captured on an end of the catch .
The back is a different shot .
The <unk> part was taken in a stone <unk> .
And yeah , even I &apos;ve done the house of the <unk> of the island to <unk> <unk> .
So for a result , you can actually realistic realistic .
You always start with a <unk> , an idea .
So we &apos;ve got the different photos .
And there &apos;s a piece of a piece of <unk> .
If a good thing has a good job to take the photos the result can be very beautiful , and again .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that &apos;s is is our imagination .
Thank you .
