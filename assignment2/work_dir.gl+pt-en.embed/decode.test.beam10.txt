It was a fall afternoon in 2005 .
<unk> of the scientific <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> my job , but precisely that day would be a <unk> <unk> .
So let me fast-forward to me from my fellow Chris Lab .
Chris took over 30 years working on <unk> , which knew how much of the institutions work .
I told Chris I felt a bit <unk> .
I was <unk> a number of questions about the crossovers of science and freedoms <unk> : very interesting .
But I wanted to tell you that I was going to get rid of these things more to face a difference .
( Applause ) Chris , let &apos;s go straight to the big , and it turns out , all of those issues , what are the ones you have ?
&quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the world of genetic discrimination , the <unk> technologies , the <unk> and ...
<unk> , there &apos;s a great thing , the job of the <unk> as a detector .
Well , of course , the subject of genetic patents .
Yes , that &apos;s a lot of human genes .
&quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; Did you remember saying that the U.S. <unk> troll of the human body ?
It can &apos;t be . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It can &apos;t be .
And 20 minutes later , he came up to him <unk> .
&quot; &quot; <unk> ! You had a reason ! What do you do ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And this is a big lawyer , but I didn &apos;t know almost nothing about <unk> <unk> and absolutely nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> , much less <unk> troll .
Now , of course , there was a lot of learning before I had to learn before I had no one .
First of all , we had to know exactly what &apos;s going on when somebody <unk> a gene .
<unk> in genetic troll to make dozens of <unk> , but the tallest ones of all are called &quot; &quot; DNA <unk> , &quot; &quot; or it &apos;s a piece of DNA that &apos;s a <unk> .
The ability to say , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t reveal the genes of your body in your body , get the genes . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true , the most insidious problem in which it is necessary for us .
And the patents didn &apos;t tell us a particular gene gene , but all the reliable versions of that gene .
What mean this ?
Well , yeah , you can &apos;t pass your genes a doctor and <unk> them , to see if you find mutations , without the permission of the <unk> .
It also means that the <unk> of the patent has is the right to prevent that gene in research or clinical trials .
<unk> that these <unk> , the kid companies , <unk> parts of the human genome was <unk> the patients .
We have the case of <unk> , a small of 10 years with <unk> syndrome , a heart disease , that if it &apos;s not about it , can cure death .
The company that <unk> the two genes associated with this disease is going to be able to diagnose the syndrome .
But then it came into <unk> and never came to <unk> .
But the company <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
A couple of years is not able to do it .
During that time , <unk> died of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> used to be a problem that <unk> the patients .
Do we have any way to get out of front ?
Well , it turns out that the Supreme Court stopped in a long list of cases , there are a number of things that are not <unk> .
You can &apos;t get <unk> products of nature : the air , the water , the <unk> , the elements of the <unk> .
Not the laws of nature : the law of gravity , and = <unk> .
It &apos;s very fundamental , and you have to be able to be able to be able to reach out of each other .
In our view DNA , the structure of the most fundamental life structure , that encode the production of all of our proteins , is so much a product of nature as a law of nature , regardless of that if we take our bodies or at the bottom of a <unk> .
To find better , <unk> around the country to talk to various specialists : scientists , doctors , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers .
Most of us would argue that we had a reason from a political view of a political view , and when less of the theory of a legal view .
All of them thought the chance of going to go through our subject were so many as a scratch .
But why ?
It turns out that the patent troll leads to over 20 years .
I mean , there were thousands of patents humans .
The patent court was very <unk> on the status quo industry , the biotech industry around this practice , and the whole laws of <unk> the <unk> <unk> year after year after Congress , without never going to ever before .
In short , the courts won &apos;t be willing to be willing to <unk> these patents .
But I don &apos;t like Chris , and I &apos;m not sure it was afraid of me , and he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s probably not enough , &quot; &quot; it will be more <unk> to follow fighting .
So we started to recognize our cause .
<unk> by troll would be : <unk> demand demand for some <unk> , dark , messy , messy .
We don &apos;t have <unk> that kind of causes of the causes of causes , we think of our cause much more .
<unk> of the scientific freedom , the doctor and the rights of the patients .
So we decided to open a cause that would not be like the norm that there &apos;s a lot of patents , but a causes of the rights of <unk> .
We &apos;re going to identify a <unk> of genetic troll that was going to advocate for their patents to then organize a <unk> <unk> and experts who would spread the courts as these patents to the patient like these patents over patients and innovation .
We think the ideal candidate for <unk> was <unk> <unk> , a company in Salt Lake Affairs .
<unk> <unk> over two genes , the <unk> genes and the <unk> .
The women with certain mutations in these genes have more likely to get cancer from them from chest cancer .
A full <unk> on the evidence of <unk> in the United States .
They did that a lot to be able to get rid of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There would be a lot of money in his examination , over 3,000 dollars .
I want to share their clinical data with the international scientific community .
And , if it &apos;s the worst of all , for a period of a couple of years ago , I &apos;m going to tell you how to make sure that we have been identified by a group of researchers in France .
It turns out that during that time , for a few years , until a 12 percent of the women who have made a wrong answer : a negative outcome that should be positive .
This is <unk> <unk> .
The author of <unk> , Eileen , developed cancer for 40 years and did exams with <unk> .
The scan had negative .
The family <unk> .
The most likely was that cancer was not in the family in the family , so the other family members didn &apos;t need to do .
But two years later , <unk> <unk> is a <unk> cancer system .
And it turns out that the late <unk> <unk> between that 12 percent of people who received a false outcome .
If Gneezy <unk> the outcome , it would be able to be the exam , and would prevent their cancer from <unk> .
They could take these problems .
<unk> genetic modification , <unk> genetic system , <unk> organizations in defense of defense , four organizations , and the individual women who or they couldn &apos;t afford the <unk> <unk> , or they also had a second opinion that we couldn &apos;t afford to pay for the <unk> , or so they couldn &apos;t afford to pay the <unk> .
One of the main challenges we &apos;re faced when we prepare this case was to think about science .
So to argue that what I &apos;ve done is not a job , and that the genes are <unk> <unk> were products , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , from the guy : What is a gene ? What is the DNA ?
How if the DNA of DNA , and why is it ?
We spend hours of hours and hours of our <unk> and experts , trying to give them the way to explain these concepts in the most simpler way .
And at the end end , you end up your hand and your hand , like the gold .
So <unk> DNA is like to extract gold from a <unk> or a river .
You can see the process to extract gold , but you can &apos;t afford the gold .
So much of the way I &apos;m working on to extract the gold of the mountain ; you can &apos;t afford it .
And the gold , once , you can do it in all sorts of things in what you couldn &apos;t use when I was on the mountain ; it &apos;s going to make it <unk> , for example , but you can &apos;t afford the gold , for example , because it &apos;s an gold .
In 2009 , we were ready to make that case .
I was in front of the Federal <unk> of New York City in New York , and the case <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In the case of 2010 , the judge was issued his <unk> <unk> : <unk> pages .
When you read his opinion , I &apos;m going to tell you what I described in the case .
I mean , our report — was quite good , but not so good .
How could we develop such a profound understanding of the subject ?
We can &apos;t even imagine how it was possible .
So it turned out , he turned out that he was working with the judge in that , not just a lawyer was scientific .
And it wasn &apos;t just scientific , I had a PhD in biology in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) Wow .
So we called <unk> called the <unk> of the Federal Reserve .
And here the things you do interesting .
First , in a life point that , the government of the United States has changed from side .
In the court court , government issued a report to <unk> <unk> .
But in the direct <unk> to its own cooking degrees , the government would have a report where we would take this subject to the light of the brave court of the district of the district , and then <unk> DNA <unk> wasn &apos;t supposed to be <unk> .
This was very important , and totally unexpected .
The <unk> <unk> of the Federal <unk> leads all of the patents , and it &apos;s called his <unk> very , very high <unk> .
So even with this event , <unk> <unk> .
And so it was .
More or less .
The decision was about two .
But the two <unk> who voted voted against us , made it completely different .
The first one , the judge would lead to their own and new theory theory , totally wrong .
( Laughter )
We had never imagined that , so I had no sense .
The other judge , Moore &apos;s Law , said that we would have to be the DNA to be a product of nature .
But I don &apos;t want to <unk> the biotech industry .
You have to make a question that we have to make a question that you want to respond .
In general , these questions would take the shape of a paragraph in a <unk> , a kid with a lot of <unk> , where it is , &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; so . &quot;
We &apos;ve done that is the shortest question that we &apos;ve never received .
Five words : Is that human genes ?
When Chris asked me what I thought about these words , I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
I think I would say , &quot; &quot; Is the DNA <unk> ? &quot; &quot; &quot; No .
I want to tell you how the same reaction is that I &apos;ve been talking about this topic seven years .
The Supreme Court continued to us around one percent of the cases that we found , and we &apos;ll hear our own .
It &apos;s the day of Scotland , and it was very , very exciting — with a lot of people outside , people who went to school since 2 : 30 of the morning to try to get into the <unk> .
Two organizations in the chest of chest cancer , and a few years ago , I found a <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Chris and I <unk> together in the hallway , moments before he <unk> to defend the most important case of his career .
I was much more than he .
But all of that panic to me when I got in the room , and I saw my whole bunch of sacrifices , and I saw my whole bunch of sacrifices known as women who knew that he had been a lot of time from their own careers in <unk> to this fight , representatives that would have been a lot of time from their own careers , representatives that would have been a lot of time from their own careers in the court that would have been working on to the court .
In the room , they were also three leaders of the Human Genome Project called , <unk> Watson , the <unk> of the DNA , James Watson , who had a report to the court of the court , when he said to the genes was a &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the diversity of communities represented in the room and <unk> that every single day we had in play .
<unk> was <unk> .
Chris claimed .
But for me , the most exciting one was to see the <unk> of the Supreme Court , trying to understand the DNA <unk> , through a series of <unk> <unk> and dialogues in the very similar way as it made our legal team for the last seven years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> to the DNA of DNA with a <unk> plant .
The judge was <unk> by making a baseball baseball from a tree .
And in the case of the doubt was my favorite moment , the <unk> <unk> that the <unk> DNA was <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) When we left that day from <unk> <unk> , I had never seen the outcome : nine .
A natural segment of DNA is a product of nature that &apos;s a product of nature , and it &apos;s not clear about it .
And what &apos;s more , it has nothing to do nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , four hours after the decision , five hours after the decision , five labs I &apos;ve had to <unk> the test for the genes .
Some of them have <unk> <unk> exams at the most cheap exams .
Some <unk> <unk> a <unk> examination , which <unk> <unk> .
But the decision of the court was in addition to <unk> .
It &apos;s going to happen with a lot of 25 years ago that we would have provided human genes in the United States .
<unk> <unk> that paints the innovation and the biomedical research .
And they helped make a patient like <unk> , <unk> and Eileen had access to exams they needed .
A few weeks later that the court was a little package in a few weeks later that the court was his decision , and I got a little package in the box of email .
It was from Bob <unk> , a teacher from Duke University and one of the first people , and Chris went to visit , a teacher from Duke University and one of the first people , and Chris went to Bob <unk> , a teacher from Duke University and one of the first people , and Chris went to <unk> , a teacher from Duke University and one of the first people , and Chris went to Bob <unk> , a teacher from Duke University and one of the first people , and Chris went to <unk> , a
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a lot of this case .
Part of what the bravery of dealing with those risks was knowing that we were doing the right thing .
And the process was almost eight years since the beginning , with a lot of <unk> and <unk> by the way .
Of course , they helped , but we &apos;ve been the communities that <unk> , and the <unk> we &apos;ve created , the ones that have given us .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Hi . Today , let me show you a <unk> of eight of my projects , made me with the artist &apos;s artist <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> &amp; <unk> &amp; <unk> and we live in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The phone says . &quot; &quot; It was in the peculiar habit of my uncle in constantly <unk> that he did something for him , almost like me , almost like me , like I was an extension of his body : the lights , or <unk> a glass plant .
When I grew up , the thing was the worse and surprised me to see how a way of control .
And of course , I couldn &apos;t say nothing , because it &apos;s a very <unk> figure in the family <unk> .
What I &apos;m more <unk> and <unk> was his use .
El <unk> <unk> , and he told me the number for him .
In the answer and how to gift for my guy said , &quot; &quot; The phone said . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so much that they &apos;re missing two people to use .
It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle is using a phone phone to a person .
The problem is , when you walk away from home and I went to university , I started using less .
So I made a machine writing machine with what he could give their commands to <unk> and <unk> around the world by emails .
What I had to do was take a paper , put paper in the car , write email , and turning the paper .
This device allows you to automatically automatically the person in a matter of email .
You see , you can see that there &apos;s a lot of electronic devices that understand all of the <unk> and <unk> in digital .
So my uncle is just about an mechanical interface .
And since then , the object has to be awesome and having a touch of <unk> , like I like my uncle .
The next job is a <unk> device that we call <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we wanted to work with the <unk> of being surrounded by a <unk> , sensitive and sweet .
This works like this . We have these <unk> here on the wall , and behind , we have these little creatures that have <unk> .
In the corner in silence , <unk> .
And if there &apos;s more silence , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
And at the end , it &apos;s a new thing .
So we have these <unk> in three walls of a room .
And we had a 500 of these little <unk> <unk> behind .
And that &apos;s how it works .
This is a video study .
So when there &apos;s silence , move from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , when there &apos;s silence .
We don &apos;t know how humans or the real creatures .
And I &apos;m going to tell you the sounds that the <unk> was going on .
It &apos;s not true .
<unk> a train in a moment when it doesn &apos;t hurt .
( noise ) But it scares the sounds on the first plan . <unk> that one second .
( Laughter ) We work hard to do the most realistic .
Each <unk> has its own behavior , the psyche , changes of humor , personalities , etc .
This is a very premature prototype .
And of course , it was the best after that .
We had to give people the people , but we &apos;ve seen that people were quite <unk> and child with them .
This is a video device called &quot; &quot; The thoughtless person . &quot; &quot; So we were quite intrigued with the idea of playing invisibility .
How would it be possible to experience invisibility ?
We worked with a <unk> company in <unk> cameras , and we asked them to have a software with us using a camera that could look at people in the room , follow these people and take a person on the bottom , find invisible .
I &apos;m going to show you a very premature prototype .
In the right side , you can see my colleague <unk> , which is in space .
And on the left , you &apos;ll see the video video that the camera makes invisible .
It turns out in the room . Wow ! <unk> invisible .
You can see how the camera follow and the <unk> .
It &apos;s a premature video , because it &apos;s still not <unk> the <unk> and all of that , but it turns out that it turns out .
This was a room in a room where a camera looking at space and we had a monitor in every wall .
And second people kept in the room , <unk> themselves in the ground , except for a distinction : a person was constantly invisible where they want to be in the room .
This work is called &quot; &quot; The <unk> of the sun . &quot; &quot; It was almost like a piece of paper , like a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> or a sun .
So in front , this object seemed to be very strong and robust , almost seemed very weak .
People would walk around the room and almost the <unk> thinking that was any <unk> .
But in the corner , I &apos;m going to make it up , put it into the wall in the dead .
<unk> and <unk> .
( Laughter ) This job is a <unk> pasting .
His head is so heavy , full of thoughts , which seems that it falls into their <unk> and his bodies grows away from a plant .
What it does is to move around from his head as if he had passed away in a very concise motion , and it was slow .
It &apos;s like so much that circle .
Because if that circle wasn &apos;t there , and the soil outside the ground is very ground , <unk> to <unk> through space .
And they &apos;re not there .
Take an example , when people comes in in the room , there &apos;s an object .
And then , very slowly , in a few minutes , it gets frustrated , takes the speed and look like it &apos;s the point of falling .
This is a important moment because we wanted a <unk> in a way of almost going and help or save the subject .
But you don &apos;t need it because it &apos;s even the other time .
This work was a <unk> challenge for us and we work very hard , like in most of our jobs , for years to get a mechanical , a balance , a balance .
It was very important for us to be able to establish the exact moment in which we were <unk> , because if we were doing it in the way that we move the balance , then we would not have enough that <unk> , or that effect of wanting to go to help .
I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we do a test . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my fellow . I &apos;m going to go .
Now it &apos;s going to nervous , so it &apos;s going to take it .
But you don &apos;t need to do it , because it &apos;s going to be it .
This is a job with what we &apos;ve been very excited about with the fastest-growing of the skin <unk> with thousands of tons of <unk> fiber <unk> , which would be like the night sky .
And it &apos;s the scale of the night sky .
This is about a drop in a drop of <unk> <unk> , which was <unk> .
And the idea was that cold , very cold and abstract , like the universe with a head of a <unk> bear , which is a lot more comforting and intimate .
And the idea was that I &apos;m sitting there to look at the way of a bear <unk> and almost <unk> as a hole in space , as if you &apos;re going to see a brilliant night .
This is the last job , still in process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> of space . &quot; &quot; Imagine a little bit like this in the middle of the room in the middle of the room , and there &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> <unk> on a cube twice and four times its volume .
This object is in <unk> and <unk> to create a lot of people in <unk> <unk> , like if you could afford to hide a secret in their body or something like this .
We work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t don &apos;t like , because we don &apos;t like a lot of suffering in our work for years and years .
But we use it because we are interested in the way that helps understanding emotions and patterns of behavior in these creatures that we create .
When a creature comes out of the mind , and it &apos;s almost like the creation process is discovering the way this creature wants to exist , that way they want to take and like if you want to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to begin to start a useful trick not technology , and all the way requires of you is this : it &apos;s <unk> for two minutes .
But before I <unk> myself , I want to convince you now that if you take your body and what you &apos;re doing with it .
See , how many of you are in the same way ?
<unk> , with her <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Sometimes you put your arms .
Sometimes it <unk> . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll tell you .
<unk> attention to what we do right now .
We &apos;re going to go back to this one in a few minutes , and I hope you &apos;re going to get a little bit going to change the development of your life .
Well , we are <unk> with body language and <unk> language language .
You know , <unk> — this , so — ( Laughter ) A interaction , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , or even something like a hands of hands .
Narrator : So here &apos;s the number 10 .
This cop gets lucky and open the hand to the president of the United States .
There comes the first minister — no . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy . ( Applause ) Amy <unk> : A <unk> of hands , or his <unk> , can us tell us that I &apos;m going to talk for weeks and weeks .
And even the BBC and the New York Times .
So when we think about verbal expression or language or body language , we know don &apos;t verbal confidence . We talk about language .
When we talk about communication we think in interactions .
What about your body language ?
What do you talk to me ?
There &apos;s reason to believe that this is true .
Sociologists at a lot of time we spend a lot of time in the world , or of other people , about the <unk> .
We do <unk> and <unk> language language .
These <unk> can predict how important <unk> is important in their lives as likely to <unk> or travelers or who we are asking a quote .
For example , <unk> <unk> , researcher at the University of <unk> , demonstrates that when somebody sees 30 seconds of old interactions with no real interactions of the medical doctor , if that doctor &apos;s going to be <unk> or not .
So you don &apos;t have to see so much if the doctor was or not , but you don &apos;t want to do it as if you liked it .
But even more <unk> , Alex <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> candidates in a second , 70 percent of the result of the career and the Senate in the United States and even , in the digital <unk> , <unk> <unk> in line can lead to more value in line .
If you do a bad use of them is bad idea , right ?
Much more verbal language is to talk about how to each other , like us and what the consequences are .
But we tend to forget the other audience in which it impacts our language doesn &apos;t verbal , that we are ourselves .
<unk> our language doesn &apos;t verbal , our thoughts , feelings and physiology .
How much language I &apos;m talking about ?
They &apos;re a <unk> social and I study the <unk> and I have to care about a business school of business , so it was inevitable that the dynamics of the power dynamics .
It tells me about all the odds you don &apos;t care of power and <unk> .
What are the odds aren &apos;t prevalent power and <unk> ?
Well , it &apos;s this .
In the animal kingdom , you have to look at the expansion , and in the animal kingdom you have to see with the expansion .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , basically <unk> .
It &apos;s about <unk> .
And it works like this in all the animal kingdom , and it works like this .
It &apos;s not just the <unk> .
Humans do the same thing . ( Laughter ) They have that same . ( Laughter ) They have a permanent system and also when they feel powerful at the moment .
This is especially interesting because it tells us the ancient and universal values that are the ability of power .
This expression , called it as he was , was studied by Jessica <unk> .
It tells us that so much people that tell us that so much the people that you see since they were born , the people that are blind to do the same as they make a physical competition .
So when you take the goal of the goal of the goal and they win it doesn &apos;t matter if they &apos;ve never seen it .
They have this .
The arms would be called by rockets , <unk> .
What do we do when we feel helpless ?
We do just do the opposite .
<unk> . <unk> .
<unk> little .
We don &apos;t want to worry about who is our next .
And so animals like humans do the same .
And this is what happens when we want to work with helplessness .
What we tend to do when it comes to power is <unk> language or verbal language .
So if somebody look very powerful with us , we tend to get more small .
We do the opposite .
If I see this behavior in the class , what would you do ?
It reminds me that the student of MBA has all the language doesn &apos;t verbal verbal language .
There are people who are <unk> <unk> in the classroom , they come in the middle of the same before the class , like <unk> into space .
When she sat , they seem .
<unk> your hand .
And then there &apos;s other people that come up with <unk> .
He was in his face , and in his body , I sat down in the chair and continue it , and they &apos;re doing it , and they &apos;re doing so when it comes to hand .
Here &apos;s two things .
One won &apos;t be <unk> .
You &apos;ll have to see with sex .
Women are more likely to do it that men .
Women always remain less powerful than men , so this isn &apos;t surprising .
But the other thing I &apos;ve noticed is it seems to be connected to the stage of the students of the students and their level of them .
And this is very important in the case of MBA , because the math counts for the media .
The business schools have been fighting with the difference between the <unk> .
They found women and men equally <unk> and then look at these differences in the notes , who would be <unk> in part of the top .
So I started asking myself , if there are people who come from that attitude and <unk> , and then I started asking myself , if there are people who come to that attitude and <unk> , and then I started asking myself , if there are people who come to that attitude and <unk> , and then I started asking myself , if there are people who come to that attitude and <unk> , and then I started asking myself , if there are people who come to that attitude and <unk> .
Could it be possible to do that , it would be possible to do that , and that &apos;s going to participate more ?
My collaborator <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s in Berkeley , and I wanted to know if you can get it to it .
I mean , can you just do it just for a moment and try a result in your behavior that makes you feel more powerful ?
We know that language doesn &apos;t tell verbal language that other people feel and they think of us . There &apos;s a lot of evidence .
But our question was : Do we eat language doesn &apos;t trust what we feel and think of ourselves ?
There &apos;s some evidence that this is .
For example , you smile when you &apos;re happy , but you &apos;re also going to give you a foot away with your shoulder .
It works in two <unk> .
When it comes to power , it &apos;s also working on two <unk> .
When we feel powerful it is more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when it &apos;s going to be powerful is more likely to actually feel powerful .
Well , the second question was , well , we know , well , we already know that the head of our body is our body , but it &apos;s true that the body has changed our mind ?
And when I say , in the case of the powerful words , I &apos;m talking about it ?
Well , I mean , and feelings and feelings of <unk> that make these thoughts and feelings and feelings and in my case , talk about hormones .
How is the mind of powerful compared to what they &apos;re not ?
The powerful people tend to be , it &apos;s not surprising , more <unk> and secure , more optimistic .
They have the feeling that they &apos;re win in <unk> games .
We also tend to think of a more abstract way .
And there are a lot of differences . It &apos;s more risks .
There &apos;s a lot of other differences among the powerful ones and the ones that are not .
It &apos;s also also a difference in two key hormones : the testosterone , which is the hormone <unk> , and the <unk> , which is the hormone of stress .
The males have gotten a lot of power in the <unk> of <unk> , they have high high levels of testosterone and high levels of <unk> , and the powerful leaders and the effective leaders and the efficient leaders of <unk> .
What does this mean ? When I talk about power , I &apos;m going to tell you just about the testosterone .
But the power also has to see with our reaction to stress .
We want a dominant leader , with a lot of power , with high levels of testosterone , but by the stress ?
It probably doesn &apos;t , right ?
We want a person who are powerful , <unk> and dominant , but not so sensitive to the stress , a person who &apos;s quiet .
We know that in <unk> <unk> , if you have to take control , if somebody has to take control , if somebody has to take control , take suddenly that paper , in the middle of a days of days , its testosterone would have a lot of them and <unk> them equally .
We have that evidence , that body can take the mind , at least the x level , and also the paper <unk> can get the mind .
So what happens when you look at the paper change ? What happens if you take a minimum level , like this little <unk> or <unk> ?
He said , &quot; &quot; I want it for two minutes to me , &quot; &quot; I want you to get more powerful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what we did .
We decided to bring people to the lab and do a little experiment , these people <unk> , for two minutes , both of them , both of them , both of them , both <unk> , and I &apos;m going to show you right now now five of these <unk> , even though they ate just two .
This is one .
A couple of more , a couple of more a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple , a couple of more a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple , a couple of more a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple , a couple of more a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple , a couple of more a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple , a couple of more a couple of a couple of a couple of a
The press was called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; .
Here we have a couple more .
You can be standing , or sitting .
Here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
Now , let &apos;s go small little .
This is very low power .
When I was <unk> <unk> <unk> , really .
This is what happens .
They come in , <unk> in a jar , and <unk> for two minutes , you have to do this or that . &quot; &quot; They won &apos;t see the photos of the <unk> .
We don &apos;t want to <unk> with a concept of power .
We want them feel the power .
They have this two minutes .
And then it <unk> , &quot; &quot; how powerful you feel ? &quot; &quot; then he <unk> the chance to bet , the end we take another shows .
That &apos;s all . This is all the experiment .
This is what we found .
<unk> at the risk , the bet ; we found that when they are in a high sense of <unk> , the 86 percent .
When they &apos;re in <unk> , it &apos;s only 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant distinction .
Let &apos;s see what we found with testosterone .
It &apos;s about his normal situation by getting out of their normal situation to get an increased increase of the 20 percent and the <unk> that will take rid of the 10 percent .
Again , two minutes , and we take those changes .
Now the results with <unk> .
The most powerful one is a 25 percent of decrease , the more we &apos;ve been around the 15 percent of it around the 15 percent .
There &apos;s just two minutes of these these hormonal changes that <unk> your brain to make it safe , safe or <unk> , or a lot of <unk> with your stress , and it &apos;s messy .
We all know that feeling , right ?
It turns out that our language doesn &apos;t secure their own verbal way to ourselves , not just too much .
The body can tell you the mind .
So the next question , of course , is — can a gesture of power in a study of a significant way ?
This is the laboratory , this experiment , just two minutes .
Where can you really apply this ?
That &apos;s what you care about .
We think where you need to be in the <unk> in the <unk> , like the social <unk> , you know , as opposed to the social media .
( Laughter ) But when you hear your friends .
For teens is in the room table .
For some people &apos;s talking about the school .
It may be like a business or giving a talk like this or going to a job interview .
It &apos;s going to be one of the most people that include the majority of the people , because many of them are going to work .
So we asked the results , the press <unk> and said , well , this is what you have to do when you go to an interview , right ?
( Laughter ) Of course , there would be <unk> and said , no , for God , not not what we wanted to say .
For a lot of reason , don &apos;t do that .
Again , it &apos;s not about the other people .
It &apos;s about to talk to you .
What do you do before go to a job interview ?
You &apos;re sitting . <unk> your iPhone ... or your Android , we won &apos;t let anybody outside .
Hold on your text messages , you &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , when you &apos;re going to be doing it , it &apos;s going to be doing it in the <unk> , right ? He <unk> two minutes .
So that &apos;s what we want to grade , right ?
<unk> people in the lab , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then it &apos;s going to be able to be able to get a job interview by <unk> <unk> .
After five minutes of <unk> .
It &apos;s also <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> to don &apos;t offer verbal <unk> .
Imagine that this person interview .
Over five minutes , nothing is worse than you <unk> .
People like this .
It &apos;s what Marianne &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; This is the <unk> .
This is the interview to the <unk> that <unk> , because we wanted to see what we did .
We have analysts at the <unk> , four in total .
They didn &apos;t know the chance . Don &apos;t know the conditions .
They don &apos;t have any idea that he has had a position that he took every person and the end of looking at all the things , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , &quot; &quot; all the <unk> of power .
We don &apos;t want to hire <unk> .
<unk> a lot more positive in general . &quot; &quot; What was happening ?
It &apos;s not about the production of speech .
It &apos;s about the presence that tells us to the speech .
Why do you evaluate them in all of these <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
Will it happen ? What ratings do you do ?
These things don &apos;t affect . This is what it affects .
This kind of things .
Every person would get himself , basically .
<unk> what they are .
<unk> their ideas , for themselves , without any extra .
So this is what it causes or <unk> the effect .
When I talk to people about this , that our bodies change our mind and behavior can change our minds of being , and it &apos;s going to change our way to be , and do it ?
I <unk> : <unk> until it .
I &apos;m not like this .
I don &apos;t want to get there and <unk> it like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to <unk> like a <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to get there to feel that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
This is very important for me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an apple and something like I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
When I was 19 , he was a terrible accident of car .
I was walking away from it , and I found a lot of <unk> .
I was visiting my car .
<unk> in intensive care unit in the head of the head , and I was told that my <unk> <unk> two standard <unk> . It was very traumatic .
<unk> my <unk> , because I &apos;m <unk> as <unk> , and <unk> girl .
So I stopped university and tried to go back .
He said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t end my career .
You have to embrace that there &apos;s other things you can do , but in your case this doesn &apos;t . &quot; &quot; I had to deal with that , and I have to say that I &apos;m going to give you your identity , what you really are , who you &apos;re going to give you your identity , what you &apos;re going to do .
It was completely helpless .
And then I worked and worked , and I had <unk> and I was lucky , and I worked .
Finally <unk> in university .
<unk> four years later in my classmates , and I &apos;m going to convince somebody , my <unk> <unk> , Susan <unk> , to me , and I felt like I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
The night before the first course of the first course , is the first course of the first course of the first course .
It &apos;s like .
She was so afraid of the worm Elvis the next day I was saying , and I said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t let me leave . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to leave anything , because I look back for you and go stay .
You &apos;ll go back , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
They &apos;re going to do all the exhibitions that they eat .
It &apos;s just going to do it , and make it , and it &apos;s going to take away that you &apos;re frightened or even paralyzed and having a experienced experience , until you look at the moment , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
I got there . I &apos;m doing it now . And that &apos;s what I did .
Five years ago , a few years old , a few years , you know , in <unk> , I &apos;m not thinking about it , but for a lot of time I don &apos;t think about it , but for a long time I had the feeling that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
The end of my first year in Harvard , a student who didn &apos;t work in the class at all the semester , when he <unk> , &quot; &quot; Look , you have to participate , you &apos;re going to be going to hit me . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know it .
<unk> <unk> , he said , &quot; &quot; I should be there . &quot;
That was my moment .
Because there &apos;s two things .
The first one I learned : <unk> ! I don &apos;t feel it .
I didn &apos;t feel like this , but she &apos;s going to get it in his place .
The second was , of course , must be there .
So let &apos;s look at it and can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course . Yes . Yes . Yes .
It turns out , you &apos;re going to be <unk> , you &apos;re going to be powerful , and you know what — ( Applause ) You &apos;ll go to the class and go to the best narrative of everyone . &quot; &quot; And you know ? He did the best speech of everybody . &quot; &quot; And you know ? He did the best speech of all , people who were <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t even want to worry about it . &quot;
In order to <unk> .
Now I want to tell you that there &apos;s no way to do it .
You have to get it up to turn .
There &apos;s that enough enough to turn and <unk> .
The last one I &apos;m going to say is this .
<unk> change can lead to large <unk> .
It &apos;s just two minutes .
Before I came to the next situation where I was going to take you over two minutes , I would like this , in the <unk> , in the room , on the door closed .
This is what you have to do .
<unk> the brain to do the best of that situation .
<unk> testosterone . <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t think of that situation because I don &apos;t show who they are .
I remember that situation I &apos;m going to tell you who I &apos;m going to tell you who I &apos;m trying to prove it .
I want to convince you before nothing I had a position of power , and I also want to share the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My ego ego doesn &apos;t depend on this . ( Laughter ) <unk> , <unk> people , because the best can use are those without resources and technology , without power .
It &apos;s about them because they can do it in private .
They only need their body , privacy and two minutes to change the <unk> of his life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is the most big problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good option .
( Laughter ) Instead I &apos;m going to talk about what are the big problems in the world ?
( Laughter ) And I should say , before we continue to keep it every one of you who <unk> <unk> and paper because I &apos;m going to ask me to see how we do it .
So <unk> <unk> and paper .
After all , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world out there .
I &apos;m going to get just a few .
800 million people went to head .
One billion people don &apos;t have access to the water .
Two billion without sanitation .
We &apos;ve seen millions of people dying of HIV and AIDS .
<unk> lists .
Two billion people who are going to see <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> — and <unk> .
We have many , many problems outside .
In a ideal world , we all know , but we don &apos;t do it .
The truth is that we don &apos;t solve all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do it , the question I think we should do — and that &apos;s the reason why we are in the economy of the economy — is saying , if we don &apos;t do it , we really have to start asking ourselves , why should we solve first ?
That &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to love .
If you &apos;re going to say , 50 billion of <unk> to spend in the next four years to make this world , what should we spend ?
We &apos;re going to save 10 of the most large challenges of the world , and just the <unk> , the climate , <unk> , education , education , education , financial instability , <unk> , <unk> movements , sanitation and water , <unk> movements , sanitation and water and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls
We think these are a lot of ways , <unk> the greatest problems in the world .
The question would be <unk> , what do you think are the greatest ?
Why should we begin to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s asking for a good problem , but that &apos;s asking for a problem .
In fact , that was the <unk> of what was talked about in Davos .
But it turns out , there &apos;s a problem if you &apos;re giving them to the people who are in the problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
There &apos;s certainly the greatest problems we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to solve that , we have ?
So the thing is not just <unk> the problems , but we &apos;ll give the solutions to the problems .
And it would be — naturally it &apos;s a little more complicated .
To <unk> , it would be something like <unk> .
To <unk> disease , they could be clinics or networks for mosquitos .
To <unk> , they would be the forces of the U.N. , and we could continue .
What I &apos;d like to make sure I was going to do , and that in 30 seconds — and I know that kind of a way is something impossible — <unk> what you think are the priorities of the priorities .
And it &apos;s also — in this is , naturally , where the economy is going to go through — <unk> what we didn &apos;t have to do .
What should I be the end of the list ?
Please , <unk> just 30 seconds , perhaps <unk> with people <unk> , and just imagine who should be the primary priorities and the less <unk> of the solutions that we have for the greatest problems in the world .
The surprising of this process — of course , I mean , I &apos;m just going to say , I &apos;m just 18 minutes ago — I &apos;m just a important piece of my time .
I &apos;d like to <unk> , and I &apos;m going to think about this process , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
And they also recommend it enormously , and I &apos;m sure that we &apos;re also going to have these <unk> , then to think , how do we really do it ?
Since then , there &apos;s if we ask the same , why never have made a list like this before ?
And one reason is that <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
Nobody wants to do .
And of course , all of the organizations will be in the tallest of a list like that .
But also all the <unk> will not be in the higher .
And if there &apos;s a lot more , don &apos;t don &apos;t have any <unk> numbers , you don &apos;t want a list like this .
So 60 years ago there is the U.N. , and it &apos;s still not a basic list of the big things we can do in the world , and said , what would we do first ?
This doesn &apos;t mean that we &apos;re not going to <unk> — every decision is a <unk> , so that despite all of us that we &apos;re not only <unk> — and that &apos;s not sure it &apos;s just as good as if we really did it , and that &apos;s not sure that it &apos;s really good as a <unk> , and it &apos;s not likely to be done .
So what I &apos;m <unk> is really saying that we had , for a long period of time , a situation in which 3,000 options .
There are many , many things we can do there , but we didn &apos;t have the prices , and they didn &apos;t have the prices .
We didn &apos;t have an idea .
Imagine that in a restaurant and you have a huge letter , but you don &apos;t know what &apos;s the prices .
You know you have pizza , but we don &apos;t know how much it costs .
It could be a <unk> , could be 1,000 dollars .
Could it be a familiar pizza . Could it be a individual pizza , right ?
You know , you know these things .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s trying to do the <unk> <unk> — it &apos;s going to put the prices of these subjects .
And so basically , this was the process of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the best economists in the world , three of each area .
In order to take three of the best economists on the planet <unk> about <unk> .
What can we do ? What do you do ? What do you know ?
<unk> diseases .
Three of the best experts saying , we can do it ?
What will it be ?
What should we do about that , and what would it be ?
And so forth .
So we took some of the best economists in the world , eight of the greatest economists in the world , including three Danish <unk> , <unk> in May 2004 .
We call the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; The <unk> of the Cambridge <unk> decided to <unk> the Real <unk> of the economy .
<unk> works very well in Europe , but there &apos;s not so much .
And basically what they did , was actually a <unk> list .
What did you do , why economists ?
And naturally , I &apos;m so happy that I was asking me that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The subject is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , questions about malaria .
If you want to know about the climate , questions like a <unk> .
But if you want to know what the two must solve first , you can &apos;t get rid of the two of the two , because that &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what the economists do .
<unk> .
They have this <unk> thing to say , we have to do first , and we have to do first , and we have to do after .
So this is the list , and this is the list I want to share with you .
Of course , you &apos;re going to see on the Web , and I &apos;m sure you &apos;re also going to get rid of it as a day .
Basically we had a list of the list that said that there would be bad projects — basically , projects where it was a <unk> , and you &apos;ve seen less of a <unk> as a result .
And then there were the projects right , the good ones , the good ones .
And naturally projects are very good projects that we should start to do .
I &apos;m going to start from the last way that we would end up with the best projects .
These were the <unk> .
As you can see the end of the list is <unk> .
This speaks to a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things that people say should not be <unk> .
And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why ?
And the truth , I &apos;m also going to talk to me about this because it &apos;s probably one of the things we don &apos;t eat according to the lists of <unk> .
And the reason was it turned out that they said , or to do something more than <unk> — it &apos;s not a good business , because it &apos;s very inefficient .
It &apos;s not saying there &apos;s no global global warming .
It &apos;s not saying it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying what we can do for it is very little , a very high cost .
What we basically show is the media , the media of all the neuropathological models and that <unk> , if the whole world was running , <unk> over a billion cubic million <unk> .
That &apos;s an important amount of money .
Twice or three times the global endeavor to the developing world every year .
And to do very little .
We all show the models show that we were going to have six years face .
So a type in Bangladesh that will have had a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> can expect to <unk> .
What &apos;s good , but not very good .
So the idea and say , well , we spend a lot of money doing something else .
And just by giving a baseline , the U.N. estimates that the half of that amount , a 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all the main problems in the world .
We could prioritize clean water , sanitation , providing basic <unk> and education all human beings on the planet .
So we should be <unk> , we want to spend twice a lot of good ?
Or is the half doing something wrong ?
And that &apos;s where it turns into a bad project .
It &apos;s not saying it &apos;s all the money in the world , you don &apos;t want to do it .
<unk> , when we don &apos;t have , just not our first priority .
The projects here — I &apos;m not going to comment on all — but diseases , scale , scale to basic services of health care — they &apos;re just simply because , of course , the scale of basic services is a big thing .
There &apos;s a lot of good , but it &apos;s also , but it &apos;s too much , but it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s too much .
Again , what he said and suddenly we started thinking of the two sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , you have a lot of sanitation .
Again , sanitation and water is important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four of the priorities that should be , when fewer , the first one , the first part of us when we talk about how we should be solved the problems in the world .
The higher <unk> is malaria — treating malaria .
<unk> malaria is about a couple of millions of people produced every year .
It could even be a <unk> point of GDP in the year for the year by <unk> nations .
If we <unk> about 13 billion dollars in the next four years , we could reduce the <unk> to half .
We could prevent death from a bunch of individuals , but what perhaps is the most important , we could prevent that billion people have given us every year .
<unk> <unk> their ability to treat many other problems that they have to deal with . Of course , in the long run , also <unk> with global warming .
The third one is the free trade .
Basically , the model showed that if you were able to get rid of their trade , and especially <unk> <unk> in the USA and Europe , we could basically raise the global economy until the <unk> came out of 2 , and the half of the World War .
Again , we could actually find the 200 or 300 million people in the poverty , radically them and very fast , between two and five years .
That would be the third one thing we could do .
The second one would be <unk> in the <unk> .
They weren &apos;t involved in general , but a very economic way of treating the <unk> , is saying , the lack of <unk> .
Basically , the half of the world &apos;s population has made of iron , <unk> , <unk> and vitamin A.
If you were 12 billion dollars , we could make a profound disconnect in this problem .
This would be the second thing that we could do .
And the best project would be <unk> in HIV / AIDS .
Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could prevent 28 million new cases of HIV / AIDS .
Again , what this makes , what do it and what if we want to say that we have two very different ways how to treat HIV / AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is <unk> .
Again , in a ideal world , we would make the two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do any of the two or where we don &apos;t really do it , we will , when we don &apos;t very well , we will , when we should be investing first .
And the treatment is a lot , much more expensive .
So let me tell you , what if you want to do much more investing in the <unk> .
Basically , for the amount of money that we used to do X well in treatment , 10 times more in <unk> .
So once we have more , we need to need more than treatment as the first one .
What this is doing is it &apos;s really empowering to think about our priorities .
I &apos;d like to ask you for your list of <unk> and say , <unk> ?
How do we do something like what we did here ?
Well , <unk> , one of the things is going to be the <unk> of climate change .
We have a lot of people who think it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very unlikely that we did that .
We also would be able to make climate change , if there &apos;s no other reason , just because it &apos;s a big problem .
But naturally , we didn &apos;t solve all the <unk> .
We have many problems in the world .
And what I want to tell you is that if we focus on the problems , we find ourselves in the other way .
You have to do a lot of a lot of a little bit longer .
And I think the truth — Thomas <unk> , one of the subjects of &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; he explained very , very well .
One of the things that people <unk> , and that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the impacts of climate change , people will be a lot more rich .
Even the most insidious impacts of the U.N.
It turns out that a media population in the developing world will be as rich as we are today .
And much more likely , there are two four times richer than we are .
And naturally , we &apos;ll be even more rich than that .
But the thing is , when we talk about to save people , help people in Bangladesh , we &apos;re not talking about a poor <unk> .
We &apos;re talking about a fairly rich <unk> .
And so the real subject , naturally , which is saying , we want to spend a lot of money to help a little bit of it ?
or we want to help the poor people in these moments in Bangladesh , or we want to help the poor people in these moments in Bangladesh , who really needs to help , and who can help them very <unk> ?
Or as the <unk> said , imagine being rich — how will it happen — a rich rich , a rich rich , a rich <unk> , a rich wealthy man in 2005 in 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How do you could have <unk> <unk> ? &quot; &quot; So I think , how do you could have <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s going to be so little of my grandmother in my grandmother and my <unk> , who could have <unk> <unk> , and that would be so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I
Even if you don &apos;t agree with the typical number of view this problem .
And of course , that &apos;s why <unk> <unk> has a lot of good photos .
You know we have a &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — it seems great , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the sense that I want you to see , right , but I don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to take the <unk> Project in your next movie <unk> <unk> in Tanzania or something like this . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s just not from a movie .
So in many ways , I think the <unk> <unk> and the whole discussion about the priorities of the priorities is a defense of boring problems .
To make sure that it &apos;s not just to be able to feel okay , but to make sure that it &apos;s not just to be able to feel okay , but to make sure that it &apos;s not just to be able to feel okay , but to make sure that it &apos;s not just to be able to feel okay , but to make sure that it &apos;s not just to be able to feel okay , but to make sure that it &apos;s not just to be able to feel okay , but to make sure
It &apos;s not going to do the things that they have the greatest <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s also going to talk about places where we can actually do a bigger <unk> .
The other objections , I think it &apos;s important , is that of some <unk> I &apos;m — or we &apos;re — the <unk> of a forged of it .
Of course we have to do it all , in a ideal world — it would be absolutely accurate .
I think we should do all the things , but we don &apos;t do it .
In 1970 , the developed world decided that we went to spend twice as we did , right now , in 1970 in developing developing countries .
As our help are <unk> to half .
It doesn &apos;t think we &apos;re in the way of solving all the big problems .
In the same way , people will say , but there &apos;s the war of Iraq ?
You know , we spend 100 billion <unk> . Why we don &apos;t spend that good in the world .
I am <unk> .
If some of you can talk to you with Bush for it , it &apos;s okay .
But naturally the topic is still saying , if you take some other 100 billion dollars , you &apos;ll be able to remember the best way possible , not ?
So the real problem , it &apos;s beginning to start again and think about what are the appropriate priorities .
Could I mention , is this really the list right ?
You know , when you ask the best economists in the world , I &apos;m going to give you a white men and old men from the United States .
And they &apos;re not necessarily a great way to look at the entire world .
So I <unk> the 80 <unk> of the entire world to make it the same problem .
The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they brought English .
Most of them were , first in the developing world in developing development .
They would have the same material , but they could be able to get away from the topic of the discussion , how they really did , to <unk> their own lists .
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with <unk> and disease and disease and diseases at the end .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
We had many other <unk> students and college students and things different .
They all had as a result the same list .
And that &apos;s a big hope , really , to say that I think there &apos;s a way forward to start thinking about our priorities of it . And saying , what is the most important in the world ?
Of course , in a ideal world , we have to do it all .
But if we don &apos;t do it , we can start to think why ?
I see the <unk> <unk> as a process .
So we did in 2004 , and we hope to have a lot more people , to get much better data in 2008 , 2012 .
It turns out the right way to the world . But we also start thinking about political policy .
To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t do the things that we can afford with a high cost , and the things we don &apos;t know about how to do , but we do not know how to do it , but we make things great where we can make a huge extent , the lower cost , right now . After the day , you might be interested with the discussion of how we can actually do it , but we have to be honest and <unk> to say , if there &apos;s some
If we look a lot about some things about some things , I think we don &apos;t worry about any other .
So I hope that this allows us to be able to change the world , and think how we work better for the world .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I stood outside the house without keys .
He &apos;s just going to get home to the house , and she was going to visit a friend on the other side of the city , and he was very cold , because that temperature took the two scales , and he was very cold .
And I was in <unk> , searching for the pocket and <unk> account that didn &apos;t have the keys .
In fact , he had mastered the window on the table table , where the <unk> .
But they were all <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t walk night on my friend &apos;s house , because by the morning , I had a flight in Europe and I had to take the passport and <unk> .
So thank you and die of cold and cold , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to show you a little bit of it , and I &apos;m going to show you a little bit of it , and I &apos;m going to show you a little bit of <unk> and <unk> on the window .
It costs a lot of money but not more than a <unk> in the middle of the night .
Well , we brought it to the neuroscience of neuroscience .
<unk> <unk> , which elevates the heart rate below the levels of adrenalin .
So the next morning when I came up with me after a little bit , I worried about the course of the course of the time , and I worried that I was going to have been in Europe , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell me , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m going
And until he got the <unk> of the airport , I didn &apos;t realize that she would miss .
So I came back to the house , and with snow and ice , in 40 minutes , I went back to the funeral airport , and I went back to the time , but my seat the other person to another person , but I &apos;m going to take my seat to another person else .
Or , in the case of that , I &apos;m going to tell you something bad things , but in the case of that .
And Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me
It was something that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Gary , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s something like this , and it &apos;s also called <unk> <unk> .
Is a team of experts who try to determine what happened , not ?
Well , in <unk> <unk> , as it explained by it , and then you try to determine what you can do , and then you try to determine what you can do to do .
What I want to talk about today is what we can do today is what we can do to do today is what we can do today .
A few things are obvious , some aren &apos;t so much .
I &apos;m going to start it .
<unk> places around the house for the things they lose easily .
Well , this looks like a common sense , and it &apos;s like that .
There &apos;s a structure of the brain , called the hippocampus that evolved for hundreds of thousands of years to remember the location of important things , and where it &apos;s the <unk> , where if you look at it , there &apos;s a lot of people in the world where they live the <unk> and the enemy .
The hippocampus is part of the brain part of the brain and the hippocampus .
It &apos;s the part of the brain &apos;s part of the brain is the part of the brain .
In fact , there &apos;s somebody who did the experiment of <unk> sense of the <unk> of the <unk> .
But it works well with things that don &apos;t happen too much , and it didn &apos;t have fun .
So there &apos;s no place for the keys .
To miss , a specific <unk> , the glasses of reading , on a specific table .
If you look at a place , and if you look at a place , you &apos;re going to be in your place when the <unk> .
( Laughter ) And when you look at it ?
<unk> an email with the photo of the cloud .
These seem seem obvious .
Remember when we &apos;re under stress , the brain emits <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> and <unk> the mind .
And it turns out that its stress is not going to recognize that it &apos;s not going to be able to make the best of you and you should establish a system .
So when you give you a medical decision .
We &apos;re all going to be a moment in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation that we &apos;re all going on in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in
And I want to talk .

Suppose you go to the doctor and this says , &quot; &quot; I have the <unk> results , and it &apos;s a little bit tall . &quot;
You know that high cholesterol cholesterol .
And I &apos;d like to think that the cholesterol cholesterol is not very good . ( Laughter ) And the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want to get a drug that &apos;s not very good . &quot; &quot; And the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want to give you a drug , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; I want you to make a medication and you know it &apos;s one of the medicines . &quot;
I &apos;m going to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask for a statistic of asking a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a
It &apos;s the number necessary to treat . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s the number .
It &apos;s the number of people who have to <unk> that drug , and that &apos;s the number of people who have to make a sense of a person .
And the question of statistics is that ?
The number should be one . My doctor didn &apos;t get me wrong .
But medicine doesn &apos;t work .
We don &apos;t know about the <unk> mechanisms .
<unk> estimates that 90 percent of the medicines work between 30 percent and 50 percent of the cases .
So what did you do in the case of the more you think ?
How many people have to do before they help someone before ?
This second was the results .
I mean , even the data .
And I &apos;m going to tell you about it .
In the case of this drug drug .
And we include things like <unk> , and <unk> things in the muscles and <unk> <unk> — but it <unk> , &quot; &quot; one five percent . I don &apos;t think of me .
You have 15 times more likely that the drug is going to take you from the drug to <unk> yourself .
I &apos;m not saying if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> or not not saying if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> or not not saying if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> or not , but I &apos;m not saying if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> or not , but I &apos;m not saying if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> or not to tell you if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> or not , but I &apos;m not saying if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> or not not saying if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> or not , but I &apos;m not saying if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> or
And only I would have to have this conversation with your physician , just to have this conversation with your doctor .
You have right to have access to this data to be able to talk to you about the data to talk to you about to talk to you about it .
I mean , I &apos;m talking about this number to <unk> , which I talk about this number to <unk> , but actually the <unk> <unk> that I talk about this number to <unk> , but actually the <unk> <unk> that I talk about this number to <unk> , but actually the <unk> <unk> that I talk about this number to <unk> , but actually the <unk> <unk> I talk about this number to <unk> , but actually the <unk> <unk> that I talk about this number to <unk> , but actually the <unk> <unk> that I talk about
<unk> prostate cancer , the <unk> is 49 .
Yes , you have to do 49 <unk> per person who helps it .
And the side effects in this case is in 50 percent of the patients .
They &apos;re helpless , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , the idea of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the idea of <unk> is that the conversation .
The ideal is not to create all this in the moment .
We also have to think about subjects as the quality of life .
It &apos;s things that we have to think about now and <unk> with the family and people .
Think about stress the brain emits <unk> and one of the things that happens at that moment is that if you have a lot of systems .
Evolution included explanation .
Because if your body has increased metabolism in these things , because if your body has increased metabolism in these things , and you don &apos;t really want to get quickly quickly , because if your body offers metabolism in these things , you don &apos;t really want to miss it .
<unk> , one of the things that separates us from the first one of the things that they carry in is that they have been able to get rid of the things that showed up by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues .
So we need <unk> to think about this kind of <unk> .
I think the most important is to recognize that we all have <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go away .
And the idea is to think about what they can be like , to establish systems that can minimize the damage or just to avoid that other bad things .
We took that night with the snow in the patient , and when I came back to the journey , the key from the door of the house and an easy code of imagining .
They are not fully organized by <unk> <unk> .

It seemed to me because I want to talk to me , because I &apos;m talking to me , because I &apos;m talking to me , I &apos;m going to look at me , because I &apos;m talking to me , because I &apos;m talking to me , I &apos;m going to look at me .

How do you go ?
If you can &apos;t see no problem , it &apos;s better to stop and stop talking .
What I mean is that those expressions would be a specific <unk> .
I have a friend who speaks to me that she &apos;s a <unk> .
One time I asked him that I was going on .
And he told me , &quot; &quot; All very well , but once I spent the whole night , trying to tell you about the entire night trying to get away from the entire night and said , &quot; &quot; All too well , but once I spent late on the whole night , I was trying to tell me . &quot;
So let me tell you that she is not able to tell her husband , and it &apos;s normal that he doesn &apos;t understand ; his husband , and it &apos;s normal he doesn &apos;t understand ; his way of thinking is different .

( Applause ) Well , what we did to protect the Arab language ?
<unk> is the civil society .
But I still have a lot of people saying , &quot; &quot; Why ?
He wrote this question , and he says , &quot; &quot; Why is there ? &quot;
In the campaign to preserve the Arab <unk> : the next <unk> .
We said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; not <unk> this style , because that way we don &apos;t get it .
And when somebody speaks to me , they hate the Arab .
<unk> ... ( Applause ) <unk> we want to change our reality , and to be convinced a way to reflect our dreams , aspirations and day day .
We have to view that view like us and think about how we think .
After that <unk> photos of young people and girls in Arabic .
<unk> of young people and girls <unk> .
We are very <unk> .
And any of you say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;ll get a word in English ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ll tell you the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ll tell the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; but I &apos;m going to give you a more beautiful word , and it deserves better with reality .
I &apos;m going to follow saying the Internet .
If you think of the language , or what do they think they have authority on us , when they look at the language of us , when they think they have authority on us , when they look at the language of us , when they think they have authority on us , when they look at the language of us , when they think they have authority on us , when they look at the language of us , when they think they have authority on us , when they look at the language of us ,
Social language is the way .
Start just since .
A lot is a novel .
I could take the Arabic again again .
But we have to know , and I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s a solution , and that &apos;s what we need to be part of it .
So what can we do here since now ?
See ... <unk> , who is <unk> ?
Please , let me tell you , even my time would have been <unk> .
But I don &apos;t write in Arabic with <unk> characters with numbers .
( Applause ) Is it a <unk> ! Is it not a language !
We &apos;re going to walk away into a virtual world with a virtual language with a virtual language .
And it &apos;s not easy to go back to that world and <unk> .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
Poor babies first were first to her father &apos;s father &apos;s father &apos;s mother &apos;s mother <unk> his father &apos;s mother .
So when I was visiting my daughter , I said , &quot; &quot; This is my <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; This is crap , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; This is a <unk> of <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; This is crap , &quot; &quot; .
What &apos;s happening in the mind ?
If we take this last 30 years , the majority of people , psychologists <unk> , would say that the baby is irrational , <unk> , <unk> — you don &apos;t have to think of the view of somebody else &apos;s view .
Over the last 20 years , the science of the developing development is completely this theory .
In a way , we believe that this baby thought is how thought of this baby &apos;s thought of the most <unk> .
It &apos;s an example of this .
One thing I could be thinking this baby was thinking this baby , which could be happening in his mind , is to address what &apos;s happening in the mind of another baby .
And finally , one of the most difficult things for us is treating us what other people think they think and feel it .
And maybe it &apos;s harder to understand that what else they think and it &apos;s not the same thing that we think and we feel .
Anyone who &apos;s so much of the politics can say why it &apos;s going to be a few people .
We wanted to know if babies and children were able to understand this very complex idea about other people .
The question is , how can we go ?
The babies don &apos;t talk about , and if we ask a child for three years that tells us what we think , we will only be able to be able to make a routine of thoughts on <unk> , <unk> and things .
How can we do it ?
It turns out that the secret was <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , one of my students , and I gave them the two two dishes with food : a <unk> <unk> and another with delicious <unk> .
Every week , even in Berkeley , I don &apos;t like the <unk> and not like <unk> .
( Laughter ) Next , what he did was to <unk> the food of the two dishes .
And he did he loved it or not what he did .
Half of the times , they did do it <unk> and don &apos;t eat it — like any baby or normal person .
But the other half , a little bit of <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s called <unk> . <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s just like you &apos;ll tell you the opposite of what you do .
We did this with 10 and 18 months .
And then let me put it up to your hand and said , &quot; Would you go ? &quot;
The question was : How do we do babies what I want to do with them or their ?
The surprising thing was that the babies of 18 months ago , that comes out of going to walk and talk , I &apos;m going to show you the <unk> if you <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> if you eat it .
On the other hand , the babies of 15 months were <unk> to her if it seemed to the <unk> , as if you couldn &apos;t get it .
And after <unk> , a long rat , <unk> <unk> , what he thought to like the whole world .
So there &apos;s two key data on this .
For one hand , the babies of 18 months have already have <unk> this important source of human nature : we don &apos;t all want the same .
It &apos;s more , they understand how to make action to help other people to get them .
And more interestingly , it is that the babies of 15 months are not doing this , which suggests that the children of 18 months have learned this deep source of the human being in the age of 15 months .
So babies know , babies know more and learning more than we have now .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies that had been done in the last 20 years .
What if you can ask now is why kids teach so much ?
And how is it possible to learn so much time ?
I mean , the first view , babies seem pretty much .
And in a lot of times , they are worse than <unk> , because we have to take a lot of time and energy just to keep learning alive .
If we look at evolution for the answer to look at this mystery of why we &apos;ve lost so much time for babies and babies , it turns out , there &apos;s a response to a response that we &apos;ve lost so much of the answer that we &apos;ve lost so much of the answers that we lost so much for babies .
If you look at several different species of different species , not only other <unk> like us , but also other <unk> , birds , even <unk> as the <unk> or the <unk> , it turns out that there is relationship between the <unk> of childhood , and the relative size of the brain and intelligence flexibility .
One example of this is <unk> of these birds that you can see here .
We have the <unk> of New York <unk> .
<unk> and other <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , are very useless .
So in the right way , they &apos;re so useless like <unk> .
And this is a very trial that has learned how to use tools to get food .
On the other band , we have our <unk> <unk> .
The chickens , like the ducks , <unk> and geese , they &apos;re printed as stones .
They &apos;re very good <unk> , but they &apos;re not really good doing anything else .
It turns out that babies from New York <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
You know , depending on that , you know , depending on that , you know , you know , depending on it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
However , chickens is adult a couple of months .
In so much , childhood is the reason why the <unk> do in the <unk> of the scientific journals used by the chickens pot .
There &apos;s something in <unk> that it seems to be linked to knowledge and learning .
What would we do for this ?
Some animals , like the chickens , look at it to do something very well .
So chickens are very good <unk> in a particular environment .
Other creatures , like <unk> , they &apos;re not particularly good doing any particular thing , but they &apos;re very good for the norms of different environments .
And of course , we humans are very far away in that distribution .
We have the most big brains with our bodies , much more than any animal .
It &apos;s more intelligent , more <unk> , we can learn more , we can survive in many more environments — we have <unk> all around the planet and even face space .
And our babies and children rely on us for a lot more time than babies other species .
My son has 23 .
( Laughter ) At least at the <unk> , we followed <unk> these <unk> in their open hydrants the open hydrants in their open hydrants .
Okay , why do we look at this ?
One idea is that strategy , the strategy of learning , is a very powerful way and strong <unk> in this world .
It turns out that until if you learn everything , if it &apos;s <unk> .
It wasn &apos;t going to be good for us to tell us a little bit of it , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; Would you have a <unk> or a <unk> ?
It would be better to know that before we get <unk> .
And the way that evolution comes to this problem was , it seems to be , with a division of work .
So we have this period of time when we are fully <unk> .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . We just learn .
And then , of adults , we can take that we &apos;ve learned from babies and children and test it into practice for the world .
One way to think about this is that babies and children are like the <unk> and the <unk> of human species .
They are the people who are going to do that , and they just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we are the production and <unk> .
We have to take all of these ideas that we &apos;ve learned from children and focus in practice .
Another way to think is , instead of thinking of babies and children as possible adults , thinking about them as a kind of different developing development of the same species ; like the <unk> and the <unk> . But babies would be the <unk> who <unk> the outside garden in our narrow way of adults .
If this is true , if babies are designed to learn , and this story of evolution shows us that this is how kids are to learn , we can expect to be a very powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the brain &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
But the real computers are improving a lot .
There &apos;s going to be a revolution in our way to understand machines learning .
And all the cause of this man , the <unk> Thomas <unk> , a philosophical and mathematical mathematician in the 18th century .
Basically , <unk> caused by a mathematician who <unk> the theory of the probability that <unk> theory of the probability of probability and describe the way in which scientists are going to do things in the world .
What scientists are doing is a chance , something that could start to start .
Then we had this chance with evidence .
The evidence is going to change the hypothesis , which is , the evidence will change the hypothesis .
What they &apos;re trying to do with new tests , and then they get them together .
Which <unk> showed was a mathematician who could do that .
And math is the basis of the best programs of learning that we have today .
Ten years ago , <unk> babies were doing the same thing .
If you want to know what &apos;s going down at the bottom of these slides , I think it &apos;s something like a very similar thing , and if you want to know what &apos;s going on , I think it &apos;s something very much like it &apos;s going to happen , and if you want to know what &apos;s going to happen , if you want to know what it &apos;s going to happen , if you want to know what it &apos;s going to happen , if you want to know what &apos;s going on , it
<unk> on the <unk> notes .
I think babies are going to do very complicated calculations with odds that <unk> and how it works and how it works as the world .
Well , this is even more difficult to prove .
If we ask a adult human adult , you can feel pretty stupid .
How is it possible to make statistics ?
To test this , we used a machine that we had to call the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a box that lights up and it sounds when you get away from it some particular objects .
By using this simple machine , in my lab , and also in other , if we teach dozens of studies about how good kids are learning about the world .
<unk> just one we did with <unk> <unk> , one of my students .
If you look at this detector , you probably think that the way of <unk> is to put a <unk> on the detector .
But the case is , the detector works in a very strange way .
If you look at a foot on the detector from the detector , something you didn &apos;t think about in a beginning , the detector will increase two of every three times .
So let me tell you what we put on the top , what it would be , just like two of every six times .
So the chance less likely to have some extra tests .
It looks like the strategy of <unk> the object is more powerful than another .
So we explain this data to the children of four and <unk> that <unk> .
And with security , the children of the four years was going to change the data , and then the object comes up .
There &apos;s two interesting data on this thing .
The first one , I would argue that I &apos;m a kid .
They &apos;re learning to tell us ; they &apos;re learning counting ; they &apos;re learning counting .
But it turns out that they &apos;re doing complex calculations that give them a measure of <unk> .
The second one was interesting is that they &apos;re using the evidence to get a thought , a chance about the world , which seems a little bit like the beginning of the world .
In studies that we do in the lab , other similar , we &apos;ve shown that these children from four years are better likely to be able to understand how adults , given the same task .
In these circumstances , children are doing statistics to <unk> things about the world , but scientists , after all , and we wanted to see if kids were too much .
It &apos;s what we &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; I play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a lot of interesting studies lately recently that I &apos;ve described that these games are as a kind of experimental research program .
<unk> one of the lab <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> the kids who had the yellow <unk> , and the red guy not , and the red didn &apos;t look like a malfunction .
What we &apos;re going to see now is this boy <unk> five hypotheses in two minutes .
Child : So ?
Child : Just the other side .
<unk> : Well , the first <unk> hypothesis .
Child : Nothing . ( Laughter ) Child : This is not .
<unk> : It starts to describe the <unk> .
Child : Why does this mean ?
( Laughter ) Child : I don &apos;t understand it .
<unk> : scientists will recognize that face <unk> face .
( Laughter ) Child : Oh , it &apos;s because this has to be like this , and this has to be like this .
<unk> : <unk> .
Child : So has to be .
Child : Oh ... can &apos;t be .
( Laughter ) <unk> : Now , the next idea .
It turns out to the consequence that we had to put into the other .
It didn &apos;t work .
Child : Oh , it &apos;s because the light only goes down there , not until here .
Under this box there is electricity , but this doesn &apos;t .
<unk> : Well , that would be the fourth chance .
Child : Now yeah .
If you get four <unk> .
If you put four <unk> on this , you &apos;ll see it and two to the other .
<unk> : Well , that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
This child is — it &apos;s a very <unk> child and <unk> , but <unk> discovered that it &apos;s a very typical child .
If you look at how I play the kids , if we &apos;re asking them to be something , what they &apos;re doing is to experiment .
Very typical of the age of four .
Well , what do you feel like this type of creature ?
What do you feel like a <unk> of these <unk> that you can test five or two minutes ?
If we go to the theory of psychologists and philosophers , many people who are babies and kids are just aware , or even they &apos;re not in absolute .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think babies and kids are more conscious than adults .
This is what we know about how it works .
<unk> and attention attention is a epileptic focus .
What happens in adults is that when we decide that something is important or relevant , <unk> attention .
Now , the awareness of it is that it &apos;s going to become <unk> and intense , as the rest of the rest you eat .
We also know how this happens in the brain .
When we pay attention to something , the frontal part of the brain , the part of the brain , a part of the brain that makes a little part of the brain if we have a little part of the brain if we have a little part of the brain .
We have a very <unk> attention , right in the way .
If we look at babies and children , we see something very different .
I think babies and kids seem to have a look more like a torch than a focus .
<unk> babies and children have a lot to limit their attention .
But it &apos;s going to be very good at account for a lot of data in a lot of time .
And if you look at their brains , what we see is that they &apos;re <unk> from <unk> to learning and plasticity , and that &apos;s still not accurate .
So when we say babies and children have problems to pay attention , what really means is they don &apos;t pay attention .
<unk> <unk> of the very interesting things that I could say is something about it because it &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the type of awareness we need to expect of those <unk> that are required to learn .
If we want to think about a sense of feeling that kind of a child conscience like adults , I think the best way is to think about how many cases we didn &apos;t have been never before ; every time we didn &apos;t know about somebody , or when we go to a city for the first time .
You know , you know , whether it &apos;s not <unk> , but it turns out that in three days in Paris , there &apos;s a more possible that in Paris , there &apos;s more awareness and experiences that every month around the house , walking up , talking , going on , going on , going on , going on , going on , going on , going on , going on , going on , going on , going on , going on , going on , going on , going on , going on , going
For sure that coffee , that magnificent coffee that we take below , actually increases the effect of the <unk> of the babies .
So how is it a baby ?
It &apos;s like to be boyfriend in Paris for the first time , after the first time , after <unk> three <unk> .
( Laughter ) A wonderful feeling , but that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> of the morning . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s a lot of adult .
I don &apos;t mean too much about the magnificent ones that are babies .
It &apos;s a lot of adult .
We can do things like <unk> or <unk> to cross alone alone .
And it has sense that I &apos;m going to say a lot of effort to do babies like adults .
But if what we want is to be like these <unk> , have your mind open , to be open to learning , imagination , innovation , innovation — perhaps , at least sometimes used to make adults think a little bit like a child .

There &apos;s always no <unk> out of the <unk> that has become more than their bodies <unk> or <unk> .
These objects would agree from many common <unk> , and the objective of <unk> objects is a unique process of <unk> in Europe from the Holocaust of the Holocaust .
No body should be out without discovering or not <unk> .
Again , if you look at these objects that victims would eat their way to their <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> these objects that the victims would eat their own <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> these objects that the victims would eat their own <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> these objects that the victims would take to their <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> these objects that the victims would

And it turns out how tools <unk> in the visual cortex of the victims , but also as <unk> <unk> in the war of the war , but also as <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the war .
Sometimes it &apos;s called <unk> , but the visual recognition is a tough process , <unk> and painful , painful process .
Once we <unk> , doctors and lawyers play with them pass to the narrative of the narrative of the narrative .
A lot of <unk> , even though they don &apos;t measure or just <unk> away from the view of view and the minds of the mind .
A few years ago , I decided to <unk> every single object to create a simple archive that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , a few years , and a few years , and a few years , and a few years , I decided to make sure that the <unk> and the <unk> are a few years ago , and a few years , a few years ago , I decided to make sure that the <unk> and the <unk> was a few years ago , and a few years , I

And in this case , <unk> can recognize objects or at least the photos of the photos are like , and in this case , <unk> can recognize objects or at least the photos of it .
So the picture is empathy and how many of these kinds of <unk> objects .
In this case , I &apos;m just a little tool , a forensic , if you want , and the result is the most possible possible for a document a document .
When you go back to the same way , the bodies will get rid of the bodies and these ordinary objects and other ordinary objects , when they &apos;re going to get rid of it .
In all of his simplicity , these are the <unk> for the identity of the last <unk> of the last <unk> that those people are going to get rid of the other <unk> .

I &apos;m here to share my picture .
Does this picture picture ?
Because of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t get rid of your cameras .
With all of my background in the picture started when I was visiting my first digital camera at 15 .
I want to talk to my passion last year , and it was a little bit different , because if we used the camera the process was more good in the planning .
And when you look at a picture of a camera with a camera , the process ends when you get the <unk> .
To me , I had more to see it in the <unk> seat at the time .
So let me tell you any one could do .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process would lead to the <unk> .
<unk> like this : a building on a very <unk> road .
But it has an unexpected gyrus .
And despite this , it keeps a level of realism .
Or photos like these ... dark and colorful , but all of the common goal of to keep the level of keeping it .
When I say realism , I mean .
Because of course , it &apos;s not something that could be really captured but I always want to look at that was captured in a way like a picture .
So let me tell you how to think a moment to discover the magic .
So this has to look more to see how to capture an idea that we &apos;ve got to really .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it sound real ?
You have to see what you know or the colors ?
You have to do with light ?
What creates the illusion ?
The point of view is the illusion .
But at the end of our way of interpreting the world and how it can be <unk> on a two-dimensional two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not about whether it &apos;s realistic but what we think we think is realistic .
So I think the basics are very easy .
I think it would be like a <unk> of reality when we take different bits of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three physical physical physical objects , something that we can relate to live in a three-dimensional world .
But it seems to be able to create something that &apos;s still a three-dimensional molecule ; as if we get there .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t exist .
So it turns out to our brain because the brain just doesn &apos;t dominate the fact that it actually doesn &apos;t have meaning .
And I see the same process by combining photos .
It &apos;s really important to combine different things .
So the things that make a picture look like realistic , I think they are those ones who don &apos;t even think , the things that we don &apos;t even think .
But when we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to do this . Because of the reverse <unk> in a way .
So I &apos;d like to say that there &apos;s three simple approaches that we follow for <unk> outcomes .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But combined , can create something like this .
So the first <unk> is that the photos combined to have the same view .
Second , photos have to have the same type of light .
And these two images came up with these requirements ; they were <unk> at the same time and the same type of light .
The third point is to do it impossible to tell you where they start and do different images with a perfect <unk> .
It must be impossible to say how to expand the picture in reality .
It was the color , the contrast , the contrast , the contrast that there &apos;s between the different images , by <unk> <unk> like the depth of the field , colors and noise , <unk> the boundaries between the different images and we do it seem like a picture , despite the fact that it seems to have hundreds of layers .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) It could surprise you that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom is what was manipulated .
But this picture is absolutely a lot of different places of different places .
I think it &apos;s easier to create a place that <unk> , because one doesn &apos;t need to compromise the ideas that has in the head .
But this requires a lot of planning .
And as I thought this idea in the winter , I knew I had a few months to design , to find the different places for the bits of <unk> .
For example , fish was captured on an exit .
The coasts are different .
The part was <unk> in a stone <unk> .
And yeah , I was like I saw the house from the <unk> of the island to make it more <unk> .
So for an animal result , I think we don &apos;t need planning .
Every time begins with a <unk> , a thought .
Once I combine the different photos .
And here every piece is very good .
If a good job is going to take the photos to take the photos the result can be very beautiful and rather realistic .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that is there is our imagination .
Thank you .

After puberty was a map of puberty .
And through a technique we are using a technique that we are using all around the world around the world , through a technique that we are using all around the world around the world .
