It was a late afternoon .
<unk> of science <unk> in <unk> , the Union <unk> <unk> .
<unk> my work , but precisely that day would take a little <unk> .
So let me take me away from my fellow Chris <unk> .
( Applause ) Chris <unk> over 30 years ago in <unk> , so the same thing about the institutions .
I told me that I felt a little bit of <unk> .
I was <unk> a number of questions about the intersection of science and freedoms failures : very interesting .
But I wanted to <unk> <unk> these problems more expensive , and I could expect a difference .
Chris was direct to the big and <unk> : &quot; &quot; All of all of these issues , what are the five of us who are the five of us ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; But it &apos;s the genetics of genetics , <unk> technologies , the <unk> and ...
<unk> , there &apos;s a great thing , the job of the <unk> of the <unk> .
Of course , the subject of genetic fashion . &quot; &quot; <unk> genetic ?
Yes , it &apos;s about human genes .
No !
Will we say that the average U.S. <unk> <unk> of the human body ?
It can &apos;t be . &quot; &quot; He said to me three papers .
And 20 minutes later , he came to him <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! Did you reason ! What do you do ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And this is a big lawyer , but I didn &apos;t know almost anything about the patent industry and absolutely nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but it was not <unk> , much less <unk> .
It was clear that there was a lot to learn before I was given to anyone .
First of all , we had to know exactly what &apos;s going on when somebody else would take a gene .
The object that we can do to make dozens of <unk> , but the most part of all things are called &quot; &quot; DNA <unk> , &quot; &quot; or it &apos;s a piece of DNA that &apos;s called a cell .
<unk> of this says , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t make the genes from your body &apos;s genes , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s true , but more the problem is that we need <unk> the genes for <unk> .
And the patent doesn &apos;t get a particular gene gene , but all of the possible version of that gene that gene looks like .
And what does this mean ?
Yeah , you can &apos;t pass your genes into a doctor and <unk> that <unk> , to see if it turns out , without the permission of the patent <unk> .
It also means that the headline of the patent has the right to stop that gene has been to stop in research or clinical trials .
<unk> who are <unk> , the kid companies , <unk> , <unk> parts of the human genome was <unk> to the patients .
We have the case of <unk> , a small <unk> <unk> , a heart disease , if it &apos;s not about it , it can cause the sudden death .
The company that has <unk> the two genes associated with this disease , to diagnose the syndrome .
But then he came to <unk> and never came to <unk> .
But the company <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
Two years without power to do it .
Over that time , it <unk> died of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem that we would take to patients .
Do you think any way in your front ?
Because it turns out that the Supreme Court stopped , of a long list of cases , there &apos;s a series of things that are not <unk> .
You can &apos;t have <unk> products of nature : air , water , minerals , the elements of the table .
It &apos;s not even the laws of nature : the law of gravity , and = <unk> .
They are very crucial things , and they need to be the grasp of all , but they need to be the grasp of all .
In our opinion , DNA structure , the structure of the most critical life , that we encode the production of all of our proteins , it &apos;s so much a product of nature like a nature of nature , regardless of that if we have <unk> in our bodies or at the bottom of a <unk> .
To get better <unk> , <unk> across the country to talk to about different specialists : scientists , doctors , lawyers , of patents .
Most of you who we had right now from a political view , and , when we least in theory , from a legal view .
And all of them thought the chance to get out of our own topic were so much like scratch .
But why ?
It turns out that the patents of patents leads to us over 20 years .
It was literally thousands of human genes .
The patent court was very <unk> in the status quo , the biotechnology industry we had around this practice , and the whole thing to disrupt the patents that year after the 19th century , without going to go on .
In short , the courts were not going to be willing to <unk> these patents .
Again , I don &apos;t care and tell us the challenges of the challenges , and that &apos;s us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not enough , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to be more <unk> to follow .
So we started asking our cause .
<unk> by patents meant to be : <unk> demand to <unk> B by some technical topic .
( Laughter ) And we didn &apos;t tell us that kind of causes of causes , we think of our cause of a much more .
<unk> of the scientific freedom , human progress and medical rights .
So we decided to open a cause that wasn &apos;t going to be like the media that &apos;s by patent , but a cause of the most <unk> rights .
We &apos;ve been able to identify an object that was that he was advocating that he was advocating for their patents to organize a <unk> <unk> and experts who would send them to the courts as these <unk> <unk> of patients and innovation .
We think the ideal candidate to <unk> was <unk> <unk> , a company with headquarters in Salt Lake City , <unk> .
It has <unk> the patents of two genes , the genes <unk> and the <unk> .
The women with certain mutations in these genes have more likely to get breast cancer and <unk> .
There was a total disconnect about the evidence of <unk> <unk> in the United States .
He did that several labs on <unk> <unk> evidence of <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of money for their test : over 3,000 dollars .
They had to share their clinical trials with the international science community .
And , if it gets worse , for a long period of a couple of years , I was able to <unk> it as additional mutations that had been identified by any additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France .
<unk> that during a several years ago , until a few years ago , to 12 percent of women &apos;s women would have made a wrong answer : a negative result that should be positive .
This is <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> , Esther , developed cancer with 40 years did work with <unk> .
<unk> gave it negative .
The family <unk> .
The more likely was that cancer wasn &apos;t going to be present in the family , so the other family members of the family didn &apos;t need to do the test .
Over two years later , <unk> <unk> was a prostate cancer .
It turned out to the <unk> <unk> of that 12 percent of people who received a negative result .
If you look at the right outcome , you would get the right result , you would make the test , and would you get your cancer cancer .
I could afford these problems .
<unk> genetics , social organizations , four different organizations , four different organizations that we have in defense of 150,000 scientists and professionals , four , four scientific organizations that we &apos;ve been able to do , because of the patent .
One of the main challenges we &apos;re facing when we prepare this case was to think how to explain the science .
To argue that what I &apos;ve done was not an <unk> , and that the genes will <unk> the products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , of the guy : What is a gene ?
As if the DNA island , and why isn &apos;t a place ?
We spend hours of hours and hours of time with our <unk> and experts , trying to take a way to explain these concepts that &apos;s more <unk> .
And at the end of the end with the <unk> hand , like the gold .
So <unk> DNA is like turning gold from a <unk> or a river .
You can <unk> the process to extract gold , but you can &apos;t <unk> the gold .
So the way I work with you to extract the gold gold ; you can &apos;t <unk> it , it &apos;s going to be gold .
And the gold one , once came out , you can use it into all sorts of things that you couldn &apos;t use when I was on the mountain ; with him to make it <unk> , for example . But you can &apos;t <unk> the gold .
In 2009 , we were ready to do the case .
<unk> in the face of the Federal Reserve district district district in New York City , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In the poorest of 2010 , the judge <unk> issued his <unk> : <unk> pages .
When you follow your opinion , you &apos;ll get the <unk> to describe the science in the case .
I mean , our report — it was pretty good , but not so good .
How could we develop a profound knowledge of the subject in so little time ?
We can &apos;t even imagine how it was going on something like this .
So it turned out to the <unk> that he was working on the judge , not just a lawyer — it was science .
And not only scientific scientist — I had a Ph.D in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) Wow .
So <unk> appealed to the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And here things are interesting .
First of this case , the global government has changed .
In the court district , the government issued a <unk> <unk> .
But in the direct hand in your own office office , the government would take a report in what you would call this topic to the decision of the court of the district district , and <unk> that DNA will not be <unk> to be <unk> .
This was very important , and absolutely unexpected .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> leads all of the Federal Reserve , and it &apos;s called its <unk> <unk> .
So even with this event , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And so it was .
More or less .
The decision was 2 against one .
But the two of the two meditators who voted against us , they wrote a completely different consequence .
The first , the judge <unk> , has created its own and new theory theory , totally wrong .
( Laughter )
We will never forget that , why I had no sense .
The other judge , the <unk> Moore , said that we are going to take us instead of being DNA into a product of nature .
But I don &apos;t want to <unk> the patent industry . &quot; &quot; The third one , the judge <unk> , gave me the reason .
You have to make a question that you have to ask you to respond to the court .
So , these questions <unk> the shape of a paragraph paragraph , a kid , a lot of <unk> a lot of <unk> , where it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
We &apos;ve done the most short question that we never received .
Five words : Am I <unk> human genes ?
When Chris asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; Well I don &apos;t know .
I think , &quot; &quot; Is the DNA <unk> <unk> ? &quot; &quot; No .
I want them to get the same reaction I had the same reaction I had to talk to about this topic seven years ago , and of course , I was going to say I ?
The Supreme Court only <unk> around one percent of the cases that we call it , and we &apos;ll hear our own .
It gets the day of oral Paulo , and it was very , very exciting — with a lot of people outside , the people who hadn &apos;t experienced since 2 : 30 from the next to try to get into the <unk> .
Two organizations in our chest cancer , a lot of people who are working on the <unk> of the <unk> .
Chris and I <unk> together , in the hallway , before he was giving him the most important case of his career .
I was much more nervous than he .
But all of that panic that <unk> <unk> when I got in the room and I saw myself as a lot of <unk> <unk> : women who were known as much of their own careers — women who would have known a lot of time from their own careers in order to get to this fight , representatives of a diverse spectrum , a diverse spectrum , a diverse spectrum , a diverse spectrum , a diverse spectrum , a diverse spectrum , a diverse spectrum , a diverse spectrum , a diverse spectrum , a diverse spectrum ,
In the room , they were also three leaders of the Human Genome Project , including the <unk> of DNA , James Watson , who had a report to the court , when he said that the genes was a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> was <unk> .
Chris claimed it claimed that .
But to me , the hardest thing was to see the <unk> of the Supreme Court trying to understand the DNA <unk> through a series of <unk> <unk> and dialogues <unk> , very similar to how I &apos;ve done our legal team for the last seven years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> plant .
The judge <unk> <unk> with making a <unk> card from a tree .
And at the time it was my favorite moment , the <unk> Renaissance found that the <unk> DNA was the nature of it .
A natural segment is a product of DNA is a product of nature , and it &apos;s not just <unk> .
And what &apos;s more , it didn &apos;t have made it nothing . &quot; &quot; So , we and four hours after the decision , five labs will be able to <unk> the test for the <unk> genes .
Some of them would take us off the cheaper exams than <unk> .
Some of you have <unk> a more <unk> test that <unk> <unk> .
But the decision of court was going beyond <unk> .
<unk> with a couple of years ago that we would have <unk> human genes in the United States .
<unk> <unk> that it was innovation and research .
And they helped patients like <unk> , <unk> , and he had access to the exams they needed .
A few weeks after that court took a little package , I got a little package on the box of email .
It was Bob <unk> , a teacher at Yale University and one of the first people that I and Chris went to visit .
( Laughter ) So we got a lot to this case .
And part of what gave us the courage to address those risks was to know that we were doing the right thing .
The process lasted almost eight years since the beginning , with a lot of <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , lucky helped to help , but they &apos;ve been the communities that <unk> , and the <unk> we created , the ones that we create , the ones we &apos;ve created .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to show you a <unk> from eight of my projects , made by <unk> artist <unk> .
We called <unk> <unk> &amp; <unk> &amp; <unk> &amp; <unk> &amp; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , what I call &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The Great letter . &quot; &quot; <unk> in the peculiar habit of my uncle constantly taught that he does something for him , almost as if I was an extension of his body — turning the lights out of a water or a package of tobacco .
When I grew up , the thing was the worst , and you &apos;ll see how a control form .
Of course , he couldn &apos;t say nothing because the uncle is a <unk> figure in the <unk> .
What &apos;s more <unk> and <unk> was his use of it .
He <unk> his <unk> and <unk> that I <unk> the number for him .
In the answer , and as I gift to my uncle , <unk> , &quot; &quot; The Great letter . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that they make two people to use .
It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a <unk> cell phone to a person .
The problem is that when you go home and I went to university , I started to university , I started to see the least its commands .
So I had a machine writing machine that could give his <unk> commands to <unk> <unk> and <unk> across the world of emails .
What I had to do was take a paper , put the paper on the car , writing the paper on the car , write email and pull the paper .
This device called him automatically automatically the person in a matter of philosophy .
So here you can see that there &apos;s a lot of electronic distances that they understood all the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in digital .
So my name is only a mechanical interface .
And since then , the object has to be great and to have a touch of <unk> , like like my uncle .
The next job is a sensitive device to be called &quot; &quot; The <unk> . &quot; &quot; We wanted to work with the <unk> of being surrounded by an <unk> of <unk> creatures , sensitive sensitive and sweets .
This works like this . We have these <unk> here on the wall , and behind that , we have these little creatures that are <unk> .
Instead we get in silence , <unk> .
And if there &apos;s more silence , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
And at the very least one , again , again .
So we have this <unk> in three walls from a room .
And we had some 500 of these little <unk> <unk> behind .
And so it &apos;s how it works .
This is a video prototype prototype .
When there are silence , they go back to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> like humans or the real creatures .
And it &apos;s going to give you the sounds of sound that you &apos;re going to do .
Don &apos;t respond to the sound sounds .
<unk> a train at a moment when you don &apos;t respond .
( noise ) But respond to sound like the first plan .
( <unk> ) We worked very hard to do the more realistic realistic possible .
Each <unk> has its own behavior , the psyche , changes , personalities , etc .
This is a very premature prototype .
Of course , it was the best after that .
We took it to the people , but we &apos;ve seen that people was a lot of <unk> and infant with them .
This is a video device called &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; So we were really struck by the idea of play with the invisibility of invisibility .
How would it be possible to experience invisibility ?
We worked with a trade company in <unk> <unk> , and we asked them to make a software with us using a camera that could look for people in the room , then next people and listen to a person with the bottom , and we &apos;re going to get a person with it .
I &apos;ll show you a very premature prototype .
In the right , you can see my colleague <unk> , which was done in space .
And on the left , you &apos;ll see the video <unk> where the camera does invisible .
<unk> enters the fourth . Wow .
You can see as a camera .
It &apos;s a premature video , so you don &apos;t have to <unk> the <unk> and all of that , but it &apos;s going to take it soon , more on .
This was a room in a room where there was a camera looking at space and we had a monitor on each wall .
And second people would take it into the room , and it &apos;s going to make people in the room , except for a distinction : a person was constantly invisible to where they want to be in the room .
This work is called &quot; &quot; The shadows of the sun . &quot; &quot; It was almost like a piece of paper , like a <unk> of a child &apos;s license of oil or a sun .
So in front of this object , this is going to be very strong and robust and robust , almost pretty weak .
People are <unk> by the room and almost <unk> thinking that it was some <unk> .
But in the corner , it &apos;s going around , and it &apos;s going to get it through the wall .
<unk> and <unk> always .
( Laughter ) This work is a <unk> of a setback .
His head is so heavy , filled with heavy thoughts , which looks like it falls in his <unk> and his body body grows like a plant .
What makes it move around the head of your head as if you were walking from a very <unk> movement , it &apos;s going through a slow motion .
It &apos;s like thank you for that circle .
Because if that circle didn &apos;t go there and the soil outside the ground , they &apos;ll go back to the space .
And there &apos;s no wires .
Take an example . When people go into the room , we have this object .
And very slowly , in a lot , in the minutes , it &apos;s bad , it gets powerfully , it turns out it &apos;s the point of fall .
This is an important moment , because we wanted <unk> on the viewer &apos;s gut going and help or save the subject .
We don &apos;t need the needs because he even did it again .
This work was a <unk> challenge for us , and we worked very hard , as most of our jobs , for years to get a mechanic , a balance and an perfect definition .
It was very important for us to start the exact moment when it <unk> , because if we were going to do it , because if we were able to make it balance , then we would take it , and if you don &apos;t have enough enough , you don &apos;t have that <unk> , or that you want to go to the help .
I &apos;m going to show you a very fast video where we do a quiz . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my own mate .
Now it &apos;s going to make it nervous , so it goes to you .
But you don &apos;t need to do it , because it can get it by itself .
This is a job that we &apos;ve been really intrigued by , working with the <unk> <unk> <unk> with thousands of <unk> fiber <unk> fiber of the night .
And it &apos;s the scale of the night sky .
We took this around from a drop in a way of <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> from the age .
The idea was <unk> something so cold , distant and abstract , like the universe of a <unk> bear , which is very comforting and important .
The idea was that when I looked at the way I look at the shape of a <unk> bear and almost <unk> as a hole in space , as if you look at an ancient night sky .
This is the last job , still in the process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> space . &quot; &quot; Imagine a little bit of a big front of you in the middle of the room , and you see it as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in a trashcan twice and four times its volume .
This object is in constant <unk> and <unk> to create a dynamic with people with <unk> <unk> , as if you would expect to hide a secret in their own together or something like this .
We work with a lot of technology , but actually we don &apos;t like to like , because it &apos;s a lot of suffering in our work for years .
But we &apos;re using it because we &apos;re interested in the way that we help value emotions and patterns of behavior in these creatures that we create .
When a creature comes in the mind , and it &apos;s almost like the creation process was discovering the way that this creature wants to exist , that way you want to take and how you want to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to start asking you a useful trick , not technology , and all the way requires you is this : that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
But before I <unk> , I want to <unk> right now , even if you &apos;re going to play your body .
And see , how many of you are in some form <unk> ?
<unk> , with <unk> legs , <unk> <unk> .
Sometimes we use their arms .
Sometimes it &apos;s <unk> . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll tell you that I see .
<unk> attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re going back to this one in the minutes , and I hope that if you take a little can change the development of your life .
Well , we &apos;re <unk> with the body language and <unk> , especially the local language of other people .
You know , <unk> ... ( Laughter ) A little bit up — ( Laughter ) an interaction on it , a smile , a <unk> seat or even something like a seat of hands .
Narrator : So here are the number 10 .
This cop is lucky and open to the president of the United States .
There &apos;s the first minister — No . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy <unk> : A bag of hands , or his <unk> , he could tell me about weeks and weeks .
The BBC and the New York Times .
So when you think about it in sound , it &apos;s not verbal or verbal language — ( Laughter ) we call it not to verbal language .
When we talk about communication we think about interactions .
What about your body language ?
What do you talk to me ?
There are reasons to believe that this is true .
Sociologists spend a lot of time we spend a lot of time , or from other people , about the <unk> .
We make <unk> and <unk> language .
These <unk> can actually predict how important <unk> might be important in life like who we would have to do a quote .
For example , <unk> <unk> , researcher at the University of <unk> , demonstrates that when someone sees 30 seconds of videos without a real <unk> <unk> of the <unk> physician if that doctor will be <unk> or not .
So you don &apos;t have to do so much with if the doctor was or not <unk> , but with you like that person , and as you liked it .
It &apos;s even more <unk> , Alex <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> of political candidates in a second 70 percent result in the middle of the career , and the Senate &apos;s the same , in the digital <unk> , the <unk> is used in the <unk> of that <unk> .
If you do a bad use of theirs is bad idea , right ?
Much of language is not verbal is to talk about how we <unk> others , and what are the consequences .
But we tend to forget the other audience in which it impacts our language , not verbal , that we are ourselves .
<unk> our language is not verbal , our thoughts , feelings and physiology .
How can language you don &apos;t mean ?
I &apos;m going to be a social psychologist . I study the <unk> and I teach it in a business school , so that it was inevitable that I &apos;ve changed the dynamics of power .
<unk> about all of their <unk> don &apos;t secure and <unk> .
What are the ones not <unk> and <unk> ?
Well , it &apos;s like this .
In the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , and in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal kingdom , in the animal
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , basically <unk> .
It &apos;s about <unk> .
And it works like this in the animal kingdom , but it works like this .
It doesn &apos;t limit only to <unk> .
Humans do the same . ( Laughter ) They have to have the same . ( Laughter ) They have to have power in the time .
This is especially interesting because it tells us the ancient and universal exhibit that are the ones of power of power .
This expression is known as though , and it was studied by Jessica <unk> , that &apos;s been studied by Jessica <unk> .
And that tells us that we don &apos;t tell us that both people that you see as much as the people who are actually born since the people who are blind people who are blind people who are blind to make a physical competition .
So when you zoom into the line and make it doesn &apos;t matter if you never saw anybody to do it .
They &apos;re just like this .
<unk> &apos;s arms , <unk> .
What do we do when we feel helpless ?
We ask the opposite .
<unk> . <unk> .
<unk> small .
We don &apos;t want to worry about who is our own .
And both animals like humans do the same .
And this is what happens when we take power with helplessness .
What we tend to do when it &apos;s about power is empowering language , not verbal language .
So if someone comes so powerful with us , we tend to have some smaller experience .
We do the opposite .
If I see this behavior in the class , what would you do ?
It tells us that the students from MBA will <unk> all the language will not be verbal .
There are people who are <unk> from <unk> , come into class , <unk> at the very same way before I start as a class .
When you sit down , it turns virally .
<unk> your hand .
And then there are other people that come out of <unk> .
<unk> in his face and in his body , sit in the chair , and you sit down in the chair , and they &apos;re doing so when it <unk> your hand .
So here watch two things .
One doesn &apos;t tell you .
You &apos;ll have to see with sex .
Women are more likely to do that men .
Women are always fewer powerful with men , so that &apos;s not surprising .
But the other thing I noticed is that seems that it seems to be related to the Cambridge grade of the students of students and with his level of physics .
And this is very important at the time of MBA , because it counts to the average of the bill .
So business schools have been fighting with <unk> <unk> .
<unk> women and men just <unk> , and then you see these differences in the notes , which will be solved by part of this .
So I started to <unk> : if there are people who come together with that attitude and <unk> , and then I started to <unk> : if there are people who come together with that attitude and <unk> , and then I started <unk> : if there are people who come together with that attitude and <unk> , and then I started <unk> : if there are people who come together with that attitude and <unk> , and then I started <unk> : if there are people who come together with that attitude and <unk> , and then I
It would be possible to do that other <unk> , and that would be possible to participate , to participate , to participate more ?
My collaborator <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s in Berkeley , and I wanted to know if you can get it to do it .
So , you can do it just by a moment and experience a result in your behavior that makes you feel more powerful ?
We know that language will not look at what other people feel and they think of us . There &apos;s a lot of evidence .
But our question was , whether language is not verbal language , but we think of ourselves ?
There are some evidence that this is .
For example , we know when we &apos;re happy , but also when we take the <unk> to laugh , we &apos;ll make it feel happy .
It works in the two <unk> .
When it comes to power , it &apos;s also working on two <unk> .
When we feel powerful is more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when it &apos;s been powerful to be powerful , it &apos;s more likely to feel powerful .
Well , the second question of reality was , well , we know that the mind would take your body to our body , but it &apos;s also true that the body keeps our mind ?
And when I say , in the case of powerful , what I &apos;m talking about ?
But I talk about thoughts and feelings and feelings of <unk> that make these thoughts and feelings , and in my case , talk about hormones .
How is the mind of the powerful compared to what &apos;s not ?
The powerful people tend to be , it &apos;s not surprising , but it &apos;s not surprising , but more optimistic .
They have the feeling that they &apos;re able to win even in <unk> games .
They also tend to think of a more abstract way .
And there &apos;s a lot of difference . We get more risks .
There &apos;s a lot of difference between the powerful and the powerful ones that are not .
<unk> also is a difference in two key hormones : the testosterone , which is the hormone of the <unk> , and the <unk> , which is the hormone of the stress .
The males don &apos;t get a lot of power in the <unk> <unk> , they have high levels of testosterone and low levels of <unk> . And the powerful leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders and effective leaders .
What means this ? By talking about power , I &apos;m talking about the testosterone , because I had to see with <unk> .
But the power also has to do with our reactions to stress .
We want a dominant leader , with lots of testosterone levels , but sensitive to stress ?
It doesn &apos;t , truth ?
We want a person who is powerful , <unk> and dominant , but not very sensitive to stress , a person who is quiet .
We know that in the <unk> <unk> , if a <unk> has to take control , if somebody has to embrace the control , take suddenly a sudden , in the deadline of the days of the days , his testosterone would take a lot of it and <unk> it as well .
We have that evidence , that the body can <unk> the mind , at least the facial level , and also the paper paper can <unk> the mind .
So what happens when you look at a role of paper ? What happens if you make a minimum level , like this little <unk> or <unk> ?
<unk> : &quot; &quot; I want to tell you for two minutes , so it will make you experience more powerful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what we did .
We decided to bring people to the laboratory and do a small experiment , these people <unk> , for two minutes , both the <unk> , of power or weakness , and I &apos;m going to show you right now five of these <unk> , even though they &apos;re just two .
This is one .
A couple more more more than a couple more pair more plus a couple more pair more plus a couple more pair more plus a couple more pair more plus a couple more pair more plus a pair of more pair .
The <unk> press <unk> the <unk> .
Here we have a couple more .
You can stand on , or sitting .
Here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
Now , <unk> , small .
This is very low power .
When we put <unk> <unk> <unk> , really .
This is what happens .
They come in , put it in a jar , and it &apos;s a <unk> for two minutes , and you have to do this or that . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t see the photos of <unk> .
We don &apos;t want to <unk> a concept of power .
We want to change the power .
They have this two minutes .
And then I <unk> it , &quot; &quot; how powerful you feel ? &quot; &quot; then we gave them the chance to go , at the end we take another <unk> .
That &apos;s all . This is all experiment .
This was what we found .
<unk> at the risk , you bet , we found that when they &apos;re in a position of high power , we would have to go to 86 percent .
When they &apos;re in <unk> <unk> , only 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant distinction .
Let &apos;s see what we found with testosterone .
<unk> from his normal situation to get , people often find a increased increase of the 20 percent and the <unk> experience of the 10 percent .
Again , two minutes , and we &apos;ll look at these changes .
Now the results with <unk> .
The most powerful experience has a 25 percent decrease , the most <unk> experience of the 15 percent .
There &apos;s only two minutes <unk> these <unk> changes that would take your brain to do it , safe or <unk> or <unk> , or a lot of stress .
We all know that feeling , right ?
We would argue that our language will not look at the way of giving ourselves to ourselves , not just too much , but the same ourselves .
The body can <unk> the mind .
So the next question , of course , is — can a gesture of power in a very significant life ?
This is the laboratory , this experiment , just two minutes .
Where can we really apply this ?
That &apos;s what we care about .
We think where you need it to be in <unk> in which you take them , like in the social <unk> <unk> , you think where you need it to be in <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If you look at your friends .
For adolescents is at the table table .
For some people , I &apos;m talking about <unk> school .
It may be by making a business or giving a talk like this or going to a job interview .
I &apos;m going to tell you one of the most people I &apos;ve tried to figure out why many people would identify because of it , the interview job .
So we published the results , the press <unk> , and said , well , this is what you &apos;re going to do when you go to an interview , right ?
( Laughter ) Of course , we have <unk> <unk> and said , no , no , no , no , no .
For many reasons , I don &apos;t have that .
Again , it &apos;s not that other people .
This is about you .
What do you do before go to a job interview ?
You &apos;re going to sit . <unk> your iPhone ... or your Android , you won &apos;t leave one outside .
<unk> your text messages , you &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , when you really should be doing it is this , maybe the <unk> , okay , it &apos;s going to go .
This is what we want to grade .
<unk> people in the laboratory , and he <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> interview <unk> <unk> <unk> interview , <unk> people in the lab .
After five minutes of <unk> .
And also the ones are <unk> , and the <unk> are going to be able to do it not to let it look like this .
Imagine that this person would tell you .
For five minutes , nothing , it &apos;s worse than you <unk> .
People do this .
It &apos;s what Marianne &apos;s <unk> calls &quot; &quot; standing in the social media . &quot;
This is the interview to the <unk> , because we wanted to see what <unk> .
We have analysts , four in total .
They don &apos;t know the chance . Don &apos;t know the conditions .
They don &apos;t have the idea that there could take every single person and the end of looking at all the seafarers , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , all the <unk> of power .
We don &apos;t want to hire <unk> .
Do you make a much more positive arrangement in general . &quot; &quot; What was happening ?
It &apos;s not about content content .
It &apos;s the presence of the presence that you have to do with speech .
So , if you look at all of these <unk> <unk> asked the competition , it &apos;s going to be good about it ?
Do you do it well ? What ratings do ?
These things don &apos;t affect . This is what it makes .
This kind of things .
Every person <unk> itself , basically .
<unk> what they are .
<unk> their ideas , for themselves , without any extra .
So this is what it is or <unk> the effect .
When I talk to people about this , that our body changes our mind and behavior can change our way to be , and it says , &quot; &quot; It looks like . &quot; &quot; Oh , yeah .
I <unk> : <unk> until you do it .
I don &apos;t look like this .
I don &apos;t want to get there and <unk> like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to <unk> it as a <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to get there to feel that he wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
This is very important to me , because I want to tell a little story about being a <unk> , and I feel like I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
When I was 19 , I had a terrible car car .
( Laughter ) You know , I watched it , and I gave a bunch of <unk> .
You &apos;ll hear your car ate .
<unk> in intensive care unit in the head of college , and I was told that my <unk> <unk> two world was very stressful .
<unk> my <unk> , because I &apos;m going to <unk> it as <unk> , and he <unk> a <unk> girl .
So I talked about college and I tried to go back .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t let the career .
You have to accept that there are other things that you can do , but in your case this doesn &apos;t . &quot; &quot; So I had to deal with that , and I have to deal with that , and I have to deal with that , and I have to deal with it , and I have to deal with it and I have to tell me it was the thing more helpless .
We had absolutely misunderstood .
So I worked and I worked and I &apos;ve been working , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky .
Finally came to university .
It was four years more with my fellow women , and I was able to convince somebody , my <unk> , Susan <unk> , so that I was <unk> , and I ended up in Princeton , and I felt like not supposed to be there .
The night before the first course of the first course , the first course of the first course , the first course of the first course of the course of the first course , the first course of the first course of the course of the first course , the first course of the first course of the course of the first course , the first course of the first course of the course of the first course , the first course of the first course of the first course , the first course of the first course of
It &apos;s like this .
I was so afraid of <unk> <unk> and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave you . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to leave it . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re going to leave anything , because I think it &apos;s about you and you &apos;re going to stay .
You &apos;ll be careful , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
You &apos;re going to do all the exhibitions you &apos;re going to do .
It &apos;s just going to do it , and it &apos;s going to be able to do it , and they &apos;re still born and they &apos;re even paralyzed and having a sense of experience , until it goes to the moment that it &apos;s going to get the moment of it .
I got here . I &apos;m doing it now . And that &apos;s what I did .
Five years ago a few years ago , a few years ago , you know , at Harvard , I &apos;m now at Harvard , now I &apos;m not thinking about it , but for a lot of time I had the feeling that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
At the end of my first year at Harvard , a student who didn &apos;t take the class in the whole class , to what we call it , &quot; &quot; Look , you have to participate or go , &quot; &quot; he came to my <unk> . I didn &apos;t know before .
Indeed , I &apos;m not supposed to be here .
That was my moment .
Because we &apos;ve done two things .
The first one I realized : <unk> ! I don &apos;t feel like this .
I didn &apos;t feel like this , but she &apos;s going to get it in his place .
The second was , of course , to be here .
So let &apos;s zoom in and you can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course . Yes , yeah . Yes . &quot;
It &apos;s going to be <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> it , and you know what — ( Applause ) You &apos;ll be able to go to the class and you &apos;re going to make the best speech of everyone . &quot; &quot; And you know ? He did the best speech in all of all , people <unk> and said , &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t have to <unk> it , but if you &apos;re going to <unk> it up . ( Laughter ) She came up to me for a few months later ,
And so we <unk> it .
Now I want to tell you that there &apos;s no way to do it .
There are also us to turn out .
There are so long that it was going to take and <unk> .
The last one I &apos;m going to say is this .
<unk> changes can lead to large <unk> .
It &apos;s just two minutes .
Before I went to the next situation where I was going to <unk> , for two minutes , I would like this , in the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
This is what you have to do .
<unk> the brain to get the best of that situation .
They gave them the testosterone .
We don &apos;t have any <unk> of it , but I didn &apos;t know who are .
<unk> of that situation with the feeling that I &apos;m going to say who I &apos;m going to tell you who are and I want you to prove who you &apos;re going to tell you who are and I &apos;m going to prove who you &apos;re going to say who you are .
I want to talk to you before anything that would take a position of power , and I also want to try to share the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My ego doesn &apos;t depend on this . ( Laughter ) <unk> , <unk> people , because the best you can use are those without technology , without technology or <unk> .
<unk> with them because they can do it in private .
They just need their body , privacy and two minutes to change their lives of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is the most big problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s a good option .
( Laughter ) Instead I &apos;m going to talk about what are the big problems in the world ?
And I should say , before I keep going on , I <unk> each one of you who <unk> <unk> and paper because I &apos;m going to ask me to see how we do it .
So I <unk> <unk> and paper .
So finally , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world outside there .
I &apos;m going to <unk> just a few .
800 million people pass hunger .
One billion people don &apos;t have access to the water <unk> .
Two billion without sanitation .
Three billion people die of HIV and AIDS .
<unk> <unk> .
Two billion people who are going to really close affected by the climate change — and it &apos;s <unk> .
We have many , many , many problems there .
In a ideal world , the <unk> will all , but we don &apos;t .
The truth is that we don &apos;t solve all problems .
And if we don &apos;t do it , the question I think we should do — and that &apos;s the reason why we are in the <unk> economy — is saying , if we don &apos;t do all , we have to start asking ourselves , that problems should solve us first ?
That &apos;s the question I would like to say .
If we were to say , 50 billion of <unk> to spend in the next four years to improve this world , where we should be able to spend it ?
<unk> 10 of the greatest challenges of the world and just <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> movements , <unk> movements , sanitation and water , movements and <unk> movements .
We think of these , many ways , <unk> the world &apos;s greatest problems .
So , the question would be <unk> , what do you think are the greatest ?
Why should we begin to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s asking about a wrong problem .
In fact , that was the <unk> of what he talked about in <unk> .
But <unk> , there &apos;s a problem if you &apos;re going to tell people that are going to happen in problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
There &apos;s probably the biggest problems we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to solve that , we have ?
So it &apos;s not <unk> problems , but it &apos;s going to <unk> the solutions to the problems .
And it had become — naturally it &apos;s a little bit more complicated .
To <unk> climate change , it would be something like <unk> .
To <unk> diseases , they could be clinics or networks for mosquitos .
To <unk> , they would be the peace forces of the U.N. , and we could continue .
What I &apos;d like to say was to tell me that I was going to do it , and in 30 seconds — and I know a lot of way is something impossible — <unk> what you think are <unk> priorities .
And also — in this is , naturally , where the economy goes through — <unk> what we shouldn &apos;t do in the first place .
What should I be at the end of the list ?
Please take it just 30 seconds , maybe it <unk> with people <unk> , and just imagine what they should be the main priorities and the least <unk> of the solutions that we have to do for the world of the world .
The amazing thing about this process — of course , I mean , I mean , I just have 18 minutes to tell you a important amount of time , right ?
I &apos;m sorry to say , and you &apos;re going to think about this process , and that &apos;s what we actually did .
And I also recommend it , and I &apos;m sure we also have these <unk> , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;re going to have these <unk> , then to think , how do we really get really ?
Since then , there are some who ask the same , why has never done a list like this ?
And one reason is that <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
Nobody wants to do .
Of course , all organizations will be at the highest of a list like that .
But also all <unk> <unk> will not be on the highest .
And there &apos;s a lot more likely to have no <unk> numbers , which numbers , is logical not to want a list like this .
It &apos;s 60 years ago that there &apos;s the U.N. , and it &apos;s not just a basic list of the big things we can do in the world , and said , what should we do first ?
This doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re not going to <unk> them — every decision is a <unk> , so we &apos;re not only <unk> — and that &apos;s not sure it &apos;s as good as if we really did it , and that &apos;s not sure it &apos;s as good as if we really did the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of that .
So what I &apos;m emoting to is really saying we had , for a long time , a very long time , a situation in which there &apos;s multiple choices .
There are many , many things we can do out there , but we didn &apos;t have the price , and we didn &apos;t have the price , and we didn &apos;t have the prices .
We didn &apos;t have an idea .
Imagine that we would take a restaurant and you have a huge letter , but you don &apos;t know what the prices are .
You know , you have pizza , but you don &apos;t know how it costs .
It could be a <unk> , they could be 1,000 dollars .
It could be a familiar pizza . It could be an individual pizza , right ?
I &apos;ll tell you these things .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to do the <unk> <unk> — it &apos;s to put the price of these subjects .
And so basically , this was the process of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 30 of the best economists in the world , three of every area .
In order to be three of the best economists on the planet &apos;s <unk> about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be their cost ? And what &apos;s good about it ?
The same thing with disease <unk> .
Three of the best specialists saying , what can we do ?
What is the price ?
What should we do about that , and what would the result ?
And so on .
So we took some of the best global economists , eight of the best economists in the world , including three <unk> <unk> , <unk> in May in May of 2004 .
So we call the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; The <unk> of Cambridge decided to <unk> the <unk> of the economy .
<unk> works very well in Europe , but here &apos;s not so much .
And basically what they did , was to get a <unk> list .
What economists do ?
And naturally , I &apos;m very happy to ask myself that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The theme is , of course , if you want to know malaria , ask you to know about malaria .
If you want to know about climate , questions to a <unk> .
But if you want to know what two you might solve first , you can &apos;t get rid of one of the two , because that &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what economists do .
<unk> .
They have to have this <unk> thing to say , that we have to do first , and we need to do after .
So this is the list , and this is the list that I &apos;m going to share with you .
Of course , you can also see the web , and I &apos;m sure it &apos;s also <unk> of it as a day .
Basically we had a list in which he said that there was a list of projects — basically , projects where I was going to get a <unk> , and we had fewer than a result as a result .
And then they were the same projects , the good ones and the <unk> .
And naturally , they are very good projects that we should start by doing .
I &apos;m going to start from the bottom of the way that we &apos;re going to end with the best projects .
These were the <unk> .
As you can see the end of the list is the climate change .
This offends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things that people will tell you should not be allowed to .
And I &apos;d like to talk about it , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why did it happen ?
And the truth , we also want to talk about this because it &apos;s probably one of the things we don &apos;t be according to the lists of lists .
The reason that resulted is the reason that it worked — or to make something more than <unk> — it &apos;s not a good business .
It doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s no global warming .
It doesn &apos;t mean a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying that what we can do for that is very little , a very high cost .
What we basically show us , the media , the media models , if all of the world had , if all the world had been according to a hundred billion of the year .
This is an important amount of money .
Twice or three times the global help of developing the world that we have been in the Third World every year .
And to do very little .
And all the models show that we were going to take a couple of years to <unk> .
So a guy in Bangladesh that we get a <unk> in the <unk> can expect to <unk> .
What &apos;s something well , but not very well .
So the idea and saying , well , we spend a lot of money doing something about it .
And just by giving a baseline , the U.N. estimates that over half of that amount , 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all the main problems in the world .
We could give clean water , sanitation , basic support and education to all human beings on the planet .
So we should be <unk> , we want to spend a very little way ?
Or the half of you do something that &apos;s good enough ?
And that &apos;s where it turns out to be a <unk> project .
It &apos;s not to say yes to all of the money in the world , you don &apos;t want to do it .
<unk> , that when we don &apos;t have , it &apos;s not our first priority .
The main projects — I &apos;m not going to comment on all of it — but some <unk> , scale of basic services — it &apos;s a little bit , just because it &apos;s , the scale of basic services is a big thing .
I &apos;m going to give you a lot of it , but it &apos;s also , but it &apos;s really <unk> .
Again , what it tells us and suddenly we started thinking about two sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , it &apos;s an awful lot of projects of sanitation .
Again , sanitation and water is really important , but it also costs a lot more infrastructure .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four <unk> priorities that should be , when they should be , at least , the first one to solve when we talk about how we should actually solve the problems of the world .
The bigger fourth is malaria — treat malaria .
<unk> malaria is about a couple of millions of people — every year .
It could even provide a <unk> point of GDP to the world for nations affected .
If we took a couple of millions of dollars in the next four years , we could reduce <unk> to half .
We could prevent the death of 500 people , but what perhaps is most important , we could prevent a billion people if we ate every year .
<unk> <unk> his ability to treat many of the other problems we have to deal with . Of course , in the long run , it &apos;s also the <unk> of global warming .
The third one is the free trade .
Basically , the model showed that if you were able to reach the free trade , and especially <unk> <unk> in the United States and Europe , we could basically rise to the global economy until the <unk> half of the year , half of the year of the Third World .
Again , we could actually take 200 or 300 million people from poverty , radically , very fast , between two and five years .
That would be the third thing that we could do .
The second thing was to be <unk> in <unk> .
We don &apos;t have any <unk> , but it &apos;s a very economic way to treat <unk> , is to say , the lack of <unk> .
Basically , the population of the world &apos;s population has made of iron , <unk> , <unk> and vitamin D A.
If we took 12 billion dollars , we could make a deep <unk> in that problem .
This would be the second best <unk> we could do .
And the best project was to be <unk> in HIV / AIDS .
Basically we &apos;ve invested 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could avoid 28 of new HIV .
Another time , what this does , and what makes it happen to say that we have two different ways how to treat HIV / AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is <unk> .
Again , in a ideal world , we did the two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t make any of the two or where we don &apos;t do it very well , we should , at least , asking where we should invest first .
And the treatment is much , much more expensive than <unk> .
So <unk> , what this meant was to say that we can make a lot more investing in the <unk> .
Basically we went to the amount of money that we can do it X in treatment , and 10 times more in <unk> .
So again , we have continued to figure out more than as treatment as the first option .
What this does is really meant to think about our priorities .
I &apos;m going to say to you like the list of <unk> and say , <unk> , <unk> ?
How do we get there ?
Well , <unk> , one of the things is again to <unk> climate .
<unk> a lot of people who think it &apos;s very , but we &apos;re very little likely to do that .
We also should make climate change , if there &apos;s no other reason , just because it &apos;s a big problem .
But naturally , we don &apos;t press all the <unk> .
We have many problems in the world .
And what I want to tell you is that if you focus on problems , we will take us further .
Those we can do a lot more better than a little bit .
And I think , the truth — Thomas <unk> , one of the subjects of <unk> <unk> , which explained very , very well .
One of the things that people <unk> , and that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking to the majority of the majority of climate change , people will be much more rich .
Even the most <unk> impacts of the U.N.
<unk> that a media person in the developing world will be as rich as we are today .
And much more likely , we are going to have two to four times richer than we are .
And naturally , we &apos;ll be even more rich than that .
But the thing is , when we talk about saving people , helping people in Bangladesh , we &apos;re not talking about a poor <unk> .
We &apos;re talking about a very rich <unk> .
And so the real topic , naturally , which is , we want to spend a lot of money to try to spend a little bit about a little bit .
or we want to help people the poor , or we want to help the poor people , these moments in Bangladesh , who need to really help people , and who can actually help <unk> ?
Or as the <unk> said , imagine , imagine rich rich — how will happen — a rich <unk> , a wealthy <unk> , a rich <unk> in <unk> thinking in 2005 in 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How do you get so much by taking a little bit on a little bit with this topic of climate change , and if you take it so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think what really tells us we need to put our priorities forward .
Even if you don &apos;t agree in the typical way to see this problem .
Of course , it &apos;s fundamentally because it &apos;s fundamentally because there &apos;s a climate change .
You know , we have <unk> El <unk> — it seems great , not ?
It &apos;s a good movie movie in the sense that I want you to see , right , but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to break it up to it in the next movie movie <unk> <unk> in Tanzania or something like this . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s not about a movie .
So in many ways , I think the <unk> <unk> and all the discussion about the priorities of the priorities is a defense of the multifaceted problems .
To make sure it &apos;s not just possible to make a good thing , and to make sure that it &apos;s not just possible to try to feel well .
It &apos;s not going to do the things that have the greatest <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s also going on to make places where we can actually make a bigger <unk> .
The other objections , I think , who are some important , is that some <unk> I &apos;m — or we &apos;re — we &apos;re going to give you a false choice .
Of course , we have to do it all in a very ideal world — it would completely agree .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t do it .
In 1970 , the developed world decided that we were going to spend twice what we &apos;ve done , right now , in 1970 in the developing world .
Like our help rise to half .
It doesn &apos;t seem like we &apos;re in the way to solve all the big problems .
In the same way , people also say , but there &apos;s the war in Iraq ?
You know , we spend 100 billion <unk> . So we &apos;re not going to do it in the world .
I &apos;m <unk> .
If some of you can talk to the Bush to do that , it &apos;s okay .
But of course the theme is not to say , that if you take other other 100 billion dollars , you would still want to get rid of the best possible way , right ?
So the real problem is to start and think of what &apos;s the appropriate priorities .
Could I mention briefly , is this really the wrong list ?
You know , when you ask questions to the best economists in the world , we &apos;re going to break it through the white men and old men from the United States .
And they &apos;re not necessarily a cool way to look at the entire world .
So let me add 80 to the 80 <unk> of the world to <unk> the same problem .
The only two requirements were that they were studying in college , and that &apos;s English .
Most of them were , first , in the developing world .
They had the same material , but they could have the same material of the topic of the discussion , as they really did , to <unk> their own lists .
And the amazing thing was that the list was very similarly — with <unk> and disease and disease , the end of the end .
We have done that many other times .
We had many other <unk> and students university and university students .
They all had as a result .
And that &apos;s about a big hope , really , to say that I think there &apos;s a way to start thinking about our priorities . And say , what &apos;s the most important of the world ?
Of course , in a ideal world , we &apos;re going to do it all .
But if we don &apos;t do all , we can begin to think about why ?
I see <unk> <unk> as a process .
We did in 2004 , and we hope to get a lot more people , to get a lot better data in 2008 , 2012 .
<unk> the way right to the world is right to the world , but also to start thinking about political <unk> .
To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t make the stuff where we can win a little bit with a high cost , and the things that we don &apos;t know how to do it , but we make it great things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but we have to be honest , but we have to be honest and <unk> to say , if there &apos;s some things that we do , we have others that we don &apos;t do .
If we don &apos;t care a lot about some things , I &apos;m going to try to worry about each other .
So I hope I hope this is helping us understand the priorities , and think about how we worked better for the world .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I was left outside the house without keys .
He had had to come home home to the house , and I was going to go home to a friend to the other side of the city of the city , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go home . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go home . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go home . &quot;
And I was in <unk> , looking forward and <unk> account that I had no keys .
In fact , I could walk through the window outside of the table table , where the <unk> .
But they were all <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t <unk> night in my friend &apos;s house because the morning I had a flight to Europe and had to be able to get the passport and <unk> .
So , desperate and <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> of the window to <unk> .
<unk> costs a lot of money but neither else has a <unk> in the middle of the night .
Well , I &apos;m going to tell you about neuroscience .
<unk> <unk> , that elevates the heart rate rate levels of the levels of adrenaline of adrenaline .
So the next morning when I stood up with me , I worried about the window of course , I worried about the window of course , and the <unk> that was going to be in Europe , and the <unk> that was going to be in Europe , and the <unk> that was going to be in Europe and the <unk> that was going to be in Europe and the <unk> that was going to be in Europe and the <unk> that was going to be in Europe .
And until I get out of the airport , I didn &apos;t think I was a passport .
So I went back to the house , with the snow and ice , in 40 minutes I took my passport , I came back at the time , but I &apos;m going to give my seat the other person to another person .
Or , in the case of the <unk> things , it &apos;s like <unk> things .
And Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me
It was something that <unk> from the <unk> , Gary <unk> that would take you about this was a few years ago , and it &apos;s also called <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a team of specialists who tries to determine what happens , right ?
Well , in the <unk> <unk> , like it explained by Danny , and then you try to determine what you can do .
What I want to talk about today is what we can do to talk about today is what we can do to do today .
A few things are obvious , some are not so much .
I &apos;m going to look at the course .
<unk> places all over home to the things that are going to be easily .
Well , this looks like common sense , and it &apos;s like this common sense of a common sense , and it &apos;s like this .
There &apos;s a structure of the brain , called the hippocampus that evolved for hundreds of thousands of years to remember how important things are , where it &apos;s the <unk> , where you can get rid of it , where they live the tribes and the sun .
The hippocampus is part of the brain .
It &apos;s the part of the brain .
In fact , there was been somebody who did the experiment of <unk> sense of <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , in fact , given somebody who did the experiment of the experience of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , in fact , given somebody who did the experiment of the experience of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , in fact , given somebody who did the experiment of the experience of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , in fact , given somebody who did the experiment of the experience of the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
But it works well with things that don &apos;t get too much and don &apos;t get too much .
So there &apos;s a lot of a place for the keys .
To the passport , a specific <unk> — the exercise of reading , a particular table .
If you look at a place , and if you take a place , you &apos;ll get the stuff to be in your place when you go .
And when you go to a <unk> ?
It &apos;s called an email with a photo of <unk> to the cloud .
These seem to be obvious .
Remember that when we &apos;re in stress , the brain emits <unk> .
<unk> is toxic and <unk> .
So you recognize that the stress won &apos;t go to the best of you and you should actually start to make a system .
I think when you take a medical decision .
Well , we &apos;re all right now in a situation in a situation in a situation where we &apos;re all right now in a situation in a situation where we &apos;re all in a situation in a situation .
And I want to talk about that .
or any decision that we need to do to do something that we need to do to do something that we need to do to do something we need to do to do something that we need to do .
Suppose you go to the doctor and this says , &quot; &quot; I have the results of the evidence , and it has the cholesterol results . &quot;
You know that the cholesterol button was high .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that it &apos;s not very good .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to ask a statistic of asking you to ask a statistic statistic .
It &apos;s the number we need to treat . &quot; &quot; And what &apos;s the <unk> ?
It &apos;s the number of people who have to <unk> medicine , and it &apos;s the number of people who are going to help a person .
And what about statistics is that ?
The number should be one . My doctor won &apos;t tell me something that we don &apos;t help .
But medicine doesn &apos;t work like this .
We don &apos;t know a lot about it .
<unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work between one 30 percent and 50 percent of the cases .
So the <unk> in the case of <unk> <unk> what you think is ?
How many people have to solve before they help somebody else ?
This second was the results of the results , and this second was the results of the results of this second .
I actually <unk> the data .
And it &apos;s called <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
In the case of this drug medicine , in the case of this drug medicine , in the case of this medicine , in the case of this medicine , in the case of this drug medicine , in the case of this drug medicine , in the case of this drug medicine , in the case of this drug medicine , in the case of this drug medicine , in the case of this drug medicine , in the case of this drug medicine , in the case of this drug medicine , in the case of this
And there include things like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ... ( <unk> , &quot; &quot; One <unk> . I don &apos;t believe me .
You have to be 15 times more likely to the drug you would eat .
I &apos;m not saying if you &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> or not just <unk> <unk> or not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; <unk>
You only have to have this conversation with your physician .
You have to have access to this information to be able to talk to you about to talk to you about to be able to talk to this information to be able to talk to you about to talk about this information to be able to talk about this information to be able to talk about this information to be able to talk about this information to be able to talk about it to be able to talk to this information to be able to talk about to you .
I &apos;m talking about this number to <unk> , but I &apos;m talking about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which
<unk> prostate cancer is 49 .
Yes , we &apos;ve done 49 <unk> per person who helps .
And the side effects of this case is based on 50 percent of patients .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So the idea of the <unk> <unk> has been able to make the conversation for the conversation .
The ideal is not to do this at the moment .
I also think about subjects like the quality of life .
These are things that we need to think now and coordinate with the family and loved ones .
Remember , under stress , the brain emits <unk> and one of the things that happens at that point is that if you have a lot of systems .
Darwinian evolution is that .
It &apos;s because if the body blows in these things , it &apos;s because if the body blows in these things , and you don &apos;t have a lot of it , because if the body blows in these things , and you don &apos;t have a lot of it , because if the body blows in these things , and you don &apos;t have a lot of it , because if the body blows in these things , and you don &apos;t have a lot of it , because if the body blows in these things and don
( Laughter ) <unk> , one of the things that you rely on if you &apos;re going to be able to figure out how to make it happen , you know , you know , you know how to do it , because it &apos;s called Danny Perasa and his colleagues .
So we need <unk> to think about this kind of <unk> .
I think the most important thing is to recognize that we all have <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> it .
The idea is to think about what they can be like to be these <unk> , starting systems that can minimize the damage or just prevent that these handbags <unk> .
<unk> the night with the snow of <unk> , and when I came back from the journey , I was going to talk to that night with the head of the house in the middle of the house and a easy code to remember .
They &apos;re not absolutely organized to be organized without organized <unk> .
Audience day !
Are they <unk> ?
Anybody ? No . Well , nothing .
The letter , please ?
You &apos;ll see <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Come on , you see , <unk> this !
It seemed like I &apos;d like you to talk to me , to talk to me , to talk to me , to talk to me .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just a completely fixed word that a young boy has a young <unk> .
How can you talk about this ?
At that point I started thinking .
There &apos;s a lot .
How do we get here ?

How do you <unk> ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , it &apos;s better to stop and let leave talk to you .
What I mean is that these things would take a specific <unk> .
I have a friend who speaks <unk> from a <unk> .
And once I asked her that he was all all .
And I said , &quot; &quot; All right , but I spent a time , but once I spent the entire day trying to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and said , &quot; &quot; All right , but I spent a time , but once I spent the old night trying to <unk> it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; All right , but I spent a time , but once I spent the old night trying to <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; All very good , but once

( Applause ) Well , what we did to protect the Arab language ?
And it turns out to become civil society .
But still , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Why are you ?
Mind this thing , and I &apos;m going to give you a good thing .
In the campaign to explore the Arab Spring : the next <unk> , the next <unk> : the next <unk> , the next <unk> , and in the campaign to preserve the next <unk> : the next <unk> , the next to the Arab Spring : the next <unk> , and in the campaign to preserve the next door , and in the campaign to the Arab Spring .
We don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have that style , because that way you don &apos;t get rid of it .
And when somebody talks like this , they hate the Arab .
<unk> ... ( Applause ) We realize we want to change our reality , and to be convinced of a way that brings our dreams , aspirations and day .
And I &apos;ll tell you how to view how we think about it .
After that <unk> photos of young and young girls with Arab characters .
<unk> of young and <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re very <unk> .
And anybody who says , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;ll give you a word in English ! ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I would call the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No ! I would call it .
I &apos;m going to follow saying the Internet .
or what they think they have authority about us , when they think they have authority about us , what they think they have authority about us , what they think they have authority about us , what they think they have authority about us , what they think they have authority about us , what they think they have authority about us , what they think they have authority about us , what they think they have authority about us , what they think they have authority about us , what they think they have authority about us
Their creativity in language is the way .
So let &apos;s start now .
One single novel sounds could have experienced other other time .
Could we take the Arab Earth again .
But we have to know , and I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s a solution , and that we have the <unk> of it .
So in short , what can we do right now ?
Let &apos;s see ... <unk> , who is <unk> ?
Please take it , even though my time has been <unk> , and please , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time has been <unk> , even though my time
But I don &apos;t write in Arabic and Latino characters with numbers .
( Applause ) So today &apos;s a <unk> !
I &apos;ve been working in a virtual world with a virtual language .
And it &apos;s not easy to go back from that world and <unk> .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
<unk> <unk> first his father was first to his father .
So when I saw my daughter , I said , &quot; &quot; This is a <unk> , my <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; This is a <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
What &apos;s happening in the head of baby ?
If we took this 30 years ago , most people , I would say that this baby is irrational , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — that I didn &apos;t have to account in the other person &apos;s perspective or not making a process of <unk> .
Over the last 20 years , the science science science was completely done this theory .
In a way , we believe that the thought of this baby is like the thought of this baby &apos;s thought of <unk> .
Take an example of this .
One thing I could be thinking of this baby , which could be the thought of this baby , which could be happening in the mind , is to address what &apos;s happening in the mind of another baby .
And finally , one of the most tough things , one of the most tough things for all of us is to address what other people think and feel .
And maybe the hardest thing to understand that others think and feel is not the same as what we think we think and feel .
Anyone who &apos;s so much of the policy can say how hard it comes to do this .
We wanted to know if babies and children can understand this very complex idea about other people .
So , the question is , how can we <unk> ?
Kids don &apos;t speak , and if we ask a three year-old child who tells us what you think , we &apos;re just going to make a <unk> <unk> of thinking about <unk> , <unk> and things .
How can we get it ?
It turns out that secret was the broccoli .
<unk> <unk> , one of my students , and I gave the babies two dishes with food : a <unk> <unk> and another <unk> <unk> <unk> .
All of the babies , even in Berkeley , I &apos;m enjoying the <unk> and I don &apos;t like the broccoli .
( Laughter ) So what he was doing was <unk> food &apos;s food to two dishes .
And he explained that he loved or not the <unk> .
Half of the times , they have to <unk> <unk> and not the broccoli — like any baby or normal person .
But the other half , I would take a little bit of <unk> and say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , broccoli .
<unk> the broccoli . <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then <unk> <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; I mean , they did it like you to understand the opposite of what I loved to the babies .
We did this with babies of 15 and 18 months .
So I would like you to <unk> your hand and say , &quot; Did you make a little bit ? &quot;
So , the thing was : Do you teach babies what I loved to them , or she ?
The surprising one was that the babies of 18 months , that &apos;s the end of the beginning , and talking , <unk> <unk> if you would take the <unk> and the broccoli if you eat the broccoli .
On the other hand , the babies from the 15 months of <unk> <unk> to her if he looked at the broccoli , as if I couldn &apos;t .
And after <unk> during a long mouse , <unk> <unk> , what thought I would like to like the whole world .
So there &apos;s two data on this .
On the one hand is that babies from 18 months , they have <unk> this role of human nature : we don &apos;t all want to do the same .
It &apos;s more , you understood that you have to act to help other people to get what they would .
And more interesting , more interesting , is that babies that babies are not doing this ; what suggests that the children of 18 months have been this profound to be the human being the human being human in the three months .
So babies know more and learn more than we &apos;re going to get to now .
And this is only one of the hundreds of studies that were made over over the last 20 years .
What if you can ask now is , why kids learning so much ?
And how can we learn how much such such as a little time ?
It &apos;s saying , the first view , babies are going to look quite like .
And often , they &apos;re worse , they &apos;re worse than <unk> , because we have to take a lot of time and energy just to keep living alive .
If we looked at evolution to try to look at this mystery of what we &apos;ve lost so much time to babies , it turns out that if there &apos;s a response to the answer to the babies .
If you look at different species , it &apos;s not just other <unk> like us , but it also also other <unk> , birds , even <unk> as the <unk> or the <unk> , it turns out there &apos;s a relationship between the <unk> and the relative size of the brain and intelligence .
One example of this <unk> of these birds that you can see here .
It &apos;s a <unk> of New York .
<unk> and other <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> birds , are very clever .
In certain ways they &apos;re as clever as the <unk> .
And this is a <unk> <unk> that has learned to use tools to get food .
On the other hand , we have to our domestic <unk> .
<unk> , like the ducks , <unk> and geese , are treated like stones .
It &apos;s very good <unk> , but it &apos;s not really good to do anything else .
It turns out that babies &apos; babies from New Yorkers , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , are going to the babies of the <unk> of New Yorkers , the <unk> , the <unk> , and it turns out that the babies from the <unk> of New Yorkers , the <unk> , the <unk> , is going to the babies of the <unk> of New Yorkers , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk>
They rely on their grieving on their mouth and the two years of life , which is a long time in the short life of a <unk> .
However , sovereign are an adult in just a couple of months .
In so much , it &apos;s the reason why the <unk> are going on in the <unk> of the scientific journals as the chickens are going to do in the pot of the soup .
There &apos;s something in the long way that it seems to be related to knowledge and learning .
What do we have to have to do this ?
Some animals , like chickens , seem to <unk> to do something very well .
So brands are very good <unk> in a particular environment .
Other creatures , like <unk> , they &apos;re not especially good , but they &apos;re very good at all , but they &apos;re very good to learn the norms of different environments .
And of course , humans , humans are very far in that distribution .
We have more big brains in our body , much more than any other animal .
<unk> smarter , more fluctuations , we can learn more , we can survive in many more environments : we have <unk> all over the planet .
And our babies and children rely on us for much more time that babies have other species .
My son has 23 .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) So even the 23 , we put the <unk> <unk> on his open mouths in his open mouths .
All right , why do we look at this discussion ?
One idea is that strategy , the strategy of learning , the strategy of learning , is a very powerful way of <unk> in this world . But it &apos;s a big <unk> .
It turns out that until they learns everything , if it works .
It wasn &apos;t going to be good at the <unk> <unk> and to be thinking , &quot; Do you want a <unk> or a <unk> ? &quot;
It might be better to know that before we get the <unk> .
And the way that evolution looks like this problem was , it seems to be , a division room .
So we have this period of time where we &apos;re totally <unk> .
We don &apos;t have to do nothing .
And then , of adults , we can take that that we &apos;ve learned about babies and children and they put it into practice for the world .
A way to think about this is that babies and children are small are like the <unk> Department and <unk> of the human species .
They &apos;re the people who are going to go back , and they &apos;re just going to go out and have good ideas , and we are the production and <unk> .
We have to take all of these ideas that we have learned from kids and <unk> in practice .
Another way of seeing it is , instead of thinking about babies and children as adults as adults , to think of them as being in a developing state of developing the same species — like <unk> and <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> , but the babies would be the <unk> <unk> of our own adults .
If this is true , if babies are designed to learn , and this story of evolution is showing us that the kids are to learn , we can expect to be a lot of powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the brain &apos;s brain seems to be the computer of the most powerful learning of the planet .
However , the real computers are getting a lot .
There &apos;s to be a revolution in our form of understanding the machines .
And all of this guy , the ideas of this man , the <unk> Thomas <unk> , a statistical and mathematician <unk> .
Basically we did it provided a mathematical process that tells you the theory of the probability of the probability and describe the way that scientists will be able to apply things in the world .
What scientists do is <unk> a hypothesis , something that we could start .
Then we would take that chance with evidence .
The evidence would change change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence will change the hypothesis , and the evidence
What you &apos;re doing is that they are going to be able to do it with new tests , and then we get it .
What <unk> showed was a mathematician <unk> that could do that .
And math is the basis of the best programs of learning that we have today .
Ten years ago , I would argue that babies will be doing the same .
If you want to know what &apos;s happening under these beautiful <unk> <unk> , I think it &apos;s something very much like that .
At the end of the <unk> <unk> .
I think babies are doing very complicated calculations with <unk> <unk> that <unk> and so <unk> how the world works .
Well , this is even more difficult to prove .
If we ask an adult about statistics , it might feel pretty stupid .
How is it possible that kids make statistics ?
To test this , we brought a machine that we gave the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a toolbox that lights and sound sounds like it &apos;s filled with it .
By using this machine , in my lab , and in my lab , and also in other , if we tested dozens of studies of research on the world .
We &apos;re just one we did with <unk> <unk> , one of my students .
If you look at this detector , you probably would have <unk> by thinking that the way of <unk> is to put a <unk> on the detector .
But the case is that detector work in a very much way .
If you look at a <unk> on the detector , something that doesn &apos;t take place in a principle , the detector is based on two of every three times .
We thought that if we put the <unk> on top of them , which would be logical , only about two of every six times .
So , there is so much more likely to think more obvious .
It looks like the strategy of <unk> the object is more than the other .
So we explain this data to the children of four years and <unk> that <unk> .
And with security , the children were four and the age of the data , and we get the object over the detector .
There are two interesting data in this fact .
The first one , <unk> who are kids about four years ago , and the first one , <unk> who are children for four years ago , and the first one , <unk> who are children for four years ago , and the first one , <unk> who are children for four years ago , and the first one , <unk> who are children for four years ago , and the first one , <unk> who are children for four years ago , and the first one , <unk> who are children for four years ago .
They are learning to count ; they are learning to count .
But unconsciously they are doing complex calculations that give them a measure of <unk> .
The second thing is interesting to be interesting is that they &apos;re using the evidence to get an idea , a hypothesis about the world , which seems something a little bit likely to think at principle .
In research that we rely on the laboratory , other similar , we &apos;ve shown that these children of four are the best possible skills to the adults , given the same task .
In these projects , kids make statistics to <unk> things about the world , but scientists experience , after all , after all , and we wanted to see if kids were too much .
It &apos;s what we usually call &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; It has arisen a lot of interesting studies lately lately that these games are like a kind of research program .
<unk> one of the laboratory <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> kids who <unk> <unk> are going to work , and the red won &apos;t , with a malfunction .
So what we &apos;ll see now is this boy <unk> five hypotheses in two minutes of time .
Audience : And so ?
Man : Just on the other side .
<unk> : Well , the first <unk> hypothesis .
Man : Nothing .
<unk> : begins to describe <unk> .
( Video ) Child : Why do this ?
( Laughter ) Man : Don &apos;t .
<unk> : The scientists will recognize that face of <unk> .
( Laughter ) Man : Oh , it &apos;s because this has to be like this , and this has to be like this .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
Audience : So it has to be .
Man : Oh ... can &apos;t be .
( Laughter ) <unk> : Now it comes the next .
It &apos;s called the researcher that we were going to put on top of the other .
Nothing worked .
Man : Oh , it &apos;s because light only goes up to here , not until here .
Well , this box is electricity , but this doesn &apos;t have .
<unk> : Well , that would be the fourth one .
Audience : OK .
If you put it four <unk> .
If you put four <unk> in this , you &apos;ll take it and two to two to the other .
<unk> : Well , that &apos;s the chance .
This child is — it &apos;s a very <unk> child and <unk> , but <unk> found that it &apos;s a very typical child .
If you look at how kids play kids , if you &apos;re asking you to find something , what do you do is to experiment .
Very typical age of four .
Well , what do you feel like this kind of creature ?
What if you feel a <unk> of these <unk> can test five hypotheses ?
If you look at theory of psychologists and philosophers , a lot that babies and kids are conscious , or even though they &apos;re not conscious .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think babies and children are more aware of the adults .
This is what we know about how an adult works .
The awareness and attention of an adult looks like a focus .
What happens in the adults is that when we decide something is important , or relevant , <unk> attention .
Now , the awareness of this is what it turns out to become <unk> and intense , as the rest of us are going to do .
We also know how it happens in the brain .
When we can pay attention to something , the frontal part of the brain , the part of the brain , the part of the brain that makes a little part of the brain if you &apos;re <unk> , if you &apos;re more <unk> , better to learn ; and all of the activity in the rest of the brain .
We have this <unk> <unk> , right now .
If you look at babies and kids , you see something very different .
I think babies and kids seem to have a more <unk> of a torch .
We spend babies and kids spend a lot of systematic attention to one thing .
But it really discouraged me very well to have a lot of information in a lot .
And if you look at your brains , what you see is that they &apos;re <unk> from <unk> to learning and plasticity , and you don &apos;t get the cable .
So when we say babies that babies and kids have problems to pay attention , what really means is they &apos;re not paying attention .
<unk> <unk> of the interesting things that you might expect to say something about it is important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of awareness that we need to expect from those <unk> that are going to be able to learn .
If we want to think of a way to feel that kind of infant awareness as adults , I think the best way is to think about cases we are before a new situation in which we didn &apos;t have never been before ; every time we &apos;re going to find somebody , or when we go to a city for the first time .
<unk> cases is not <unk> , but it &apos;s expanding , so it turns out that in three days in Paris , there &apos;s more awareness and experiences that every month back in the house , walking up , speaking , going on .
So for some coffee , that magnificent coffee that we take below , actually increase the effect of the <unk> of babies .
So how is a baby ?
It &apos;s like to be boyfriend in Paris , for the first time , after <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) A wonderful feeling , but that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the morning . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s an adult .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about the <unk> that are the babies .
It &apos;s an adult .
We can do things like <unk> .
And it has sense that we pretend a lot of effort to do that babies think as adults .
But what we want to do is to be like these <unk> , having the open mind , being open to learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , innovation , innovation , maybe at least as the adults think a little bit like kids .

The genocide is not just <unk> ; it &apos;s the denial of identity identity .
There are always hints .
They have always been <unk> of the <unk> that would take care more than their bodies will kill or that our <unk> and cold memory .
These are <unk> objects of a lot of common <unk> and the objective of objects that disappeared in the first act of genocide in Europe from the Holocaust of the Holocaust .
No body should be able to be able to discover or without any <unk> .
Once if you look at these objects that victims would take their way to their <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> are going to <unk> these objects that victims would take their way to their <unk> <unk> .

A few years ago , I decided to take a <unk> object to make a visual archive to create a visual archive that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I like to promote <unk> <unk> .
And in this case , <unk> can recognize objects or at this case , <unk> can recognize objects or at least that the photos are like to be .
The photograph is empathy and the familiarity of these <unk> objects .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , a forensic tool , if you want to , and the result is the most kind of possible .
When you look at the most of the most <unk> bodies and these physical objects and the ordinary ones , the ordinary ones — when you get to the ones that are going to get the most <unk> bodies and these physical objects , when you look at it as if you &apos;re going to get rid of the most <unk> bodies and these physical objects , when you look at it as if you &apos;re going to get rid of the most <unk> bodies and these physical objects , when you look at it , they &apos;re going

There are some things I &apos;ve learned with these challenges of 30 days .
I had a long time that the months I had failed to fly , <unk> , if I wasn &apos;t a lot more memorable .

I &apos;m here to share my picture .
This is photograph ?
Because of course , this is a picture that can &apos;t take place with their cameras .
With all , my interest in picture began when I was going to <unk> my first tiny camera at the 15 years .
<unk> with my previous passion and the print , it was a little bit different , because by using the process of the process was more well in the planning .
And when you look at a picture of a photo with a camera , the process finishes when you get the <unk> .
To me , I had more to look more than to be in the <unk> place at the time .
I &apos;m sure anybody could do it .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process would get to the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> like this : a whole building on a very <unk> road .
But it has an unexpected gyrus .
And despite this , it keeps a level of realism .
Or photos like this — dark and colorful , but all of the common objective of keeping the level of realism .
When I &apos;m saying , I &apos;m sorry .
Because of course , it &apos;s not something that can actually be captured but I always want to look like it was captured in a picture .
<unk> what one will have to think a moment to discover the magic .
So this one has more to see with capturing a thought that we really can .
But what is the trick that does real look like ?
You have to see the details or the colors ?
You have to see the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
And the point of view is the illusion .
But at the end of our way of interpreting the world &apos;s way to interpret the world and how it can be <unk> on a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s really not is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
So I think the basics are very easy .
I &apos;m just like a <unk> of reality in which we take different pieces of reality and <unk> to create an alternative reality .
Let me show you an example .
So here we have three physical objects , <unk> , something that we all relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
But combined in a way you can create something that &apos;s still three-dimensional — as if you &apos;re going to be there .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t exist .
So we <unk> our brain because the brain doesn &apos;t surprise the fact that it has really no sense .
And I see the same process by combining photos .
It &apos;s really about combining different realities .
So the things that make a picture seems to realistic realistic realistic realistic realistic , I think they are the ones that we don &apos;t even think — the things that we don &apos;t even think about it .
But when we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to have to account this . Because of the reverse <unk> .
So I &apos;d like to say that there &apos;s three simple approaches that we went to an <unk> results .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But combined , you can create something like this .
So the first <unk> is that the photos combined with the same perspective .
Secondly , the photos combined with the same kind of light .
And these two images are disrespectful to these requirements ; they &apos;ve got them at the same time and the same type of light .
The third point is to make it worthwhile to tell where they start and do the different imagery with a perfect <unk> .
It has to be impossible to say how to <unk> the picture in reality .
It &apos;s called the color of color , the contrast and the <unk> in the <unk> that there is between the different images , by allowing them to <unk> <unk> as long as the field of the field , and it looks like a single picture , despite the fact that a single picture actually could have hundreds of layers .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) I mean , I mean , this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom part is what &apos;s manipulated .
But this picture is completely written by photos of different places .
I think it &apos;s easier to create a place that <unk> , because you don &apos;t need to compromise the ideas that you have in your head .
But this requires a lot of planning .
And as I thought this idea in winter , I knew I had several months to design , to find different places for the bits of the <unk> .
For example , the fish was captured on an exit .
The back is a different shot .
The <unk> part was taken in a stone <unk> .
And yeah , even I &apos;ve done the house of the <unk> of the island to <unk> <unk> .
So for a result , you can actually realistic realistic .
It always starts with a <unk> , an idea .
So we &apos;ve got the different photos .
And there &apos;s a piece of a piece of <unk> .
If a good thing has a good job to take the photos the result can be very beautiful and again .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that &apos;s is is our imagination .
Thank you .
