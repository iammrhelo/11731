( Arabic ) <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> . In the name of Allah , <unk> .
( Laughter ) <unk> <unk> in a family class .
My father was five years when he lost his father , but when I was <unk> , he was a business guy .
If their children were children or girls , they were going to go to school .
So I suppose I was <unk> .
My mother was <unk> 16 times .
Of the 16 <unk> , we &apos;re alive .
You can imagine why I had to happen when I was a girl .
<unk> , she watched women being transported to the <unk> , or children being taken to a <unk> .
At that moment , when I graduated high school , I mean I wanted to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I gave my education to me , to go to university .
<unk> , in my country , there was no <unk> for women in the <unk> while , although I had to <unk> in school of medicine , couldn &apos;t go .
As a result of my father <unk> America .
I watched America .
One of my studies .
Whereas by my education , Russia <unk> my country .
You know ? When I was finishing my training , I wondered what was happening to my family and my country .
<unk> months , and I didn &apos;t know .
My family was a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So in the corner , I came back to my family , my family .
I wanted to help them .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when you look at the news , when you still get the bad news in my country , your heart .
I &apos;d like to go back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t go because there was no place for me .
She had a good job .
It was a university .
<unk> .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
We live with them .
So it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted my home .
So we went to the field of <unk> .
And when I arrived at the <unk> of <unk> , there was seven million and half a <unk> .
<unk> , 70 percent were women and children â€” most of the men or died in war or were in it , and they know ?
When he was , when he was , he did it with things that didn &apos;t <unk> .
And I watched a widow with five and eight kids , there , sitting there , without knowing it .
I watched a new woman who didn &apos;t have to go on where to go , without studies , not income , and a place we live .
And I watched kids who have lost their parents , their <unk> , and that with 10 or sweet years , had to find out of their families , to be the head of family and trying to protect their own siblings , their efforts and children .
The situation was absolutely <unk> .
My heart and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
In that moment , it turns out a impulse .
In that moment , I felt : I can do these people ?
How can I ?
I &apos;m a one person , I can do for them ?
But at that moment , I knew that education was my life .
<unk> . <unk> .
<unk> trust . <unk> a career .
I was getting back in the back of my family , starting my family to another country , so they were safe .
And at the moment I knew that what I was supposed to provide my people was education and health and that was what we could do .
But think was easy ?
Because of that , women did not have access to education .
Beyond , after the <unk> of Russia in Afghanistan , people had no longer <unk> .
It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot;
Somebody comes from the United States .
Anyone who <unk> here .
<unk> in me ? We should not .
So what was really needed was to win the confidence of this community .
How am I going to do it ?
I went , I watched , I watched and watched .
I &apos;ve done questions .
In the end , I found a man .
She was 80 .
It was a <unk> .
I went to his tent in <unk> and <unk> the proposal , &quot; &quot; I want to tell you a teacher . &quot;
And he <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , crazy , how do you think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get you a teacher . &quot; &quot; And finally I started with a guy in his <unk> , and instead I started with a man in his <unk> , I would tell her voice .
Last year , we had 25 schools going up , 15,000 children going to school , and it was incredible .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
And of course , we were doing our work , learning teachers , <unk> in rights of women , rights , human rights and laws and laws , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
One day , I was in the <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and one day , I was in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and one day , I was in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and one day , I was in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and one day , I was in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and one day , I was in <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and one day , I was in
So , suddenly , I saw that all my personal staff was in the rooms , and suddenly I saw that all my staff was in the rooms , and then he opened the doors and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And he said , the question , what do you do ?
You have fear . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know , your life is in play .
But as a leader , you have to keep <unk> .
You have to maintain the <unk> and showing the fortress .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And those people stopped the mass of my office .
So the conclusion is coming into the office .
They were nine , nine , nine .
They were the most knowledgeable men who can see never .
( Laughter ) People with a <unk> <unk> , black black , <unk> black , and molded in mass in my office .
And I &apos;d like to sit and take a tea .
<unk> . It won &apos;t go to tea .
And of course , the strength of voice that <unk> was a lot of fear , and I was really impaired .
But at the same time , let me <unk> .
And of course , of course , at the moment , you &apos;ll see how far , I &apos;m going to have a black armband for a black armband .
The only one I saw was the eyes .
He said , &quot; &quot; What do you ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t know the school <unk> <unk> for women ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And what do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And he grabbed the face and I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s the house of somebody . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s the house of somebody .
They come a few students . We all teach the Koran , the holy book .
You know ? The Koran says that if you had the holy book of women , women can be good wives and they can obey their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what it &apos;s like with that people . ( Laughter ) At that moment , you want to talk to you .
<unk> among them and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , is okay , &quot; &quot; and they know ? &quot; &quot; And you know ? So I &apos;ll give you them again and get a <unk> and <unk> .
So my personal staff stopped my office .
They were killed .
Don &apos;t know why I didn &apos;t care about me .
Don &apos;t know why I don &apos;t care about them .
With all of all of the worm of the worm .
Pretty happy and , of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) And of course , it would be alive .
But also , by follow <unk> during the fall of <unk> , when the <unk> had the power was another story .
<unk> in <unk> and <unk> the 80 girls , three students reported , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
With the fall of <unk> , we went through the country and we open a school after another .
We opened schools centers for women .
We opened clinical clinics without stop .
We work with women and children .
<unk> about health <unk> .
You know how many types of training can imagine .
I was very happy . I was <unk> with a result of my work .
And one day , when I was going to come up with four educators and a record , I went to the north of Kabul , suddenly one more time , <unk> at the middle of the road , was 19 .
So when it comes back to the back , the road opened the road .
So I explained to my driver that happened and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing to see you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s nothing to see you . &quot; &quot; So my name came out and said , &quot; &quot; I can <unk> .
What do we want ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; They said nothing .
At that moment , women would come inside the car .
I &apos;m very impaired and <unk> : &quot; &quot; This is the end . &quot;
This time , let me kill everyone .
I had no doubt .
But yet , when the moment comes , I &apos;m going to get the forces of everything you think and what you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
<unk> in your <unk> and you can move through that .
So I put myself on one side of the car .
My leg was <unk> .
He said , &quot; &quot; How can I go ? &quot; &quot; You know what I do ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it goes .
Come on every day in a place .
<unk> women , <unk> , and also gives us the chance to have a job .
<unk> . What about it ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; What about it ?
What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; <unk> and <unk> , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay .
We know , the only one we can do , for the time in which we launched a gun and kill it .
We don &apos;t know more . &quot; &quot; And they know what it means .
Obviously , it was a trap .
And then they said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I walked into the car , I sat back , and I said to the driver , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .
We just had money to get rid of them , to get them to school , and nothing else .
When I came to the office , we obviously all the <unk> educators .
You get their houses . Nobody was .
My warden was the only one that I was there and I had no voice .
I was <unk> , sitting in my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to do this problem ?
Because they &apos;ve had education in the north .
Hundreds of women came back to the <unk> .
So I was there , and suddenly , now , now , we &apos;re here talking about pulses , because , at the moment , one of my wonderful wonderful favorite <unk> was a report .
And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And I wrote .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . What do you go ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
It was the same thing , I didn &apos;t believe me and still asking .
&quot; &quot; Okay , tell me that &apos;s happening . &quot;
<unk> all the story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for the next , you &apos;re going to go and <unk> them .
<unk> . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I &apos;ve done the same way , know what ? There was not there , were a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the
So I stopped the car .
<unk> and I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay to me . &quot; &quot; And said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; Well , <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , <unk> .
So over the mosque and to sum up , I had to go to the mosque .
Now they are the best teachers .
I &apos;m interested in English , learning how to be teachers , and I &apos;m my <unk> .
All the areas we don &apos;t know , in the mountain lanes , they come to me . They go back and go .
And they &apos;re <unk> .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
So the education changes the people .
When we <unk> people , they change and , in today , we need to work for equality .
You can &apos;t raise women and <unk> men , because men are the people who are going to be more difficult to women .
( Laughter ) So we started to <unk> , because they have to be conscious of the potential of women , to know how they have men and those women are going to find the same jobs they have .
So we form long-term men and I think deeply deeply , and I think profoundly , and I think it &apos;s deeply that we form continuously and I think profoundly , and I think it &apos;s deeply that we form forever , and I think it profoundly , and I think it &apos;s deeply that we form forever , and I think it profoundly , and I think that we form forever , and I think it profoundly , and I think it &apos;s deeply that we form forever , and I think it profoundly , and I think
I live in a country that I live in a country who live in a country who was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was a beautiful country , beautiful and peaceful country .
<unk> all the parts .
The women <unk> education : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> â€” and we went from a house to another .
Don &apos;t get the doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get rid of the security problems .
But we still want Afghanistan before .
And I want to tell you the other part .
Now , women in Afghanistan work very , very hard .
<unk> . <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> to be <unk> again again .
<unk> to be <unk> and unconscious .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people use their potential , and it &apos;s going to happen .
I want to share with you for the love of compassion , by compassion , and by the trust .
If you have these things , they &apos;re successful .
We have a poet , <unk> <unk> .
He said that if you have compassion and if you have love , you can build the world .
And we found ourselves .
And if we were living in Afghanistan , I &apos;m safe to 100 percent than any of the world .
Thank you , many , many .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Ten years ago I got a phone call that changed my life .
So I was <unk> at UCLA at UCLA &#91; University of California , Los Angeles of the heart version .
( Laughter ) So when I was a <unk> <unk> from Los Angeles .
An old <unk> <unk> <unk> with facial <unk> and <unk> <unk> that was a brain <unk> .
I &apos;d like to go to the zoo I could go to the zoo to search for a better possible cause .
We were going to let it be clear that the United States of the United States is that with <unk> <unk> <unk> and highly likely to take care of their patients &apos; patients .
But sometimes , I &apos;m going to tell you to the medical community , especially for some medical visit , but sometimes I would argue that the medical community , especially for a lot of a <unk> , but sometimes I would argue that the medical community , especially for a lot of a <unk> , but sometimes I would argue that the medical community , especially for a lot of a medical doctor , especially for a lot of a trade .
<unk> <unk> the brain <unk> in the case of this <unk> <unk> in the case of this <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and doctors told me that the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and doctors found in the <unk> of the bag of <unk> and doctors in a <unk> , a collaborative , <unk> , <unk> , and doctors in a <unk> , and doctors told me that I was in this photo , <unk> the heart of a
And this process , that , in many humans , was <unk> , the exception of that <unk> and that glue .
<unk> symptoms , diagnostics and treatments for my patients &apos; patients ; they &apos;re going to be able to pay for their patients to their patients .
And when instead , at the same day , he turned into the University of UCLA Medical Center and in Los Angeles .
And I started to see clearly one thing : &quot; &quot; And I just started to see one thing .
basically , doctors and <unk> <unk> the same diseases in their patient , basically , doctors and expose themselves to the same diseases in their patients , and animals , diabetes , <unk> , malleability lateral <unk> , <unk> cancer , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Well , I have to share a <unk> .
But I &apos;ve studied the physiology compared to university biology during college â€” even I &apos;ve done my senior thesis on the <unk> of Darwin â€” learning more about the significant <unk> of Darwin â€” learning more than me .
And I started complaining about how she could be , with all of these <unk> , who would never have imagined a <unk> or <unk> <unk> to have another point about one of my humans ?
Did you never be a <unk> conference ?
But even more , why should it be ?
All doctors will provide some biological connections between animals and human beings .
All the drugs that we prescribe , we take or we give our own families in it before in a animal .
But there &apos;s a big difference between giving a drug a drug or a drug or a human disease , and that animal will take a human heart , diabetes or cancer .
If it was , part of the surprise of the growing separation that our world makes between urban and not urban .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about those kids who think that <unk> grows in the trees , or the cheese comes from a plant .
Hospitals humans today , there &apos;s going to transform more and more than the <unk> .
And this creates a <unk> gap between human patients who are treated and the animals that live in the oceans , in the <unk> and in the jungles .
But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : I
doctors and scientists were crushed for their species , the Homo sapiens , it &apos;s just a species , and there &apos;s not a species , and there &apos;s no one species .
But in our interior we don &apos;t end up .
I &apos;m going to give me myself when I <unk> Mozart or I see in my <unk> the photos he did Mars .
I feel that he called the human <unk> , but even <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> species .
Well , yeah , but this is <unk> .
Now , when I see a human patient , I always ask myself : What know doctors of animals about this problem I don &apos;t know ?
So , more : Could I do better to think better to my human patient if you had a human animal patient ?
And there are some examples from the <unk> connections that led me this kind of <unk> .
<unk> heart <unk> for fear .
In the year 2000 , the <unk> of humans have found that &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; â€” Allah , Allah , humans . &quot;
It was described in a <unk> father in the game that lost the savings of the entire life in a face of data , in a <unk> <unk> .
But it turns out that this &quot; &quot; new , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s a new human diagnosis .
<unk> used to <unk> <unk> , trying to even <unk> symptoms by <unk> <unk> in animals , from monkeys to <unk> them , from the 1970s .
How many human lives could be used if this knowledge was going to be in the basis of medical doctors and <unk> ?
<unk> .
There are some human patients themselves .
You know , if you cut it .
Some patient patients are also going to get themselves .
There &apos;s a <unk> that <unk> <unk> and over again .
But <unk> , they have very specific ways that they &apos;re trying to treat and even prevent the <unk> in the animals that have come back .
Wouldn &apos;t it be this knowledge <unk> to the <unk> of the fathers and the patient and the patients who are fighting with them ?
<unk> <unk> and psychosis <unk> .
Sometimes , as a little bit of giving the light a few women in depression , sometimes in depression , and even in states .
You can send it to their own son , and they can get to <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> knows that when I was a <unk> , a little bit after the house , he can send her <unk> , and he was going to <unk> it , and in some cases , I fell down to <unk> .
But <unk> <unk> a treatment to address this syndrome of the <unk> <unk> syndrome that we &apos;re increasing oxytocin .
Oxytocin is the hormone of the <unk> , and it causes it into a renewed interest in its <unk> .
Wouldn &apos;t it be this data at the end of the <unk> and <unk> , the family doctors and the patient &apos;s doctors and the patient <unk> ?
And despite the fact that it &apos;s all the way , the distance between our honeymoon goes .
To <unk> , a lot of me , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to put some evidence .
There are doctors who can be <unk> by the donors who are not <unk> in medicine .
I mean to <unk> , <unk> and psychologists , but especially to <unk> .
And of course , most of the doctors have no idea that it &apos;s more difficult to enter today in a <unk> <unk> than a <unk> , and when we go to medicine we learned everything that &apos;s relevant to know about a species , Homo sapiens .
So I didn &apos;t blame the <unk> by <unk> by <unk> <unk> and the ignorance of my profession .
Here &apos;s a punchline of the part of the <unk> : How if he &apos;s called a little bit of a species ?
Doctor <unk> this gap has become in my passion , and I &apos;m doing it through programs like Darwin on <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> that <unk> the specialists in animals and biologists <unk> and <unk> our doctors to <unk> our own social and residents .
And through the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> Medicine and <unk> to remain collaborative arguments on the disease and evidence-based disorders and animals .
In <unk> participants participants who teach us how the treatment of a chest cancer is in one of your chest disease can help care of the heart of a child education .
At <unk> <unk> , first in America , and now all around the world , doctors and <unk> leave their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them like colleagues like the doctors .
In the end , humans are also animals , and it &apos;s now a time that we have , doctors , physicians , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Because it turns out that some of the best and more <unk> medicine are being tracked by doctors who have patients who are not humans .
And one of the best way to treat the human patient is to make a lot of attention as all the other patients in the planet , and they are and they grow and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) Here the key word is . &quot; &quot; <unk> !
( Applause ) <unk> brain brain was , as you can imagine , and you can imagine , if you can imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if you might imagine , if
I didn &apos;t know about the <unk> .
In the dark cultures , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have a <unk> , when you have <unk>
Life , of a complex human being , is replaced by medical data : your <unk> , the medical test , the results of the lab , the list of medicine ...
Suddenly it &apos;s a disease with legs .
Doctors start talking about a language that you don &apos;t have .
It took the piece of your finger your body and your <unk> .
People starts to change also because it begins to treat disease instead of the person .
He said , &quot; &quot; What do you say the doctor ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you say ? &quot; &quot; As long as I said , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; As much , I wonder with questions that nobody has reply .
Do you want to do that ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m able to work with <unk> ?
Do I have to study ? How love you study ? Is it creative ?
He said , &quot; &quot; What did I do to hate this ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I can change something in my style of life ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s something you can do ?
There &apos;s some other choice ? &quot; &quot; And of course , doctors are the kinds of good ideas in all of these cases , because they &apos;re very fraught and engaged with <unk> .
But they &apos;re also used to deal with patients , which I would say to sometimes lose the point of view that for you is a torture , and that &apos;s literally in a patient . &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; what you expect . &quot;
( Laughter ) Things are sure , but the typical thing is , but the typical thing is that <unk> <unk> from any way to know your own family , to make it to your family family and friends or some way to modify your style of life to minimize the risks of what you &apos;re going to happen .
But with all of you , there &apos;s a lot to wait in your hands of a very identity of unusual style .
Whereas the hospital was in the hospital , I asked me to get me down to my <unk> .
It was very difficult , because it &apos;s not a lot of a photo of your own <unk> .
I talked to him and I said , &quot; &quot; Very good , <unk> , you don &apos;t <unk> me .
I &apos;m more like this .
So the cure is , will have to deal with all of my being . &quot; &quot; So by the next day , I was able to deal with the entire hospital .
I was decided to change my relationship with the <unk> , and I decided to learn more about it before he had a surgery .
It &apos;s an artist , using several types of technologies of open , open data into my work .
So my great bet was spreading all the way , opened the data , and do it so that any way that any could be made it .
So I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La <unk> . &quot; &quot; So I created a website .
In fact , I had to <unk> , but that subject can talk to another talk .
( Laughter ) <unk> this word , &quot; &quot; La <unk> , &quot; &quot; because in the Italian means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; because in many cultures , the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; can have many meanings .
In our Western culture , it means to eradicate or uncomfortable to the disease , but in other cultures like for example , the Mediterranean , of the Mediterranean , or Africa , can represent many other things .
And of course , I was interested in the opinion of the doctors and the rest of health care , but also interested in the <unk> proposal by the performer , by the poet , by the <unk> , or not , by musicians .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it worked .
The site La <unk> around the world .
I &apos;m going to get a lot of <unk> on Italy and the <unk> and more of 500,000 people <unk> me in a very little time through emails , social media ... Most of them were <unk> of how to cure my own <unk> , but many more were about how to <unk> me as a person .
For example , <unk> thousands of videos , images , photos and <unk> figments to La <unk> .
Here &apos;s the example of Francesca <unk> and his <unk> .
Or what did the artist Patrick <unk> <unk> : <unk> was a 3D sculpture of my tumor and <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Now you can also have my <unk> !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s something great , you can share the same <unk> .
And this was what was happening : scientists , international medicine , traditional medical medicine , doctors â€” all were connected to me .
Given all of this data and support , I was able to collect a <unk> team of competitive , traditional doctors , <unk> , and a few hundreds of thousands of people I could talk about the data that I could talk about the data that would kill me , which is very important .
<unk> , we &apos;ve been able to formulate a strategy of mine in different languages and how different cultures .
So , the current strategy is <unk> the whole world and thousands of years of human history , and the thing that I find quite amazing .

So I could take my time to exist .
I put the doctor on what I wanted to work with , I would argue the hospital in which I wanted to be , and all of the people who had me missed me without it .
Everybody felt that I could be <unk> <unk> <unk> , and this was the most important part of La <unk> .
What was the results ?
I &apos;m okay , as you can see , very well .
( Applause ) <unk> bad news after surgery : I have â€” I have â€” it had â€” a very low <unk> <unk> , which is a good thing .
It was completely my life and my own lifestyle .
It was very intense , it was really intense , had a <unk> network network in my brain on this side , to build a functional map of what the brain controls .
And just before the operation , we were able to look at this map with a doctor to understand the risks that was going to run , and if there was some of me who had to avoid .
Obviously , <unk> .
This was the real principle of La <unk> .
People are sharing their stories , their experiences .
The doctors came to talk to people who don &apos;t tell me when it &apos;s about <unk> .
<unk> me , I &apos;m a <unk> state of translation between a lot of different languages , where the science is in emotion and the conventional research .
&#91; <unk> &#93; The key point of La <unk> was <unk> part of a truly committed society and connected , <unk> well-being , global well-being .
This <unk> <unk> is my <unk> open code for <unk> .
( Applause )
I don &apos;t have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I couldn &apos;t even say what it &apos;s until we were to <unk> .
I wasn &apos;t sure he was going to be a little bit of music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I &apos;ve had to listen .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , before nothing , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the return , ( Applause ) <unk> Travis at the bottom , and the Christian Christian .
<unk> , as we call it , is an incredible space .
It &apos;s a holy place .
And one of the things that drives the holy is that you don &apos;t give us the opportunity to think about the future , or in the past .
You &apos;re really alive right now .
You have to take a lot of decisions when it goes to <unk> .
We didn &apos;t have no idea what we were moving .
So a <unk> of a song called &quot; &quot; <unk> Crowd . &quot; &quot; But that could happen or not .
All listening . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for the ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : from the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s more easy to talk about the error of somebody else &apos;s error .
The way I &apos;m asking a mistake when I &apos;m in <unk> â€” before nothing , we don &apos;t see it as a mistake .
The only mistake I &apos;m going to do is they &apos;re not able to figure out what else is .
Every mistake is an opportunity to jazz .
Even it &apos;s hard to describe what it would be like .
For example , if I &apos;m painting a color , like if I &apos;m playing with the palette , we had sonar like this ...
( Music ) If Christian rings â€” like <unk> . ( Music )
You see , it &apos;s all fit in the palette of colors .
If it plays E .
You see , it &apos;s all possible in the interior of this emotional palette that we &apos;re painting .
And yet if you touch <unk> . ( Laughter ) Most of you will hear a mistake .
You &apos;re going to look at a moment .
And we &apos;re going to play in this palette .
<unk> moment , Christian will add this bill .
And we won &apos;t respond to it .
They &apos;re going to play for a second , and then let me stop and talk a moment .
We &apos;re going to see what happens when we touch with this palette .
( Music ) <unk> , somebody could describe it as a mistake .
I would just say it &apos;s about a mistake if I couldn &apos;t afford it .
A lost opportunity .
So it &apos;s <unk> . We &apos;re going to paint this palette again .
He &apos;s going to touch . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to say , but it &apos;s going to trade .
We &apos;re going to embrace their ideas , or not .
( Music ) Did you see his bill .
And I created a music .
This time the texture changed the way .
It was a little more rhythmic , a little more intense for my answer .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is whether it &apos;s not conscious , if every kid &apos;s not aware of it , but it doesn &apos;t want to be aware of their peers to get the idea and will not allow the creativity .
This <unk> is really incredible .
It &apos;s an <unk> experience .
And I know I &apos;m talking about all of me when we don &apos;t get rid of it .
We know that to be able to rise to the <unk> and make music is a psychiatrist .
What do you do to do this with you ?
We are all musicians musicians , our <unk> is not the most useful for the manufacturing .
( Laughter ) And I just want to show you how they &apos;re faced .
And the other dynamics is that we don &apos;t get rid of jazz .
There are people who do it .
But that limit the odds .
If you go back to the band of the band that I &apos;m like this , and I want to go into it .
Well , we did something .
One , two , two , two , three , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s a little bit called me because I gave me the ideas .
<unk> : <unk> on this side . &quot; &quot; If I want to the music , the best I can do is listen .
It &apos;s the science science .
It has to see what I can figure out what I can do .
If I want the music to get a certain level of <unk> , the first step for me is to be patient , listen to what happens and collect something about me .
When you do it , <unk> and <unk> to the other musicians and they ate more , and they &apos;re going to do it .
Look , one , two , two , two , three , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s something completely distinct when I had my ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic .
It &apos;s not about getting my vision with nothing .
It is about to be at the moment , and we &apos;ll get to the other and let them give you the creativity .
Thank you .
( Applause )

He wrote this to his love .
I &apos;m going to be sincere , and then these amazing talks and ideas that are being exposed to , <unk> in the <unk> position here to tell you about the television .
Everybody sees the television .
<unk> . <unk> some things .
Here in America are <unk> .
The media sees the television is almost five hours a day .
Well ?
I &apos;m sure of the television , so that for me , is something <unk> .
But people don &apos;t like .
They did it .
<unk> it is useless , and things worse , <unk> .
My mother , when I was a girl , he said , &quot; &quot; The <unk> , &quot; &quot; and my intent today is not <unk> if there &apos;s a good television or the bad television ; my idea today is to tell me that I think the television has consciousness .
If I think the television looks like consciousness is because I think that television reflects directly out of the moral , social and emotional political and emotional policies in our nation â€” the television is how we &apos;ve evolved to solve our values of values .
All of that is valuable to humans and <unk> our idea of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk about good TV or bad .
We talk about popular television .
We talk about 10 programs in the audience for a 50 50 years .
As a <unk> , it reflects not just what you &apos;ve heard , which is the idea of our social social unconscious and collective social social and collective , if you don &apos;t necessarily , like those 10 programs per year ?
How is it going to take television throughout the time , and that tells us our society to our society ?
<unk> to the subject of evolution , from a basic biology , is that the animal kingdom , including humans , has four basic primary instincts .
<unk> , relationships , power and <unk> .
As humans , what you have to remember is that we &apos;re going to take the time to <unk> or <unk> these basic animals .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel fear , compassion .
This is not that in the animal kingdom .
The other thing about human beings is that we love the entertainment .
You &apos;ll see the television .
This is something that makes us clearly from the animal world .
As animals can play , they can play , but they don &apos;t even notice .
So I &apos;m going to figure out what it understands from this relationship of the human relationship between the TV shows and the human consciousness .
Why is the entertainment of it ?
The kid had <unk> like sketches &apos;s sketches and the <unk> sitting in our shoulder .
The television works like our consciousness , <unk> and <unk> at the same time ?
To help these questions , we &apos;ve done a research study .
She took 50 years to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We talk to 3,000 people almost <unk> â€” from 18 and 70 years , and it &apos;s going to be emotionally .
How do you ever notice each one of these programs ?
Will a moral <unk> ?
Do you know ? <unk> ?
What meant for you ?
In the TED audience , I mean , this <unk> <unk> in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of emotion are emotional .
And second year , a 80 percent of the most popular <unk> programs in the rest of the world .
I want our audience <unk> if you feel guilty .
I want to give you the two people before it happen to happen to the first slide : &quot; &quot; <unk> inspired me to think of the idea of consciousness and the <unk> that consciousness allows you to be judged on the day of consciousness , Jack <unk> .
And so in the way I &apos;m going to make the data , I want you to get away from a TED member of Hans Hans Rosling .
Well we go back .
So here you see in 1960 to 2010 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things that we &apos;re going to begin to start the state of <unk> and the state of moral <unk> , which , for this study , we define that when I &apos;m going to make me feel better with the world .
<unk> moral are the programs that don &apos;t catch the difference between good and bad .
At principle , you see that in 1960 <unk> <unk> .
So we see the television .
<unk> moral starts to mobilize .
I &apos;m listening to the end of the 60 , the moral <unk> increases , and being low .
Why ?
The crisis of the <unk> of Cuba , the <unk> and <unk> , the Civil Rights Movement , the <unk> and <unk> , the Vietnam War , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Look what happens .
In 1970 &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
<unk> moral <unk> .
<unk> , more Ronald Reagan , a television president , is the control .
He &apos;s going to raise his flight .
But look , you can &apos;t , like , the <unk> , the disaster , Chernobyl .
<unk> moral becomes the dominant tendency since 1990 to the next 20 years .
So let &apos;s look at this .
This graph shows a similar tendency .
But in this case , we have the happiness <unk> <unk> <unk> in blue and green .
And in the television , we have &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the national leader of the happiness .
It &apos;s going to increase . The happiness will kill .
<unk> starts to rise .
<unk> the social media increases .
We come to 1969 and look what happens .
The happiness , <unk> and the social media , not just fighting in our society , but there are two programs , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which in 1969 are number two and number three in the rates .
What was the number one ?
And the series socially socially , <unk> socially <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We all <unk> together .
The viewers agreed .
Let &apos;s see this green peak in <unk> with a series of trends .
When he <unk> the term , success without unprecedented , who mean ?
I mean , on the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; went away .
This was the first program that I would <unk> to say , &quot; &quot; My god , I can comment on what I think of the Vietnam War , about the president , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what you want to say an unprecedented unprecedented .
Well , at the same graph , look what happens .
1970 &apos;s <unk> <unk> . <unk> .
We don &apos;t see the television by entertainment .
The social media and the <unk> <unk> throughout the 70 .
Now look this .
How about the &apos; 70s ? Lear .
I have &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and the main program , and the key program in the world 10 across the 1970s ...
In the 50 years of television that we study , seven of the 10 programs have been touched during the Vietnam War , five of the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> .
Just a generation , in 20 years , and we learned , &quot; &quot; Hey ! can do that ?
Could you feel that ?
Could it be ?
The audience so I knew I want to tell you that the people of the digital people did not invented the problems .
Archie Bunker was pushed out of his <unk> <unk> together with the rest of us .
This is another graph . With other <unk> : <unk> and imagination , who are <unk> programs like , &quot; &quot; <unk> of reality &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> fine &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Make me feel better . &quot; &quot; What do you do in the red of the red .
And I &apos;m going to show you every time that the <unk> and imagination is <unk> .
We want to see programs about people saving money and stop ?
No . In the 1970s , we have the number a leader series &quot; &quot; The woman said , &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re going to go to the 10 in 1973 in 1973 , followed by &quot; &quot; The man of six million dollars &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The man of Charlie . &quot; &quot; Another peak in the 1980s ...
What would there have programs ?
<unk> and rich .
&quot; &quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
A <unk> show of our national psyche with made fast and tough .
Now , my favorite slide , because these are the last 20 years .
<unk> or not in my <unk> , sure that you &apos;ve heard or <unk> about the fall of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
As we say this <unk> , the X mark the place .
The 1990s , the 1970s , <unk> like &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
But look , the mark .
2001 , in September of 2001 , the <unk> <unk> .
Why not ?
We had the presidential presidential 2000 .
<unk> <unk> tech .
The September of September .
<unk> <unk> in part of the social lexicon .
<unk> what happens in time .

I can run out of the island .
I can do the daughter of Sarah Palin .
I can hold the new <unk> . You &apos;re <unk> .
Great , right ?
It turns out to radically different kinds of things that are these programs , of pure fighters , of course , in 50 years â€” that &apos;s what I said at the beginning ?
We are animals , we need our efforts .
There was not a television student without a <unk> and dominant mother .
In the decade of it : June <unk> in the <unk> program , &quot; &quot; Make it to <unk> . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to <unk> them through the <unk> of moral consciousness .
<unk> <unk> , the archetype of <unk> , who talked about abortion , <unk> , even the <unk> on the television .
In the 1980s , it came the first &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in the 1980s .
<unk> Brown Brown wrote a <unk> when he occurred to be a single mother .
The mother was , <unk> Van <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s about a demo or a <unk> sitting in our consciousness , sitting in our trajectories , what I know I love this picture .
So all of me , women and men from <unk> , the audience of <unk> , thanks to me that I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you some of my thought to consciousness .
But also let me go away to the <unk> that if you take the morning to <unk> their ideas in your screens over these years .
Dan his life on the television , safe , but you just like a spectators , through social social awareness , <unk> life , longevity or not .
So thank you very much .
( Applause )
In 1994 I got a prison prison in <unk> , and I met a son of 12 and 12 years that he was tortured , and he gave him the access to a lawyer .
And by the eyes of the eyes , I realized that the hundreds of letters of letters that had written the politicians in the policy-makers , they never had any letter to him , because it wasn &apos;t a seven-year-old boy who made something important for somebody .
It wasn &apos;t a politician .
It was a child for 12 years .
What was also given me that was not only in <unk> , but that &apos;s not only in <unk> , but that &apos;s the <unk> countries in the developing developing world that <unk> the right as a lawyer and the right to not be tortured .
And I realized I had an incredible <unk> of opportunities for all of us as a world community community community community , and we finally realized how research method of research .
The kid we think in the torture as a form of biological torture or which is necessary as only for the worst , but in fact , 95 percent of the <unk> today are not going to be for political .
I &apos;m for people who are interested in <unk> systems , and sadly , put that torture is the most cheaper form of research â€” it &apos;s cheaper than having a <unk> system , but it &apos;s cheaper than having a lawyer or access to life .
And the day today , you know , it &apos;s possible for us to be possible for us as the world community community , if we take that decision , <unk> and end as a research method for our life , but this <unk> of three things .
First of all , the <unk> , the power of power and connection worldwide scale .
The second is to make sure that there &apos;s a <unk> access and systematic to care .
And the third is commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I started <unk> , and if we did it ?
Could we do something for those 93 countries ?
And I founded the International Space Telescope to <unk> , which has a specific mission to end up with torture like method of research and focus on practice of <unk> <unk> in these 93 countries , <unk> <unk> in an early stage in <unk> and courts .
And yet my first experiences came out of <unk> and my first tour of my first visit to <unk> , when there was , in 1994 , still less than 10 days in the country , because the <unk> would kill us all .
And even 20 years later , so there was only 10 days later in the country , and so at the same time , the <unk> in a prison prison was not just a young woman , but he said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why are there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why are there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why are there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why are there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why are you going to take here from 10 years , because my husband has made
The first group of <unk> <unk> and I still remember , while I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do to investigate ? &quot;
And the room goes into silence and finally , a woman <unk> , &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I have <unk> more than one of the people and ever ever had to do any research , because they all came up with <unk> . &quot; &quot; And we talked , as a man , from the fact that the first one , the <unk> might
And these advocates , I had to <unk> out of value to decide that they &apos;re going to advocate for them to defend them in practice in practice of these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where the day , the 25 together , she and the rest behind me and the rest behind me , and they said , &quot; &quot; No , not , we &apos;re not going to do the stuff in the same way in the way , but one day came out the perfect case . &quot; &quot; But one day came out the perfect case . It was a woman who <unk> out of the house .
She said , &quot; &quot; You have seen the person going to go away from the person to go away and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get it up , but the police came up , but she didn &apos;t have nothing on it .
So then she was a <unk> . He had a hair . I had a abortion .
And when he took his case before a judge , for the first time this <unk> , he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence there except by the <unk> <unk> and so it &apos;s going to be wrong in freedom . &quot; &quot; And neuroscientists started taking cases a little and another time and as well as you &apos;ll see , a little bit , and as you &apos;ll see , little little twos starting to change the course of the story of <unk> .
But it &apos;s not .
She used to think , then it &apos;s just in <unk> ?
Or also happens in other countries ?
But it turns out in so many countries â€” ( Laughter ) But what happens in so many countries â€” ( Laughter ) But what happens in so many countries â€” ( Laughter ) But what happens in so many countries â€” ( Laughter ) But what happens in so many countries â€” ( Laughter ) But what happens in so many countries â€” ( Laughter ) But what happens in so many countries â€” ( Laughter ) But what happens in so many countries â€” ( Laughter ) But what happens in so many countries â€” ( Laughter
Anyway , I walked into a prison , and he was not a seven-year-old eight-year-old , but a child eight years ago I would get a mobile phone .
Or a woman , I stood in arms to his baby , a great baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is so beautiful ! &quot; &quot; But it wasn &apos;t a baby , the girl had three years ago .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here for her , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I had to <unk> two <unk> and a psychiatrist .
And when I went through the director of prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to <unk> .
A judge would take off your <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can <unk> , but look at my prison . The 80 percent of the two people here are going to do . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; And then the lawyers started to figure out a system where they could take the cases .
And we realized that it wasn &apos;t just the case of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers to get the difference .
For example , in <unk> , what happened was that &#91; name &#93; &#93; &quot; &quot; name , &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t dark , but he had 24 of the lawyers , and in the same way , in China , I always believe that , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a cool wind in the Thar Desert when we can <unk> . &quot; &quot; Or , in China , where I remember <unk> , after eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve heard that we can &apos;t help to create fairness because we don &apos;t need the resources . &quot; &quot; And then I said , &quot; &quot; But I want to tell you that the lack of resources never was to <unk> for the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; But I want to tell you that the lack of resources never was <unk> to the <unk> cases .
So everything we &apos;ve found was the solution that we &apos;ve found was the <unk> and then the access .
It hasn &apos;t been in <unk> and I decided to talk to another group of lawyers , and what I was told was they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , now we don &apos;t have a police cop in the streets . &quot; &quot; The police is one of the main reasons why we had the revolution .
What do you do , then ? &quot; &quot; <unk> with one of the development agencies , and they were forming and <unk> , who &apos;s been the normal tendency in the corner of <unk> .
It &apos;s also a manual exercise that was great .
And they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll be <unk> . &quot; &quot; The lawyers can come to the cop .
<unk> were mapped .
But they said , &quot; &quot; I just have a question , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I just have a question , &quot; &quot; what happened to them while ? &quot; &quot; And after a break , they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And so the key bits are not just the way of the lawyers , but find a way to get a way to deploy systematically the access to the access , because they &apos;re the guarantee in the system for people who are being tortured .
And while I &apos;m telling you this , they &apos;re also aware that it sounds like a &quot; &quot; Yes , of course , it sounds like if you could do , but let me do it in reality ? &quot; &quot; Because it seems something enormous .
And it &apos;s a lot of reason why I think it &apos;s possible .
The first of them is that the people on the woods find ways to create miracles from their commitment .
And it &apos;s not just <unk> , who I talked to you about <unk> , but also advocates all around the world that are looking for two key bits .
We have a program called <unk> , and we realized that there were people <unk> and who wanted to help them , but how do we do it ?
So it &apos;s just a competition in line where you can gain five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to tell you about five thousand dollars to play .
And there &apos;s 30 <unk> around the world , from Sri Lankan to <unk> or the Democratic Republic of the DRC , which with five thousand dollars do things , through texting , <unk> programs and whatever .
And there &apos;s not just these <unk> , but there are also people who are <unk> who are their contacts , and how they can move them together .
For example , in China &apos;s <unk> laws that would argue that the cops could kill people who had punished .
And while I was sitting together with one of our <unk> of our lawyers , I said , &quot; &quot; How do we do it ? How do we get it in practice ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You have money ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay , still . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I talked to the fact that we need to form and supporting care .
We need to move forward to access to the access to care .
But the third and final point , the most important , is that we have to do this .
And people say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is very good , but it &apos;s too <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the reason why I think this point is interesting is because that &apos;s exactly the same view that if you look at the people who were prepared for slavery or apartheid .
It started with a small group of people who were <unk> .
One of our favorite poems of the achievements , they share with themselves , is , &quot; &quot; We need value , friends , friends , the way it &apos;s never clear , and there &apos;s a lot of game , but in the bottom , you &apos;re not sure , &quot; &quot; and there &apos;s a lot of game , but at the bottom , you &apos;re not <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m safe , you &apos;re not <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m safe , you &apos;re not <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I
And I always wondered , because I know that the question is going to be , and it &apos;s going to be a pleasure to talk to you somewhere else , but I can do it right ? &quot; &quot; Well , according to the first place you know what you can do . ( Laughter ) And secondly , I would argue with the story of <unk> , which of fact was my aunt to set up the International Space Telescope .
It was a child for four years when I met it . <unk> in a <unk> prison in <unk> <unk> , but as a <unk> in prison , they all had a lot of gratitude , even the <unk> , which was the only one who could go to and get away from the <unk> .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s a <unk> , and when it <unk> started to grow , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to grow ?
What he was was going to happen by the first <unk> , and the second and the second , and then the second one , and then the second one , and after the third , and after the third , and after the third , and after the first one . And he had his finger <unk> , because what he wanted to do was to go to visit .
And of course , I never drank to visit the whole world every day every day , but she wanted to visit everyone &apos;s shells . And by the <unk> , he turned his fingers through .
Or if the cells were dark , it was like iron and turning his fingers through .
And the most part of the <unk> <unk> that was their greatest compassionate and the sun and that we &apos;ve always acted . And I thought , here &apos;s a <unk> . A child &apos;s eight-year-old .
Born in prison without almost nothing , no goods , but a sense of his own journey , but a sense of his own journey at me , and told me , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve certainly couldn &apos;t do it all .
But it &apos;s a person . I can do something .
And I &apos;ll do the only thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so I will tell you about to have the imagination of a new world with all of us together and I invite you to do this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Some people think there &apos;s a formula for the TED Talk : &quot; Take a talk in a <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Storytelling a story of childhood . &quot;
<unk> a love secret .
<unk> with a <unk> called the action .
No .
It &apos;s not like you have to think of a TED .
In fact , if you take too much of these mechanisms , you get a <unk> or an emotional emotional .
But there &apos;s a thing that all TED Talks have to share in common , and I &apos;d like to share these with you , because I &apos;d like to share with you , because I want to talk to you , if you don &apos;t want to hear a lot of TED , listening to TED , you like this .
I &apos;m going to talk to the talks of the audience of the audience , and I learned directly from them from a great talk .
And yet these <unk> and their subjects seem completely different , they all have a common ingredient .
And this is this : The main task like <unk> is to transfer the mind of who you hear a remarkable gift , a stranger and beautiful object we call an idea .
Let me <unk> .
This is <unk> .
It &apos;s about giving a TED Talk , and frankly , it &apos;s <unk> .
( Video ) <unk> : <unk> Van <unk> !
( Applause ) One 200 people , one 200 people , a lot of what we &apos;ve never seen before you feel that your brains are going to get away with your brain &apos;s brain .
They literally started to <unk> the same brain patterns .
And not just mean they &apos;re suffering the same emotions .
We &apos;re going to take a look at the brain for a moment .
There are millions of neurons in a <unk> .
But look here , just here : a few billion are connected to each way that represents a simple idea .
In the mind of the whole audience .
It &apos;s like , just in a couple of minutes , a pattern that involves millions of neurons in the one 200 heads , just with the people listening to a voice and look a face .
But <unk> , which is an idea ?
Well , you can apply it as a pattern of information that helps us understand and navigate the world .
The ideas came from a lot of forms and <unk> , since the complex and <unk> and <unk> .
Here &apos;s a couple of examples <unk> from the TED stage .
Sir Ken Robinson is the key of the future of our children .
( Video ) Sir Ken Robinson : Which <unk> is that creativity now is that creativity now , and we should have <unk> with the same status quo .
Chris Anderson : <unk> Hardy <unk> with <unk> is beautiful .
( Video ) <unk> games : <unk> around us , is strong , is elegant , resists <unk> .
CA : Well , I would argue that people are more than a simple identity .
Video : <unk> argued : The simple story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that it &apos;s false .
CA : Well , your mind <unk> ideas , and it doesn &apos;t .
They are connected with us .
<unk> , make an incredible structure that &apos;s a complex structure that &apos;s your personal personal view .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain .
It &apos;s like <unk> around the world .
And over millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a small component of your view of your view of the world is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then by the green of this .
But if another component of your view of your view of the world is the idea that slingers are dangerous , then the green is dangerous , kind of different .
So it &apos;s quite obvious that the ideas that make your vision of the world are crucial .
It turns out that it &apos;s the most insidious thing that &apos;s possible , a driver for the <unk> but wonderful world .
Now , the different places in the world &apos;s world can be very different .
For example , how is your view of your view of the world when you see this picture : ( Video ) Dalia Mogahed : What you think you see ?
&quot; &quot; One woman of faith , &quot; &quot; a cake , even &quot; &quot; a cake , &quot; &quot; a few , even after a woman ?
Or &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; the washing &quot; &quot; a terrorist . &quot;
CA : Whatever the answer is the answer , there are millions of people out there in that way .
If you look down in the right way , they &apos;re able to change , in the way , the way somebody sees the world and transform their actions so much like the future .
The ideas are the most powerful force that drives the human culture .
So if you realize that your main task like <unk> is to build an idea in your mind in your audience &apos;s mind , here &apos;s four <unk> to address that task : First , <unk> your talk to a single idea .
The ideas are complex things ; you need to reduce the content to be able to get rid of it in a simple idea that I &apos;m more like you , and having the chance of it .
You have to get a context , share examples , doing real .
So I &apos;m going to give you an idea , and I &apos;ll tell you that it &apos;s a thread that will take all of your talk , so it &apos;s all the way that they &apos;re <unk> .
Second , I would ask you to listen to a reason for you .
Before we begin to build things in the minds of the audience in the audience , you have to have their permission to come .
What is the tool to happen ?
curiosity .
<unk> curiosity of the audience .
<unk> questions , <unk> questions , <unk> to identify why no sense of meaning .
If you can reveal a <unk> in your view of somebody else &apos;s view , we &apos;ll be able to cover that gap of knowledge .
And when I <unk> that desire is much more easy to start building the idea .
Third , <unk> your idea , piece of piece of a piece of concepts that your audiences know .
We have the power of language to weave together concepts that have already in the mind of who you hear , but not in your language , in your language .
You know where they are .
The kid told me that many of us have a lot of things and concepts that are totally unusual for their audiences .
Well , wherever you play a crucial role to show you how they fit the bits , because it turns out the shape of the pattern of the pattern , based on an idea that they listen to it .
For example , when Jennifer <unk> had to explain the incredible new biotech company called the CRISPR , he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , for the first time , a text of text .
<unk> lets it cut and take into genetic information so easily . &quot; &quot; Well , an graph , like this one had a great moment of <unk> while in our mind .
It &apos;s important , for so much , to try to talk with friends of trust , and to see that parts more <unk> .
<unk> . Here &apos;s the end of the end , it &apos;s made your ideas to be <unk> .
So this is what I mean to do this question : What does this idea ?
And you need to be honest with the answer .
If the idea just to tell you about you and your organization , then I feel you probably not allowed to be shared .
The audience will see through you .
But if you realize that the idea has the potential for the potential , someone or to change the view of someone &apos;s perspective to better or to inspire somebody else else else , then you have the essential ingredient to a good talk , one that can be a gift for them and for all of us .
It &apos;s only one 25 percent of what we hear .
( Laughter ) So let me tell you all the time every single day , I would argue that every single day I had ever imagined that I was doing it every day .
( <unk> ) With this <unk> , it &apos;s going to be hard to listen .
And the art of the conversation of conversation is the art of the conversation , and the art of the conversation of the conversation , and the art of the conversation of the conversation , and the art of the conversation of the conversation , and the art of the conversation of the conversation , and the art of the conversation of the conversation , and the art of the conversation of the conversation , and the art of the conversation of the conversation , and the art of the conversation of the conversation , and the art of
A world where we &apos;re not listening to each other .
( Laughter ) To <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> the ear , to <unk> and recalibrate the ear ear to <unk> and recalibrate the ear .
It &apos;s about to appreciate the ordinary sounds .
For example , this is my <unk> .
We see the ordinary sounds can be very interesting if we get attention .
The sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
Imagine that you &apos;re on a street of any place in America and it &apos;s a <unk> and <unk> : &quot; Sorry , what &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; <unk> ... , this is the Wall Street Wall Street , is that it &apos;s <unk> Street .
This is the <unk> street , that 27 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Okay . What &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; Well , the words don &apos;t have names .
The streets have names , apples only are <unk> without name between the streets . &quot; &quot; The <unk> march , a little bit <unk> and <unk> .
Now , imagine you &apos;re on a street board in Japan , <unk> to the person you have on the side and ask questions like this street ?
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the apple apple and that authorities . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the streets don &apos;t have names .
apples .
Look Google Maps here . There &apos;s the British 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 .
All of these apples have names , and the streets are only about the name between apples .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you know your house ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is <unk> 8 .
<unk> , home number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; But I walk through the <unk> I watched the numbers of the houses are not in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course , yeah . They Van in the order of what we were .
The first house was an apple is the number one .
The second house that &apos;s built is the number two .
The third one is the number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s just obvious . &quot; &quot; I love how sometimes we have to go on the other side of the world to tell us about things that we would have to go on the other side of the world to tell us that the opposite of them might be true .
As for example , there are doctors in China who believe that their work is healthy .
So every month that you &apos;re healthy , you have to be able to <unk> , and when you don &apos;t care about it because you don &apos;t care about it because you think it would be in their work .
( Applause ) We called the music , &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is the strong time , the beginning of the music . One , two , three , four .
But in the music of Africa , the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is the end of the sentence , like the end of a sentence .
So it turns out to listen not just in the <unk> but in the way that I &apos;m saying , two , three , four , one .
And this map also is true and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a man who says that for any real thing to say about India , the gene will also be true .
So I didn &apos;t tell me , so much in TED as a somewhere else , that for any brilliant idea that we have , or <unk> , the other also can be true .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
