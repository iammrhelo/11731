( Arabic ) <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
( <unk> ) <unk> in a middle class .
My father was five years old when she lost his father , but when I was <unk> , he was already a business man .
If your children were children or girls , if their children were children or girls , they went to school .
So I suppose I was <unk> .
My mother was 16 times .
In <unk> 16 , we &apos;re alive five .
You can imagine why I had to pass when I was a girl .
<unk> , she watched women being transported to <unk> , or children being found a <unk> .
At that point , when I finished a high school , I wanted to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I <unk> my education , but I &apos;ll get to university .
<unk> , in my country , there didn &apos;t have been <unk> to women in the <unk> , but even if I was in school school , I couldn &apos;t go .
As a result , my father <unk> America .
I watched in America .
A couple of my studies came up .
Whereas <unk> my education , Russia has <unk> my country .
You know , when I was the end of my <unk> , I was asked what was happening to my family and my country .
<unk> months , and I had no news .
My family became a <unk> field .
So instead I ended up the research , <unk> my family .
I wanted to keep them safe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when you get the news , when you get the news , when it &apos;s still what you take in my country , would you make your heart .
I would take back back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t go , because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
It was <unk> in a university .
<unk> .
She had a good life .
My family was here .
They try to live with them .
So it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to <unk> my home .
So we put it into the field of <unk> .
And when I came to the field of <unk> <unk> , there was seven million and a half million <unk> . Seven million and a half of the <unk> .
<unk> , black , black women were women and children . Most men in the war or they were in their war , and they know ?
When he was the apple reports , when he was the apple apple , he <unk> with things that don &apos;t <unk> .
I watched a widow with five and eight kids , sitting there , won &apos;t know what to do .
I watched a new woman who didn &apos;t have to go in , without studies , or income , or a place where to live .
You watched kids who have lost their parents , their <unk> and that with 10 or <unk> , they had to take their families , to be the head of the family and trying to protect their siblings and their children .
The situation was absolutely <unk> .
My heart is <unk> by my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
In that moment , it feels a impulse .
At that point , I felt , what I can do for these people ?
How can I <unk> ?
I &apos;m just one person , who can do for them ?
But at that point , I knew that education has <unk> my life .
<unk> . It will take a position .
<unk> trust . It &apos;s a career .
I used to take him into my family , holding my family to another country , so they were safe .
And at the moment I knew that what he meant to provide my people was education and health and that was what we &apos;re going to get .
But they think it &apos;s easy ?
Yeah , because of that , women didn &apos;t have access to education .
Furthermore , after <unk> of Russia in Afghanistan , people had no longer yet .
It was very difficult to get and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot;
Somebody came from the United States .
Anyone who has been here .
<unk> in me ? It &apos;s supposed to not .
So what really needed was to win the confidence of this community .
How do I go to it ?
I went to <unk> , I watched and watched .
I &apos;ve done questions .
So finally , I found a man .
He had 80 years .
It was a <unk> .
I went to his tent in the <unk> and <unk> , &quot; &quot; I want to give you a teacher . &quot;
And he <unk> it , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , crazy , how do I think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; Finally , <unk> my <unk> , and I started with a class in his <unk> , <unk> the voice .
In fact , a year ago , we had 25 schools worldwide , 15,000 kids going to school , and it was incredible .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
And of course , we were going to do our work , forming teachers . They live in rights of women , human rights , democracy , democracy , democracy and laws .
One day , I was in office in <unk> , a day , I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , and I was in office in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I was
And suddenly , I found that all of my personal team at the rooms , and suddenly I found that all my personal family went , and then we went , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot;
You &apos;re afraid . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know what your life is going to play .
But as a leader , you have to keep <unk> .
You have to keep <unk> and to show that .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people <unk> it in mass of my office .
So <unk> entering the offices .
He was nine , nine , nine .
These were the toughest men who can see never .
( Laughter ) People like a <unk> <unk> , black black , <unk> <unk> , and it grows mass in my office .
And I would like to sit and take a cup .
<unk> . Don &apos;t get tea .
And of course , the pitch voice was going to be a lot of fear , and I was really depressed .
But at the same time , <unk> <unk> .
And , of course , at the moment , you see as a moment ago , covered in my head by a black armband , and , of course , at the time , covered in my head .
The only thing I saw was the eyes .
<unk> : What do you do ?
You don &apos;t know how to <unk> <unk> <unk> women ?
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we looked at the face and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s my girls . &quot;
You have some students , some students , and all the Koran , the holy book .
You know ? The Koran says that if he <unk> the holy book , women can be good wives and they can obey their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And at that moment , they were talking about it . ( Laughter ) At that moment , they were talking about it .
<unk> between them and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , it &apos;s okay . &quot;
So my personal personal <unk> of my office .
They were killed <unk> .
They didn &apos;t know why not <unk> .
They didn &apos;t know why I don &apos;t care about them .
So , all of all sorts of worm .
So happy and of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) So of course , I &apos;ll be alive .
But also , as we follow it during the fall of the <unk> , when the <unk> had the power was another story .
<unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> girls , <unk> students would kill him .
With the <unk> <unk> , we went to the country and we open a school after another .
Open education centers for women .
Open clinics without stop .
We worked with women and children .
<unk> about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> how many types you can imagine .
I was very happy . She was <unk> with the result of my work .
And one day , when I was going on with four educators and a seat , I walked back to the north of Kabul , suddenly one time , <unk> at the middle of the road .
With it back to the back , we pasted the road .
<unk> my driver who was going on and <unk> , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing to see you . &quot; &quot; My name was the name of it , and he said , &quot; &quot; I can <unk> it . &quot;
What you want ? &quot; &quot; They said nothing and <unk> .
At that point , women will take it into the car .
I &apos;m happy and <unk> , &quot; &quot; This is the end .
This time , they would kill everyone .
I had no doubt .
But yet , when the moment comes out , it &apos;s going to make it the rest of what you think and what you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
<unk> in your <unk> and you can follow so much .
So I put it into a car side .
My leg <unk> and went out of the car .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; Where can I <unk> ? &quot; &quot; They know what they told me ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it goes .
Come every day from one place to another .
<unk> women , <unk> and also gives it the chance to have a job .
<unk> . What about you ?
What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; <unk> and <unk> : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Okay .
What we know , the only one we can do , by the time we &apos;ve played it , it &apos;s <unk> a weapon and kill .
We don &apos;t know more . &quot; &quot; And you know what it means .
Obviously , it was a compliment .
So I <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to let them go . &quot; &quot; And I came up and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going back , and I said to the driver , and I said to the driver , &quot; &quot; and then only <unk> women .
We only had money to help them to get them to the school , and nothing more .
When I arrived at the office , obviously all the educators <unk> .
He gave her home home . Nobody was .
My mouth was the only one who was there , and I would have no voice .
I was <unk> , sitting in my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What I &apos;m going to do ? &quot; &quot; So how I &apos;m going to solve this problem ?
Because it &apos;s called education in the north .
Hundreds of women said to <unk> .
So I was there sitting there , and suddenly , we &apos;re here talking about pulses , because at the time at the moment , one of my wonderful <unk> <unk> would have a report .
( <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And I wrote it .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot;
It was like <unk> , I didn &apos;t think I thought , and it was still asking me .
Okay , tell you it &apos;s going on .
<unk> all the story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for the next one , you go to them .
<unk> . &quot; &quot; And when two days later , I tried the same way , know what ?
So I stopped the car .
<unk> and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , <unk> me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
So I came up to the mosque and to summarize , said , I was going to <unk> teachers .
Now , they &apos;re the best educators .
<unk> English , learning how to be , learning computer and are my <unk> .
All the areas we don &apos;t know , in the mountain zones , they come to me . They go forward and go .
<unk> .
And ... ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That quiz changes people .
When we <unk> people , they change and , in today , we need to work with equality .
You can &apos;t raise women and <unk> men from men , because men are the people who are going to get them more difficult to women .
( Laughter ) So we started <unk> , because they must be aware of the potential of women , to know how the potential of that potential have the men and that women can <unk> the same jobs they have .
So we form men across and I think profoundly deeply deeply , and so we form a lot of men .
I live in a country that I live in a country that was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was beautiful , beautiful , beautiful country .
<unk> all parts .
Women gave us education : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — and we end up at a home .
Don &apos;t get the doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out of any security problems .
But we still want to keep Afghanistan before .
And I want to tell you the other part .
Now women &apos;s women work very , very hard .
<unk> . <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> to be <unk> , again .
<unk> to be <unk> and make business business .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people use all their potential and all this will happen .
I want to share with you for love for love , compassion , by trust and honesty .
If you have these things , you &apos;ll be successful .
We have a poet , <unk> <unk> .
He said , if you have compassion , and if you have love , you can take a world .
And we <unk> , we could .
And if we were able to Afghanistan , I &apos;m safe to 100 percent that anybody can do it in the world .
Thank you , very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Ten years ago I got a phone call that changed my life .
So I was <unk> at UCLA University at UCLA University in California , Los Angeles , <unk> <unk> .
I called this called a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
One old <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can see if you could go to the zoo and you can see it as a heart , to look for a possible heart .
We &apos;re going to leave clear that the United States has to be engaged with <unk> <unk> and highly <unk> that take a wonderful way of their own animals .
But sometimes , we would take it to the medical community , especially to some trade pair , but sometimes it &apos;s going to change the health .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the case of this <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of this <unk> , <unk> <unk> of this <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a collaborative process of <unk> and doctors , in a collaborative process of <unk> and doctors , in a collaborative process of <unk> and doctors on his heart .
And this process , that &apos;s called <unk> in many of humans , it was <unk> , with the exception of that <unk> and that glue .
<unk> symptoms , diagnostics , diagnostics and treatment for my own human patients ; they &apos;re going to have a lot of symptoms on their own animals .
And when I was in the same day at the same day at UCLA Medical Center at UCLA Medical Center .
And I started to see clearly one thing .
And basically , the doctors and the <unk> would kill the same diseases in their human patients and animals like a <unk> heart disease , a <unk> heart disease , even a psychiatric disorder , even a psychiatric disorder , even as psychiatric disorders , even as psychiatric and anxiety .
Well , I have to give you a <unk> .
Furthermore , I &apos;ve studied long-term physiology and evolutionary biology during university — even since I did my sophomore thesis on the <unk> of Darwin — to learn more about the significant features between the other animals and human is a touch of attention to me .
And I started to realize how he could be , with all of these <unk> , who would never have <unk> opinion to a <unk> or <unk> <unk> to have another point on one of my human patients ?
Did you hear a <unk> conference ?
And even more , why should we go ?
We &apos;ve all collected some biological connections between the animals and human beings .
We all know the medicines we prescribe , that we take or we give our families in a animal .
But there &apos;s a big difference between giving an animal a drug or a human disease , and that animal has to take a human illness and that animal develop diabetes or cancer disease .
If maybe , part of the surprise comes from the dynamics that our world makes between the urban and not urban .
You &apos;re going to talk about these kids that you think that la growing in the trees or the cheese comes from a plant .
The human hospitals today , there &apos;s a lot of other things that we &apos;re going to transform more and closer to the technology .
And this creates a <unk> gap between human patients that are there being treated and the animals that live in the oceans , in the <unk> and in jungles .
But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : &quot; But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : &quot; But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason .
And the doctors and scientists were able to take care of our species , Homo sapiens , it &apos;s just one one more , and more likely not one species more , and not particularly special than any other .
But in our underwear we don &apos;t end up .
It would take me the same time when you hear the Mozart or I see in my <unk> <unk> photos .
I think that we called the <unk> of human <unk> , even <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a higher species .
Well , but this <unk> is <unk> .
Now , when I see a human patient , I always ask myself , who know the doctors of animals on this problem I don &apos;t know ?
How could we take better to the human patient if we want to take better to the human patient if it &apos;s a human human patient ?
And here &apos;s some examples of the <unk> connections that led me this kind of <unk> .
It was heart heart disease .
In the year 2000 , the human <unk> , the <unk> of humans , the human <unk> of the year .
It was described in a parent that was the game that I lost the whole savings of the entire life on an departure from the altar of the altar .
But it turns out that this brand new diagnosis and it was a new and new human illness .
<unk> had had become <unk> , trying and even <unk> symptoms <unk> in animals , from the monkeys , to <unk> , from the 1950s .
How many human lives could have <unk> if this <unk> <unk> went to the door of the emergency doctor and <unk> ?
<unk> .
Some other human patients will kill themselves .
<unk> it is <unk> .
Some other animals also recognize themselves .
There are <unk> that <unk> <unk> and again to <unk> .
But the <unk> have very specific forms and <unk> , and even prevent the <unk> in the animals that get rid of it .
Wouldn &apos;t it be like this <unk> knowledge of <unk> , the parents and the patients who are struggling with them ?
<unk> <unk> and psychosis <unk> .
Sometimes by giving birth some female women in depression , sometimes in high depression , and still in <unk> states .
They can decline in their own child , and in the extreme cases coming to the <unk> .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> know they know that when instead of a <unk> , a little bit after the age , it could decline its <unk> , and they gave them the <unk> , and in some cases , <unk> to <unk> .
But <unk> <unk> is a treatment to address this <unk> syndrome that we can increase the oxytocin of <unk> .
Oxytocin is the hormone of <unk> , and it &apos;s that the <unk> has a gift in its <unk> .
Wouldn &apos;t it be that information from the <unk> and <unk> , of the family doctors and the patients who are faced with the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> ?
Despite the <unk> that &apos;s all this , the distance between our cultured is being large .
To <unk> , a lot of fear I &apos;m going to have to put in some of it .
There are doctors who can be <unk> without professionals who are not <unk> in medicine .
I mean , the Connecticut , <unk> and psychologists , but especially the <unk> .
Of course , most of the doctors don &apos;t have the idea that it &apos;s more difficult to enter today in a <unk> <unk> than one of the medicine of a medicine , and that when you go to medicine learn everything that &apos;s relevant to know about a species , Homo sapiens , <unk> , fish , fish and birds .
So I don &apos;t blame to <unk> myself with <unk> <unk> and ignorance of my coworkers .
So here &apos;s a punchline of part of the <unk> : How do you call a <unk> that you just know about treating a species ?
Time <unk> this distance became in my passion , and I &apos;m doing through programs like Darwin <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of our educational and residents .
And through the scenes , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of medicine and <unk> to get collaborative debates about the disease and the disorders of human patients .
At Princeton <unk> subjects as the treatment of a cancer disease , can we help treating cancer as a master of infant education , and how we understand the <unk> <unk> of a master cow , and how we understand the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cow , and how to understand the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , and how to understand the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , and how to understand the quality of the driver &apos;s anxiety .
In the scenes of <unk> , first in America , and now around the world , doctors and <unk> will drop their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> as colleagues as the doctors .
So the end of all , humans are also animals , and it &apos;s also time that we are , and it &apos;s time that we are , and we have doctors , and we found that we are , and we found that we have doctors , and we &apos;re going to get it into a <unk> health care system .
Because it turns out that some of the best and more <unk> drugs are being found by doctors that have patients who are not human .
And one of the best ways to treat the human patient is going to make a lot of attention to how everybody else &apos;s other patient &apos;s patient live , grow , <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) Here the key word is &quot; &quot; was . &quot;
( Applause ) Having <unk> brain was , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , that you can imagine , as you can imagine .
I didn &apos;t know anything about <unk> .
In cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , and in cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , you have <unk> , and in cultures , when you have <unk> , and in cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , you have <unk> , and in cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , you have <unk> , and in cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , you
Life , the one of a complex human being , is replaced by medical data : your <unk> , the medical exams , the list of medicine ...
Suddenly it would take a disease with legs .
The doctors start talking about a language that you don &apos;t .
I &apos;ll ask you to make your body with your body and your body <unk> .
People starts to change also because it begins to treat disease instead of the person .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What do you hear the doctor ? &quot; &quot; even before you say &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; As soon as I say &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; And as I said , &quot; &quot; Hello .
( Video ) <unk> of the guy , &quot; &quot; Am I to work with <unk> ?
Will I study ? Where do love love ? Are you creative ?
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What did I do to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; I can change something in my life style ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : There &apos;s something that can do to do it ?
There &apos;s some other option ? &quot; &quot; And of course , the doctors are the good guys in all these cases , because they &apos;re very unlikely and compromised with <unk> .
But it &apos;s also used to treat treating patients , so I would say that the time you &apos;re trying to get the point of view is a torture and you <unk> , literally , in a patient .
( Laughter ) Things are changing , but the typical part is that you &apos;re going to get rid of any way in knowing your situation , in knowing your family and friends or <unk> any way to modify your lifestyle , to minimize the risks of what you &apos;re going to do .
But with all , there &apos;s a lot to expect in the hands of a bunch of very professionals .
As I was in the hospital , I asked them to tell me my <unk> on my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I asked myself to <unk> my <unk> on my <unk> <unk> .
It was very difficult to do that , because it &apos;s not very common to ask a picture of your own <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked to him and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , <unk> , you don &apos;t care .
I think this .
The cure is , what &apos;s going to have to have to deal with all of my being . &quot; &quot; So the next day I would have to have to deal with the I was .
I was decided to change my relationship with <unk> and I was able to learn more about it before to do something as a surgery .
I &apos;m an artist , use several types of <unk> and open information on my job .
So my great bet was turned out to spread all the information , forming the information , and that &apos;s how any of it could be .
So I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot;
In fact I had to <unk> , but that topic we can talk about another talk .
( Laughter ) <unk> this word , &quot; &quot; La <unk> , &quot; &quot; because the Italian means &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; can have a lot of meanings .
In our Western culture , we mean to eradicate or going back to the disease , but in other cultures like an example of evolution , of the Mediterranean countries , or Africa , can represent many other things .
Of course I &apos;ve been interested to know of the opinion of doctors and the rest of the health of health , but also interested in the <unk> proposal for the performer by the poet , by the poet , or , for the <unk> .
<unk> social <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> all sorts of <unk> .
And it worked .
The place &quot; &quot; La <unk> &quot; &quot; has around the world .
It takes a lot of attention to Italy and the <unk> and more of 500 people in a very little time through emails through emails , social media — most of the reasons they were able to cure my <unk> , but many more the ones were <unk> to me as a person .
For example , <unk> thousands of videos , images , photos and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s the example of <unk> <unk> and his <unk> .
Or what he did is the performer Patrick <unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> sculpture of my tumor and <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Now you can also have my <unk> !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s something great , we can share the same <unk> .
And this was what was happening : scientists , experts in traditional medicine , diverse researchers — they &apos;re all connected to me .
Given all of this information and support , I &apos;ve been able to collect a team of functional neurosurgeons , traditional doctors , <unk> and several hundreds of <unk> with the time I could talk about the information that was going to take care , which is very important .
<unk> , we can formulate a strategy of my own own <unk> in different languages and as different cultures .
So , the current strategy is <unk> the entire world and thousands of years of human history , things that I find a lot of original things .

So I could take my time to go .
<unk> the doctor who wanted to work , I would make the hospital in which I wanted to be , and it &apos;s all the time that thousands of people taught me without feeling worthwhile .
All the world felt that could be <unk> <unk> , and this was the most important part of La <unk> .
What were the results ?
I &apos;m okay , as you can see , very well .
( Applause ) The great news news after surgery : I have — ( Applause ) I have — ( Applause ) I , I , I had — a <unk> <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> .
It was absolutely my life and my lifestyle style .
It was very intense , but it was very intense , but it was very intense , I had a framework of electrodes connected to my brain right now , to build a functional map of what the brain controls .
And just before the operation , we were able to look at this map with the doctor to understand the risks I was going to run , and if there was something that I &apos;d like to avoid .
Obviously , <unk> .
This <unk> was the true key of La <unk> .
<unk> people shared their stories , their experiences .
The doctors came to talk to people who don &apos;t have to <unk> when it &apos;s about <unk> .
<unk> me really , I &apos;m in a state focusing on translation of a lot of different languages , where the science is written with emotion and graphs of conventional graphs .
&#91; <unk> &#93; The key to <unk> <unk> was a part of a truly committed society and connected , global well-being depends on from each other of their individuals .
This <unk> world is my <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Applause )
I don &apos;t have the idea of what we &apos;re going to play .
I can &apos;t tell you what it is until it <unk> .
I didn &apos;t think I was going to be there .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with that to listen .
( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) Well , before nothing , I <unk> <unk> the <unk> Williams in the station , ( Applause ) and Christian <unk> on the piano . ( Applause )
<unk> , as we call it , is a incredible space .
It &apos;s a sacred place .
And one of the things that they make sacred is that we don &apos;t tell us the chance to think about the future , or in the past .
They &apos;re really alive in this moment .
There are so many decisions when one goes to <unk> .
We didn &apos;t even know what we &apos;re going to touch .
So we had a <unk> interpretation of a song called &quot; &quot; <unk> Boom . &quot; &quot; But that could happen or not .
We &apos;re all listening . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for the ideas .
So the idea of a error : from a jazz player , is more easy to talk about the error of another person else .
And the way I would get a mistake when I &apos;m in the <unk> — before nothing , we don &apos;t see as a mistake .
The only mistake that you &apos;re not supposed to be able to realize that it &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
Each mistake is an opportunity to jazz .
Even it &apos;s difficult to describe what would be a fun .
For example , if you look like a color , as if you &apos;re playing with the palette , it requires sonar like this ...
( Music ) If Christian touches a bill ... like <unk> . ( Music )
You see , everything fits in your circle of colors .
If it comes to E .
You see , all of the interior of this emotional palette that we are painting .
And yet , if you touch <unk> .
You &apos;re going to see , let &apos;s play a moment .
And we &apos;re going to play this palette .
( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music )
And we won &apos;t look at it .
I &apos;m going to play it for a second , and then we &apos;ll try to stop and talk to a moment .
Let &apos;s see that &apos;s what happens when we touch with this palette .
( Music ) <unk> , somebody could play like a mistake .
I just would say that it &apos;s a mistake if it &apos;s a mistake if you don &apos;t .
A lost chance .
So it &apos;s <unk> . Let &apos;s paint it again .
He &apos;s going to play . I don &apos;t know how you &apos;re going to look like , but it &apos;s going to look like it .
We &apos;re going to embrace their ideas , or not .
( Music ) Did you see the bill .
And I created a <unk> .
This time the texture changed .
It was a little bit more rhythmic , a bit more intense for my response .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is if you &apos;re not conscious , if every pill is not conscious , and don &apos;t understand their fellow partners to incorporate the idea and we &apos;re not going to make creativity .
This <unk> is truly incredible .
It &apos;s a <unk> experience .
And I know I &apos;m talking about all when I say we don &apos;t vote .
We know that to be able to rise to the <unk> and make music is a blessing .
And what do you have to see this with finance ?
We are all jazz musicians , our <unk> , it &apos;s not the most dangerous to finance .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m just going to show you how we &apos;re faced .
And the other dynamic is that we don &apos;t have <unk> on jazz .
There are people who do it .
But that &apos;s easy selection .
If you &apos;re going to go back to the band you look like this , and I want you to get it like this , and I &apos;ll say to you in ...
Let me show you something .
One , two , two , three , four , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s a little <unk> because I &apos;m going to give me the ideas .
<unk> : <unk> on this side . &quot; &quot; If I want to <unk> music , the best I can do is listen to .
It &apos;s the science science .
It has more to see how I can perceive it to what I can do .
If I want to <unk> music to a certain level of <unk> , the first step to me is to be patient , listening to what happens and collect something of what happens around me .
When you do it , you &apos;re going to <unk> and <unk> to the other musicians , and then it &apos;s going to do it .
Look , two , two , two , three , four , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s something completely different about my ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It has many more <unk> .
It &apos;s not about getting my vision .
It is about to be at the moment , and we &apos;re going to take each other and let them make that make the creativity .
Thank you .

All the world sees television .
<unk> . I &apos;ll show you some ways .
Here in America &apos;s people .
The media sees the television sees about five hours a day .
Well ?
<unk> I live from television , so to me , is something <unk> .
But the lot of people don &apos;t like .
They &apos;ve done it .
<unk> it is useless , and things worse , <unk> .
My mother , when I was a girl , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> box . &quot; &quot; My intent today is not <unk> if there &apos;s a good television or a bad television ; my idea today is to tell you I think English is .
If I think the television has consciousness is because I think the television reflects directly the moral needs , social and emotional , <unk> in our nation — the television is like <unk> today .
All of it is intrinsic to humans and <unk> to our idea of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk about good television or bad .
We talk about <unk> television .
We talk about 10 programs with the audience for a 50 years .
So like that .
How can you take television over time , and what will you tell me about our society ?
<unk> to the topic of evolution , from a basic biology , is that the animal kingdom that the animal kingdom , including humans , has four basic instincts .
<unk> , relationships , power , and the desire of <unk> .
As humans , what we &apos;ve figured out is that we have to remember it , we &apos;re going to take it up with time to <unk> , or we would kill these basic animals .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel fear , compassion .
This is not in the animal kingdom .
The other thing about humans is that we love the entertainment .
You &apos;ll see the television .
This is something that makes us clear from the animal world .
As animals can play , but they didn &apos;t look at it .
So I want to discover what you understand from this exclusive relationship between humans between the television shows and human consciousness .
Why evolved this way ?
The kid <unk> like cartoons of the Age and <unk> sitting in our shoulder .
The television works like our consciousness , <unk> and <unk> at the same time ?
To try to challenge these questions , we did a research study .
We took 50 years to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the audience , thousands of programs .
We talk to 3,000 people &apos;s almost <unk> — about 18 and 70 years , and I think it &apos;s emotionally <unk> .
How would you try to look at each one of these programs ?
Do you make a moral <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> ?
What meant for you ?
For our TED audience , I mean , this <unk> cable in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of emotional needs are universal .
And second , 80 percent of the most popular programs of the U.S. <unk> to the rest of the world .
I wish our audiences to recognize whether they feel <unk> .
I want to give you the course of two people before to spend the first slide slide : <unk> inspired even to think about the idea of consciousness and the <unk> that consciousness you can tell us on the day the day , let me go .
And so the way I &apos;m going to do the data , I want to give you the data , I want to give you the <unk> <unk> member of Hans Rosling .
Well , let &apos;s go back .
So here you see , from 1960 to 2010 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things that we &apos;re going to begin to start the state of medicine and the state of moral <unk> , which , for this study , we define the inspiration as the television shows that they make me feel better with the world .
<unk> moral are the programs that don &apos;t require the distinction between good and bad .
At principle , you see it in 1960 , <unk> <unk> .
So we see the television .
<unk> starts to mobilize .
I just just end of the end of 60 , the moral dance increases , and the <unk> .
Why ?
The city of <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> of the communist rights , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> scandal .
Look what happens .
1970 <unk> <unk> .
<unk> moral <unk> .
<unk> , more Ronald Reagan , a television president , is the control .
<unk> up to the flight .
But look , you can &apos;t , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Chernobyl .
<unk> morality becomes dominant , 1990 for the next 20 years .
Let &apos;s take a look at this .
This chart shows a similar tendency .
But in this case , we have the happiness <unk> <unk> <unk> that &apos;s social and <unk> in blue .
At that time in television we have &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the national programs that <unk> happiness .
It &apos;s going to increase . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> starts .
<unk> the social contagion increases .
We come to 1969 and look what happens .
The happiness , the <unk> and the social mutants , are not just fighting in our society , but it &apos;s called <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , which in 1969 are number two and number three .
What was the number one ?
The series <unk> socially marginalized , <unk> and Martin &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We all agree together .
<unk> responded there .
Let &apos;s look at this green peak in <unk> with the trends .
When you get the term , successful without precedent , you mean ?
I mean , in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the first program , which was the first program to say , &quot; &quot; My god , I can comment what I think of from the Vietnam War , on the president , through the television , through the television . &quot;
Well , the equal than the last graph look what happens .
1970 , <unk> <unk> . <unk> .
We don &apos;t see the television by entertainment .
The social theory and the <unk> <unk> <unk> is over 70 .
Now look at this .
<unk> <unk> ?
We have all the teachers , <unk> and <unk> , and the main program in the <unk> <unk> .
In 50 years of television that study , seven of the 10 programs were thrown out during the Cold War , five of the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
Just a generation , in 20 years , and we &apos;ve discovered , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh ,
Could we feel that ?
Can it <unk> ?
The audiences I knew , I want to tell you that the people of the digital people don &apos;t have the problems .
Archie Bunker was pasted outside of his <unk> with the rest of us .
This is another graph . In other <unk> : <unk> and imagination , who are programs tested like , &quot; &quot; <unk> of reality , &quot; &quot; and it makes me feel better .
I &apos;m going to tell you every time that <unk> and imagination will be a <unk> <unk> .
We want to see programs about people saving money and I stop ?
No . In the 1970s , we have the leader &quot; &quot; The woman <unk> &quot; &quot; who is going to <unk> the prey in 1973 , followed by the man of six million dollars , another peak of programs in control and power .
What was those programs ?
<unk> and rich .
1939 , &quot; &quot; <unk> Island &quot; &quot; .
A <unk> shows of our national psyche with just rapid and tough : the pause .
Now this , my favorite graph , because these are the last 20 years .
<unk> or not in my <unk> , sure that you &apos;ve heard or <unk> about the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
As we say this <unk> , the X brand .
<unk> , the <unk> , <unk> like &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; .
But look , the X mark .
In 2001 , in September of 2001 , Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
Why not ?
We had presidential presidential <unk> by <unk> <unk> .

They don &apos;t , they want to judge .
I can <unk> outside the island .
I can do the daughter of the <unk> Sarah Palin .
I can get there the new <unk> . You &apos;ll get it .
Great , right ?
<unk> in the very different things that are these programs , from pure entertainment , were there for 50 years — that &apos;s what I said to the principle of principle ?
We are animals , we need our counterparts .
There was no time a couple of television without a <unk> and <unk> mother .
At the 1950s , June <unk> in the <unk> program , &quot; &quot; Trust us . &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> through the <unk> of social consciousness .

In the 1980s , it &apos;s got the first <unk> <unk> .

The mother of this was , <unk> Van <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s an object or a <unk> sitting in our consciousness , sitting in your consciousness , what I know is this picture .
So all of you , women and men from <unk> , the audience of <unk> , thanks to <unk> to my favorite idea of television .
But it &apos;s also going to give you the <unk> to <unk> that if you put it in the morning to raise their ideas in our screens over these years .

In 1994 , I came in a prison card and I met a 12 year-old kid who was tortured and what he was making access to a lawyer .
And by the <unk> of the eyes I realized that the hundreds of letters that had written in the policy-makers are never given any letter to him , because it wasn &apos;t an 18-year-old boy who was doing something important for somebody .
It wasn &apos;t a political system .
It was a 12-year-old eight-year-old that would take a bicycle .
What I &apos;ve also realized was that it wasn &apos;t only in <unk> , but that &apos;s not only <unk> , but the <unk> countries in the developing world that we <unk> the right to a lawyer and the right .
And I realized I had an incredible <unk> of opportunities for all of us as a global community for all of us , and we finally realized the torture of research as research .
The kid we think about torture as a form of torture , or that &apos;s just not just for the worst yet , but in fact , the 95 percent of the <unk> today are not to offer politicians .
It &apos;s for people who are in the systems of <unk> <unk> , and unfortunately , that torture is the most accurate way of research , and it &apos;s cheaper than having a lawyer system , cheaper than having a lawyer or access access to healthcare .
The day of today I think it &apos;s possible to us is possible to us as a global community , if we take that decision , <unk> , <unk> and end of torture as a research method during our lives , but this discouraged me from three things .
First comes <unk> , <unk> power and connection is global warming .
The second is to ensure that there &apos;s a <unk> access and systematic access .
And the third is a commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I started <unk> , and if we did it ?
Could we do something about those 93 countries ?
And I founded the International Indian to <unk> who has as a specific mission to finish with torture how to torture the research of research , and they put it into practice of research <unk> in these 93 countries , we took the lawyers in a initial phase in <unk> and the courts .
However , my first experiences came out of <unk> and <unk> from my first visit to <unk> , when there was , in 1994 , still in 10 days in the country because the <unk> <unk> <unk> all .
And even 20 years later , so there was only 10 new lawyers in the country , and by so much , in a prison , not just giving you a <unk> boy , but you &apos;re going to tell you with women also and the <unk> . &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; Well , they said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to be here since 10 years because my husband committed a <unk> , but you can &apos;t find it . &quot;
The first group of <unk> <unk> , and I still remember , while I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do to research ? &quot;
And the <unk> room in silence , and finally , a woman named <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I have <unk> more of one percent of people , and I &apos;ve been able to do any research , because they all come with <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I have <unk> more of one percent of people and I &apos;ve been able to make any research , and I didn &apos;t want to
And these advocates have had a value of value to decide to decide to defend and <unk> amongst them to be able to put it into practice of these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where we came up , the 25 together , and the rest behind , and they <unk> it , and they <unk> it , whereas the <unk> left saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re going to do things in the same way that we &apos;re going to have done to the right now . &quot; &quot; But one day , the perfect case . It was a woman who was handed out of a house .
She said that he actually filmed the person to go back and I believed that I was going to take a look at them in a matter , but the police came up , and it didn &apos;t have nothing about it .
So so then she was <unk> . She had a <unk> .
And when he took his case to a judge , for the first time this <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except by the <unk> of torture and so so it &apos;s going to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the skill started to take some cases over and again and how we &apos;re going to see a little bit of starting the course of the entire story of <unk> .
But it &apos;s not true .
I used to think , then it &apos;s just <unk> ?
Or also happens in other countries ?
But it happens in so many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it &apos;s happening in so many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it &apos;s happening in so many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it happens in many countries — but it &apos;s happening in so many countries — but
In Geneva came in a prison , and there was not a 13-year-old boy , but a year after 8 years , I would have a cell phone cell .
Or a woman , I found in arms to his baby , a very beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is so beautiful ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But it wasn &apos;t a baby .
And she told me , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here for it , &quot; &quot; I had <unk> two <unk> and a iron on his baby and still in prison .
And when I went along with the conductor of prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to <unk> it .
A judge would take free off . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can <unk> it , but it &apos;s going to be my prison . The 80 percent of the two thousands of people here are without lawyers . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; And then the lawyers got the <unk> to organize a system where they could take the cases .
And we realized that it wasn &apos;t only the product of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that will reveal the difference .
For example , in <unk> , what happened was the name &#93; &#91; name <unk> &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; it was , for example , always me , but she had the same way in China , and in the same way , in China , always me think that &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a cool wind in the desert when you can <unk> . &quot; &quot; Or in <unk> , where I can remember , after a year , eight years ago with a lawyer , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk
We &apos;ve seen it , and we &apos;ve seen it , we can &apos;t help to create fairness , but we don &apos;t get rid of the resources . &quot; &quot; And then I said , &quot; &quot; But I want to convince you that the lack of resources never been <unk> to the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then with this character successfully , we &apos;ve never been <unk> to <unk> .
So , the solution that we found was that we found it was the background , and then , the <unk> access .
It took a little bit of time , and I decided to talk to another group of lawyers , and what I was thinking was that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , we don &apos;t have police in the streets , and the police is one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . The police is one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But here &apos;s a <unk> tens of millions of dollars recently in the development system system .
What is <unk> then ? &quot; &quot; <unk> with one of the development agencies , and they were forming , and it turns out that it turns out , it turns out , it turns out it &apos;s the normal trend .
It &apos;s also a manual <unk> that was really great .
And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the lawyers can come to the police station . It was perfect .
<unk> were perfectly formed .
But said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I have a question . Before we all get to the playground of the improvers , what happened with them while ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , we &apos;ll <unk> it .
And so because the key pieces are not just the product of the lawyers , but to find a way to deploy our lives systematically to be able to get access to healthcare , because they &apos;re the guarantee in the system for the people who are being tortured .
And while I &apos;m saying this , they &apos;re also aware that it sounds like a &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; yeah , of course , seems like how if I could do it , but I would like to do it in reality ?
And they &apos;re very much the reason why I think it &apos;s possible .
The first one of them is that people about the Earth in the ways of creating miracles thanks to its commitment .
And it &apos;s not just <unk> , who I &apos;ve talked to you in <unk> , but also champions all over the world that are seeing these key pieces .
We have a program called <unk> , and we realized that there were people <unk> and who wanted to help , but how we could help them ?
So so it &apos;s a line where you can win five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to win a couple of dollars if you &apos;re given to the fairness .
And there &apos;s 30 <unk> around the world , from the Sri Lankan to <unk> or the Democratic Republic of Congo , which with five billion dollars that have amazing things , through anti-poverty programs , programs <unk> and any way .
And there &apos;s not only these <unk> <unk> , but there are also people <unk> who are their contacts and how they can get them with them .
For example , in China <unk> laws that remind the cops to offer them to the people they had to be punished .
And while I was sitting in the middle of our fellow lawyers , I said , &quot; &quot; And how we can do it ? How can we be able to do this if we could ask this if we &apos;re going to get into practice ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you have money ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay , it &apos;s like this . &quot; &quot; And the 13th of the stage has three <unk> members of the Union <unk> , by 14 of the best schools in the world &apos;s Union , which is whether they were the same and <unk> posters with new laws
I &apos;ve talked about the fact that we need to form and supporting the skill .
We need to deploy the systematic form of systematic access to healthcare .
But the third and last point , the most important , is that we are dealing with this .
And usually people say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is very well , but it &apos;s too <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the reason I think this view is interesting is because that was exactly the same view that if you were going to end up to slavery or apartheid .
It started a small group of people who decided to <unk> .
One of our favorite poems of skill , which they share with themselves , is , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve done value , friends , the way we &apos;re going to be , the route is never clear , the route is never clear , and there &apos;s a lot of it , but it &apos;s a lot of it , but it &apos;s a lot of it , but in the bottom , you &apos;re not <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m safe that if we can <unk> it as a global community to support it .
And always <unk> , because I know the question is going to be , and it &apos;s going to be a pleasure to talk to you right now . &quot; &quot; But I can do it right ?
<unk> was a four-year eight-year-old when I met him in a <unk> prison in <unk> <unk> . But like <unk> in prison , everybody had a lot .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s a <unk> . And so when it <unk> started to grow , which is what they also grow ?
What was it was going to happen by the first <unk> , and the second and then then the third one , and then the third , and then we got a lot of <unk> , moved the head to power through and <unk> : from the third to the first one . And I would like to make it a whole thing to go .
And of course , I never picked up to the whole world every day , but he wanted to visit everybody &apos;s struggling , and by the <unk> , he gave his fingers through his fingers through .
Or if the cells were dark , it was like iron <unk> and giving their fingers through .
And the most part of the <unk> <unk> that was his best time and his sun , and that &apos;s always the <unk> <unk> . And I thought , here &apos;s a <unk> child .
Born in a prison of a prison without almost nothing , without a sense of materials , but a sense of its own journey to <unk> , which in my view of all of us all in one . And I told me , &quot; &quot; You couldn &apos;t do it .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I &apos;ll be the only thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ll ask you to have the only thing I can do .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Some people think there &apos;s a formula for the TED Talks , and some people think about a <unk> <unk> .
A story of childhood .
I had a personal secret .
&quot; <unk> with a <unk> called the action . &quot;
No .
It &apos;s not like this .
In fact , if you get too much of these mechanisms , you &apos;ll get a <unk> or an emotional <unk> .
But there &apos;s one thing that all TED talks have in common , and I &apos;d like to share this with you , because I &apos;m going to talk to you , because I &apos;m going to talk to you , you know , you know , you &apos;re listening to me .
<unk> with his original talks of audiences , and I learned about them to the secrets of a great talk .
And even if these <unk> and their subjects seem completely different , everyone has a common ingredient .
And it &apos;s like this : The main task as <unk> is to transfer the mind of who you &apos;ll hear a remarkable gift , a stranger , beautiful object we call it .
Let me <unk> it .
This is <unk> .
It &apos;s about giving a TED Talk , and frankly , it &apos;s <unk> .
( Video ) <unk> : <unk> Van <unk> !
( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music )
They &apos;re literally beginning to <unk> the same patterns in brain patterns .
And I don &apos;t just want to tell you that there are <unk> the same emotions .
We &apos;re going to make a look at the brain &apos;s brain &apos;s brain .
There are millions of neurons in a <unk> .
But look here , just here : a few millions are connected to each other in a way that represents a single idea .
inside the minds of the entire audience .
It &apos;s like this ; just a couple of minutes , a pattern that involves millions of neurons to one 200 minds , only with people listening to a voice and look a face .
But what &apos;s a thought ?
Well , you can <unk> it as a pattern of information that helps us understand and navigating the world .
And the ideas come in a lot of forms and <unk> , from the complex and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Here &apos;s a pair of examples I &apos;m going to show you from the TED stage .
Sir Ken Robinson <unk> is the key of our children &apos;s future .
( Video ) Sir Ken Robinson : What &apos;s going on is that creativity now is that creativity now , and we have <unk> the same status .
Chris Anderson : <unk> Hardy <unk> <unk> is beautiful .
( Video ) ( Video ) <unk> Hardy : <unk> around us , is strong , resists <unk> .
CA : <unk> <unk> <unk> people are more than a single identity .
Video : The one story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are incomplete .
CA : Well , your mind will take ideas , and you don &apos;t have random .
They are careful connected .
<unk> , make a very complex structure that is your personal view of the world .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain .
It &apos;s like <unk> in the world .
And it &apos;s estimated that millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a little component of your view of the world is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then by the green of this , <unk> it .
But if another component of your view of the world is the idea that leopards is the idea that leopards are dangerous , then the green of this is a little bit different .
So it &apos;s quite obvious that the ideas that make you make your view of the world are crucial .
<unk> that are the most insidious thing that &apos;s possible , a drive to <unk> , but wonderful world right there .
Now , the different visions of the world &apos;s world can be very different .
For example , how responds to your view of the world when you see this picture : ( Video ) Dalia Mogahed : What do you think about me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman in a faith woman , &quot; &quot; a scientist , even &quot; &quot; man &quot; &quot; ?
Or &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; a terrorist ?
CA : Whatever it is the answer , there &apos;s millions of people , there &apos;s millions of people out there .
If you look at the right way , you &apos;re able to change it , to always be able to change the world and transform their actions as much as much as the future .
What are the ideas are the most powerful force that will enhance human culture .
So if you remember that your main task as <unk> is to build an idea in your audiences of the audience , here &apos;s going to go four <unk> to address that task : First , you &apos;ll <unk> your talk to a single idea .
And the ideas are complex things ; you need to reduce the content to be able to get rid of the very simple idea that I &apos;m going to tell you , and have the chance to <unk> it .
You have to make context , share examples , that real .
So I &apos;m going to give you an idea , and I think it &apos;s a thread that you &apos;re going to take all your talk to your talk , so it &apos;s all that it spreads in a way .
According to you to tell you a reason why you &apos;re interested in .
Before I begin to build things in the mind of the audience in the audience , you have to have their permission to go into .
And what is the tool to do that ?
Curiosity .
<unk> curiosity curiosity .
<unk> questions , <unk> questions , <unk> to identify why something doesn &apos;t have sense .
If you can reveal a <unk> in view of the world of somebody else , you &apos;ll get the need to cover that ethical knowledge .
And when you make that desire is much more easy to start to build the idea .
Third , I &apos;m going to give you the idea , a piece of piece that your audience knows .
We &apos;re going to get the power of language to engaged together concepts that are already in the mind of who you &apos;re listening but not in your language , your language .
<unk> where they are .
<unk> the kid who have a lot of terms and concepts like <unk> are completely mad for their audiences .
Well , metaphors play a crucial job to show you how they fit the pieces , because it spreads in the shape of the pattern , based on an idea that you hear it .
For example , when Jennifer <unk> helped me explain this incredible new biotech called CRISPR , he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , for the first time , <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> allows it to cut and take information into genetic information . &quot; &quot; Well , a graphic explanation like this would take a very easily .
It &apos;s important , for so much , to test the talk with friends of trust , and see that parts are happier .
<unk> . Here &apos;s the end — I &apos;ve done your ideas to be <unk> .
So I want you to tell you that you do this question : What do you change this idea ?
And I need to get honest to the answer .
If the idea is just going to change you and your organization , then , I &apos;m going to say , probably not just <unk> the punchline .
The audience will see you .
But if you realize that the idea has the potential of <unk> the day or to change the view of somebody to better or inspire somebody to do things otherwise otherwise , then you have the essential ingredient to a good story , one that can be a gift for them and all of us .
There &apos;s only one 25 percent of what we &apos;ve heard .
I would argue that the <unk> every day I was going to tell you all the days of the days of the days I thought that it was <unk> every day .
( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) with this <unk> goes hard .
And the art of the conversation in the conversation , and the art of conversation , the conversation of conversation , and the art of the conversation , and the art of the conversation and the conversation about the conversation , and the art of the conversation , the conversation about the conversation , and the art of the conversation and the conversation about the conversation , and the art of the conversation , the conversation of conversation , and the art of the conversation and the conversation about the conversation , and the art of conversation and the

This is by appreciate the ordinary sounds .
For example , this is my <unk> .
We see that the ordinary sounds can be very interesting to get attention .
The sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
Imagine that you are in a street of any place of America and <unk> and <unk> , &quot; Sorry , what &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; <unk> ... &quot; &quot; — so you say , &quot; &quot; <unk> — well , this is the <unk> <unk> .
This is the street 26 , that 27 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; All right . What &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; Well , the apples you don &apos;t have names .
The streets have names , the apples only are <unk> without the name of the streets . &quot; &quot; <unk> march , a little <unk> and <unk> .
Now , imagine you &apos;re in a street of any seat in the middle of Japan , <unk> the person who you have on the side and ask questions , &quot; <unk> , like <unk> . &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the Fowler apple and that 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the streets don &apos;t have names .
The apples itself .
Look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s the apple 14 , 15 , 17 .
All of these apples have names . The streets only are the <unk> without the apples of the apples .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you know your house from your house ? &quot; &quot; El <unk> : &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is <unk> 8 .
<unk> 17 , home number one . &quot; &quot; Well , you say , &quot; &quot; All right . &quot; &quot; But walking up by the <unk> watched the number of houses don &apos;t go . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Sure .
The first house <unk> in an apple is at home .
The second house that we built is the number two .
The third is the number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious .
Like , for example , there &apos;s the doctors in China who think their work is healthy .
So every month that you &apos;re healthy , you have to <unk> , and when you &apos;re not going to pay it , you don &apos;t pay because you believe it in your job . They &apos;re very ill .
( Applause ) We are in the music thinking that the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is the same time , the beginning of the musical sentence . One , two , three , four , four .
But in the music of the west of Africa , a &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> the end of a sentence .
So let me listen to you not only in the <unk> , but in what you &apos;re saying , two , three , four , one .
And this map is also true and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s one said that you said to any true thing that you say about India , the opposite of it will be true .
So we didn &apos;t have never been doing so much in TED as another place , which for any brilliant idea that we have to have or <unk> , the same thing can be true .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
