I &apos;m going to give you an unexpected concern today .
I &apos;ve been able to change the solar system .
And I think that &apos;s my little bit of time in our genome , we &apos;re going to go up and go and do it .
So let &apos;s look at different points of view .
This is just a little bit about what we do .
ha , wait a minute .
It &apos;s a little bit of time .
( Laughter ) We just — I mean , this is <unk> — ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — I just ...
No . ( Laughter )
( Music ) That &apos;s not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
solar cells ...
Oh , Grandpa ?
Okay . Thanks .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
So I &apos;d like to tell you what I &apos;m going to do .
And I &apos;m going to do it after a couple of seconds . I hope that if your body is a little bit a bit , it &apos;s possible that if you can get your body to make sense of it , it &apos;s possible to change the importance of it .
We &apos;re very interested in language , particularly by the language of others .
<unk> us from different backgrounds : ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to be talking about , or what you &apos;re talking about is that you &apos;re going to have a simple thing , or something that you &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : That &apos;s where they &apos;re 10 years old .
This was the lucky police in the U.S.
<unk> — no . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
<unk> . <unk> .
<unk> .
It was a <unk> man .
As you can see , there &apos;s the same , and people are the same .
This is an indication that you can &apos;t believe in , and that &apos;s what happens .
And when we see our cities , we tend to be afraid of all of the things that we often believe in .
And this is , if someone tells us , with the power of force , with the force of force , it will not be saved .
In contrast , it &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing .
Have you ever been doing that ?
I found that I could have noticed that there was a lot of <unk> with a MBA in the MBA .
Some of them are leaders who are leaders in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the middle of the middle of the morning , where they don &apos;t stand up in the middle of a straight class .
It &apos;s almost the size of the two apartments .
I &apos;m going to get rid of this <unk> .
<unk> are invisible .
And as they &apos;re sitting in the room , they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> .
For me , a few seconds for myself .
The first one is , you know .
It &apos;s <unk> , which is , it &apos;s dependent on the monsoons .
So women are more than women who are older than they are .
The women often feel more vulnerable than women , and that &apos;s not the reason .
And it &apos;s dependent on either of our <unk> .
And it &apos;s very important to achieve this investment , because they &apos;re affected by their bodies .
We &apos;ve always noticed that there are always women who are always fighting .
And the fact that women and women are at the end of the course of the course of the course of the course , and the women will end up different .
I started to think that I was going to be able to read that way , which is , in fact , if you were born in this way , I was more optimistic than I was going to die .
And if you could see these videos of videos , they would have been able to participate in that kind of thing that would have been used for these kinds of things ?
There was no real estate .
So if we could make it more powerful , if we could make it more powerful , that could make us more powerful ?
We all know that our gestures and the ideas that we &apos;re thinking about , the ideas that we think about , is that we have a lot of choices and we have a lot of variation .
But the question is , the question is , is that the gesture of these gestures and the implications of the movements of these gestures .
But we &apos;re also in this way that we &apos;re going to be able to do this in the way that we &apos;re going to die .
So this is what happens in both sides .
And it &apos;s also also in the future .
We are very strong , and they &apos;re very strong , and they &apos;re very strong , and they &apos;re very strong , and they &apos;re strong , but they &apos;re powerful to be stronger .
It &apos;s not that we know that we know that we know that we &apos;re not going to die .
And I think that &apos;s the sense that I can &apos;t think about the scale of my behavior ?
And the idea and the idea is that I can &apos;t change them , but I can &apos;t tell you about the things that I can &apos;t tell them , and to me , I &apos;m going to die .
What &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> ?
It doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s strong people .
They said to them , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know .
And we need to take care of them , and we need to give them the opportunity to teach them .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there are 60 percent of them , and that &apos;s about 60 percent .
This is what we &apos;re doing .
When we hear about the moment that we &apos;re going to die at the moment , we &apos;re going to get 20 percent of the time , and they &apos;re going to get 10 percent of them , and they &apos;re going to get 10 percent of them .
They have to be able to have these changes in two worlds .
Here &apos;s what happens when you &apos;re wrong .
<unk> percent of the people who are living on the planet are <unk> by 25 percent , and they &apos;re going to get 15 percent .
The two moments that we see is that our brains are always vital , understanding that our brains are more ambitious , understanding that our brains are more ambitious , easy to understand .
This is <unk> <unk> , right ?
So , the way we can do this is to look at how we &apos;re concerned about ourselves , and you feel like , you know , it &apos;s not only for others .
They change in different ways .
And the next question is , if you think about the next few words , you can &apos;t really understand that they can make significant change .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What &apos;s the real world in real life ?
Of course , that &apos;s what we &apos;re aiming for .
<unk> , it can be used to use this <unk> to create social <unk> .
Where are you going to die ?
This is a <unk> table for a while .
For those of you who have them .
They &apos;ve been digitizing them , or they &apos;re going to work in that way .
And it turns out that if you don &apos;t think about the work of the <unk> business , because it happens to be <unk> .
So , we &apos;ve been able to <unk> them on a broad debate , and this is what happened to me , and this is what happened : &quot; &quot; Are we doing that ?
( Laughter ) Of course , this idea is denied this idea . No ! Of course , we don &apos;t know .
I can &apos;t go like this .
This is not about you .
It &apos;s because it &apos;s because it &apos;s <unk> .
What do you do when you get to your experience ?
You sit down , you sit down and eat it .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the fact that you should have to do , is that , you know , this is what you have to do .
That was what we wanted .
After all , we &apos;re going to be able to change a lot of <unk> , and then you &apos;re going to get back to a lot of work , and then you &apos;re going to get a lot of <unk> work .
I &apos;m going to have a video with five <unk> .
They &apos;re used to use them by using the tools that we can &apos;t afford to do , to make sure you can &apos;t use them .
It &apos;s more than five minutes when we &apos;re talking about the fact that we &apos;re going to die at five minutes .
Nobody is able to do that .
<unk> <unk> is called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; It increases your mind .
You can &apos;t see them like this , to see them .
And then we were flying this expedition .
They were <unk> , they were <unk> .
They were able to figure out who they were doing , and they said , &quot; &quot; We want them to work . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; If we want to go , &quot; &quot; If we want to go , &quot; &quot; If we want to go .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get to work .
And I &apos;ll be more optimistic . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the impact that &apos;s affected by this ?
This is not because they &apos;re not .
They &apos;re connected by their partners .
Let &apos;s look at them from the other side . So , how much would you be able to do it ?
Can you have a <unk> ?
This was no matter of fact .
The key thing is that they &apos;re not really interested .
People are lonely in real real time .
So they &apos;re not going to be able to change themselves .
They &apos;ve never been able to read themselves as they themselves .
It &apos;s an impact on our brains .
And when I say to people , you know , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , said , &quot; &quot; This is a little bit of <unk> ?
Tell me how much I &apos;m going to die .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not .
You can &apos;t hear anything that you don &apos;t want you to do .
It &apos;s not going to be a <unk> .
They &apos;re not known to me .
I &apos;m going to get this words very well . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d like to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m here ♫ ♫ I want to tell you a little story about my place .
At the age of 19 , I was amazed at a lot of <unk> .
They &apos;re going to get out of the window .
It &apos;s a couple of times .
I had to go back to the bathroom , and I &apos;ve got to go back to the bathroom , and I &apos;d have to go back to the Pole , and it was very painful for me , and it was very painful for me .
I was in my kitchen , because I was clever , because I think it &apos;s clever , and it &apos;s crazy .
I decided to go back to my office .
They came to me : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
And I started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; but I &apos;m not going to die . &quot; &quot; And I started talking about this , and I started talking about the fact that you have to deal with it .
I was a fully <unk> feeling .
I &apos;d like to work , I tried to work , and I &apos;d like to share with my work .
So I ended up in the courtyard .
I &apos;ve had to spend four years of my life four years when I was a member of my <unk> , and Susan <unk> said to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; So I had to deal with the conductor .
I was born .
I was 20 years old , 20 years ago in my first year .
He was night .
I was so happy to say that in the morning of the morning , I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; He told me , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; He told me : &quot; No , you &apos;re wrong , you &apos;re wrong .
I think they &apos;re going to die , and they &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s even a <unk> .
You can &apos;t see all the things you &apos;re wearing .
It &apos;s like , again , <unk> and <unk> , and in the course of my life , it was like , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which was <unk> .
I really don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very proud of you . &quot; &quot; So I did .
I &apos;ve been able to go high school for five years on a high level , and for a few years , I &apos;m going to die , you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , there &apos;s not a long time , but I was thinking , &quot; &quot; This is my place .
At the end of the first year , when I was a professor at the end of the first year , I was saying , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; And he came up with the translator , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he was good at him .
And he said , &quot; &quot; This is my house , and he said , &quot; &quot; This is my place .
And this became my return .
Because two things happened .
The first thing I realized was that I was born .
But he felt that he was smiling , and he was looking at me .
The second thing is that he had the right place .
So he would have been able to go and see it .
And I said to him , &quot; &quot; <unk> , right !
And I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the essence of my life , and it &apos;s the best thing to show itself , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to play the best . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what he did . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , a few months later , he came up to me . ( Laughter ) So a few months
It &apos;s <unk> .
And I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that .
Thank you very much .
You can &apos;t see it until one of the things that we were able to do .
I can &apos;t believe that I &apos;m going to die .
It might not be a large <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s two minutes ago .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
So , next time , I &apos;m going to try and try and do this with two <unk> , and I &apos;m going to try this , <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the best way to get in the world .
It &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> .
I didn &apos;t see what I was saying , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have to show them what I &apos;m going to tell them . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t let it go .
I said to them , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t tell them who I am , and I &apos;ll show them .
I want you to focus on the strength of these forces , and I &apos;d like to give him a little bit of attention to it , because it &apos;s very frustrating .
This is not a <unk> . ( Laughter ) This is <unk> , and we &apos;re afraid of people , because people who can &apos;t tell us about it , and they &apos;re the people who are concerned about it , and they are people who are not .
We can &apos;t use it with them , which we can &apos;t use .
Because you can &apos;t pay attention to two-thirds of the time that you &apos;re paying attention to .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have a lot of fun in the world .
And the top of them is that they &apos;re not going to die .
It &apos;s kind of like that , because they &apos;re like , you know , they &apos;re going to be able to get through the crowd .
<unk> <unk> are made up of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of money , honest and honest , for all the benefits of all the benefits of all the benefits of all the benefits of all the benefits .
So here &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> 90 percent .
Most of the things are operating .
I &apos;m going to have a couple of classes that I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;m going to spend a couple of classes going on , and I &apos;m going to spend a couple of classes going on , and I &apos;m going to get a little bit of fun , and I &apos;m going to get a little bit nervous .
And this was the reason why I was able to do this on the shelf .
I &apos;m not going to die . I &apos;m going to die .
In 1908 , when I was working on my head , I turned out to be able to go back to my head of my job .
But this time you can &apos;t see it .
<unk> and <unk> are much more fun , and they &apos;ve been able to pay attention to the fact that they can &apos;t pay attention to them .
And those days , they &apos;re going to be able to speak to our leaders , and they &apos;re not going to be social .
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been able to do with this world , which is all about this world .
I was invited in a very long city , and I was invited to be a lot of artists in the world , and I was invited to be a very elitist .
And I came up with my grandfather , which is not just because they belong to my parents .
I &apos;ve been lucky enough to get to them , in South Africa , in southern Africa , in Africa , in southern Africa .
And I realized that I was going to have a lot more people than this , because this was a big job .
After that , he &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) — that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I mean , I was a big believer in the organization , and the purpose of the organization , and the purpose of the organization , was a huge <unk> .
I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and that was brought by the minister .
Also , by the way , I was told by the fact that they can &apos;t tell them about security , and they &apos;ll be given the safety of security , and they &apos;ll be told by the fact that they can &apos;t speak .
And the other thing to do is : <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And lastly , I think this is great , and it &apos;s part of the great part of the world .
In Sao Paulo , &quot; &quot; São Paulo , &quot; &quot; in Sao Paulo , and <unk> were <unk> .
But the fact that we &apos;ve been talking about TEDx is a <unk> , which is , in fact , with a lot of TEDx doing , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So , everybody &apos;s going to die .
In two years , there were 170 <unk> , 800 <unk> and 200 <unk> , and they were saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re going to be <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be able to go back to the local community .
It &apos;s no longer the human qualities and the people who are worthy of the honor and worthy of what they &apos;re worthy of .
You can see that if you can &apos;t tell the story , you know , you can &apos;t tell the story , you know , <unk> and <unk> .
Now , we &apos;re going to tell you that we &apos;re going to be able to discover and look at other images and see them .
Try to see a whole lot of things , and without my <unk> , you can see it .
No , no , there are more than 20 million people in the world .
You can &apos;t see one of the things that &apos;s going to happen to him when you &apos;re a part of it .
<unk> <unk> , thank you .
( Applause )
I was five years old , <unk> in 1908 , <unk> in 1908 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The first time I &apos;ve been able to dive in , I was a meeting in my village , but in the light of the light at the time , I was a meeting with another <unk> , which was <unk> at all : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> plans .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But it turns out , in 1908 , the World War II <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to die .
In 1908 , Pennsylvania , I was in the middle of his village , and I was in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , to look at the world in the classroom .
And after the age of the 20th century , he began to <unk> .
My father made me a bunch of people who were saying that Islam was a very few people .
But what I found out is that people who are not good enough , and when people think they &apos;re good enough , we can &apos;t really understand that every one of us is the same as we can see .
You can &apos;t even expect to have access to anyone who can &apos;t do with each other , with each other , with each other , and to be able to have access to any extent that we can &apos;t afford them .
My father a few months ago , my father , a couple of months ago , with my father , with a couple of weeks ago , I was meeting with my grandfather , with a couple of weeks ago .
And I &apos;d like to share with you the morning .
And we didn &apos;t know if we didn &apos;t know , and then we didn &apos;t know that there was a secret that was hidden .
My father told me that my father took me away from my grandfather , and he was trying to figure out how he was going to die , and how he started getting 30 years ago .
So this morning , the last orange orange tape on the last night , came up with this little orange plate on top of it , and I &apos;m not going to end up at the end of that .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — he said .
They &apos;re all laughed at all , but in a few years , I knew what they were doing after a few years .
They &apos;re not going to be able to go through the story where they &apos;re <unk> .
These are people who spend 700 pounds on the Earth , and they &apos;re going to be able to tell the story about the fact that we &apos;ve been around 700 pounds , and that &apos;s how many of you have been able to see that there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to die of the underworld on the Earth .
And this is when I needed my own self , and I was able to do it .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — the people I call <unk> .
As I was 19 years old , I was about 20 times as I was 19 years old , and that was led to some of my patients that were rare for friends .
I would like to be able to see that if I could not be married , I would have been able to have any of you in the room with someone else .
Every time I &apos;m always a new one , I think , when you think about the kids , you know .
In the classroom , in the classroom , they were hidden in the classroom to be hidden in the classroom , but it became clear that it was obvious that , in fact , it was the greatest part of the world .
So I &apos;m going to read a lot of pieces of my head at home , when you read a book , and you can &apos;t play games .
So , I &apos;ve got a lot of people who have been involved in social communication , and I was living in my childhood , and I had no idea of living , as one of the things I had ever experienced .
And I grew up in a <unk> environment , and I grew up with a <unk> , and I grew up in a tradition of magnitude .
What &apos;s led to ?
And one of my first attempts to think about this kind of insight is that it was time for the very first time in 2000 .
<unk> <unk> software <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And as I was talking about the group of the group that I had met , I was talking about the fact that I was going to die , and I &apos;d like to be a very privileged one , and as I was talking about my life , as I was talking about my life , I was forced to fight against .
It was the people who travel across the globe .
I found that I had found that one of my senior members was a Jewish family .
I had noticed that this was not a few years ago , and I realized that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be afraid of the fact that there wasn &apos;t anything that happened to me .
I remember my friend , my friend , my friend , my friend , my friend , who was told me that I was afraid of my career , my wish for me was that I was afraid of my experience .
And the thing that &apos;s more important is that , in fact , I find a lot of great feedback that I find for you in the Silicon Valley park .
So here I was in a variety of different people , and this experience of experience , and this experience of experience , is that the emergence of the building blocks of the world .
I think it &apos;s about the fact that we have had a big part of my life , and it was the fact that we have a lot of faith in our lives , and the fact that we can &apos;t believe in all the mysteries .
So , it turns out that I have a job of gay drivers , and I &apos;ve been trying to work in one of the most vulnerable people I &apos;ve ever seen , and I think they &apos;re like , by the way I &apos;ve seen them .
<unk> . The gentleman who had a very high school in my mind was a sad story , and when I was a woman , I would like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a foreigner , &quot; &quot; and I was a woman who has to come up with me .
And I &apos;ve been able to do anything with the <unk> of the <unk> to make me with the real life of what I &apos;d like to do with my surprise .
We don &apos;t know how to be a <unk> , but because it &apos;s very good at what you &apos;re doing with our enemies , it &apos;s very good at what we &apos;re doing .
And then he started to realize , &quot; &quot; The <unk> Show . &quot; &quot; He made me honest to realize that he had been honest me about the fact that he had to be honest , and he was helping me realize that he was not at the point of religion , religious and prostitutes .
I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , the moment I &apos;m afraid , I mean , literally , the moment I &apos;m afraid of my wife .
The inspiration was very often , and in the spirit of Hebrew , in the spirit of the world , and in my tradition , I was able to believe that the world is more likely to affect the phenomenon of the world .
A day , a day , I was told I was talking about World War II , and my mother had a promise to tell me about my lifetime .
And my mother who lived long enough for life to be rescued by life , and he said to me , &quot; Don &apos;t worry . &quot;
I figured out how much energy they hate to be inside of a closet is to make energy .
I &apos;m not the real step in my mind .
When I decided to begin to begin with a new life , we were able to begin to begin with a new life when we decided to go .
Why don &apos;t you convict it , and if you don &apos;t know what ?
They &apos;re very repetitive .
And I &apos;m going to do that in that point , and I &apos;m convinced that maybe one of the reasons why I &apos;m going to die is that I think it &apos;s a little bit like me , and I &apos;m convinced that I &apos;m not at the end of the day .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> .
And I think that I can &apos;t tell you about that , and I &apos;m going to give them the horror of fundamentalism , and I &apos;m going to spend the rest of the time with the horror of fundamentalism .
I &apos;m going to be able to go through this sort of obviousness of my life , and I &apos;m going to be able to go through this sort of obviousness of my book .
Like , as simple as possible , I &apos;m going to be living in a self-employed living way , and I &apos;m going to be living in a living room , and we &apos;re living in a living room .
I wasn &apos;t like my father .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
<unk> of all .
<unk> ?
And they &apos;re going to step on on top of them , but I wanted to be honest , and somebody who was here to call their <unk> in Arabic ?
Somebody &apos;s writing ? No , no problem .
I was a little bit more than one day before I was in the kitchen and I was cooking food .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Do you have a <unk> ?
It was odd to me that I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? ( Music ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I know what ?
He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No .
&quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said .
He <unk> me on my head . He said , &quot; &quot; If you were a girl in this world , well , if you were a girl in the world , I &apos;m going to slow down . &quot;
What &apos;s the meaning of the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; ?
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> boy , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m younger boy .
Can we go to this kind of call ?
So now I started thinking .
This is my <unk> .
This is a really <unk> guy .
They don &apos;t belong to me because they don &apos;t have to be told .
Is this going to happen elsewhere ?
How do we get here ?
But there &apos;s a lot of people here , like me , which is a very good guy , which is that they only have to know about modern and cultural spirits to be able to tell us about all of modern and cultural spirits .
I am all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ?
<unk> would have been the best time for us to be the best ?
I can only tell you everything I learned in Arabic .
Would you like to be one of them ?
Here &apos;s my <unk> ?
And despite all of this , I tried to understand it .
And I &apos;d like to make him feel that he didn &apos;t like him .
The Arab language will answer the answer today .
It &apos;s not just the language of science , and it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;ve been doing , or that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in our tradition of exploration , and that &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re using , but that &apos;s not the language that we use in the air .
If they &apos;re like this , they &apos;re in our brains .
And how do I use my perspective ? We &apos;re all willing to ask this question !
You can &apos;t see that , we can use the Arab language of the Arab ?
This is a <unk> .
But there &apos;s another reality that we are in our brains .
The Arabic language is the main element .
We call it the perfect word , which is the perfect word for the other .
They &apos;re not going to be able to express the other words in Arabic .
How ?
When I first started to write , when I started writing , I started to write the Arab Emirates .
The whole idea of all of the ideas , our ideas , and our collective , the special sound of our work , is the little bit of <unk> that you can &apos;t read .
So when I started writing , when I started to write , he was there enough .
In fact , that &apos;s when you hear his handwriting from his writings , you know , when you hear his handwriting , you know .
You can imagine , you can imagine , in English , in English , in English .
And that &apos;s not a quote from anyone who was speaking .
The second thing is , we &apos;re going to say , if you don &apos;t know , if you &apos;re a <unk> , the only way we &apos;re going to die , the only way we can get it .
This is a <unk> that you &apos;ve developed .
The Germans , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> — this is <unk> .
And so they &apos;re going to be able to get rid of them .
They can &apos;t do that .
And so they can use a lot of money to do this , and that &apos;s a lot of money to improve the language .
Are we more aware of them ?
Well , we don &apos;t know from the world , and we &apos;re not in the world yet , and we &apos;re going to see that our cultural world is going to exist .
Once upon a time , it &apos;s like us , but for the development of the development , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the countries that are like , you know , <unk> and so forth , and so on .
They can &apos;t get the language of the language .
Because if you &apos;re a product or a piece of product or a piece of product , it &apos;s a part of a soul , and it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s not the local product .
You can &apos;t get your local product .
They were <unk> like the previous <unk> , the purchaser , the purchaser .
So they &apos;ve been able to make innovation and make innovation .
If I say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; can &apos;t tell you what ?
Have you ever done anything , right ?
Who and why .
Language is not just the way that language can stand , and it doesn &apos;t work .
Language is our ability to look at our brains , and our ability to interact with our brains .
So , when we say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; when we say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , there &apos;s a special image of every one of you in a special history of history .
It &apos;s not a language or two or three , or three words .
It &apos;s how we know how to look at us , how we &apos;re going to die , how we can &apos;t read it .
What &apos;s wrong ?
How can you tell the human truth ?
So , if you say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; The father , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; Dad , you know ?
What do you feel ?
If you &apos;re a problem , it &apos;s good , and I &apos;m going to get away from where I &apos;m going to die .
And this is what you &apos;re talking about , that we can &apos;t do something special to us .
I have a friend of mine who &apos;s married to me .
So one day I said , how do they work ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is good . &quot; &quot; But I said , &quot; &quot; Everything is good . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not a woman . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And the woman in college , women said , &quot; &quot; The woman , &quot; &quot; and then , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and then the promise of all the word .
He said , &quot; &quot; How can we possibly be a person ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; How can we be a person ?
Who would like suicide ?
&quot; &quot; <unk> me ? &quot; &quot; This is one of a few generations .
So we started thinking , because I was a woman who said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a woman , and I &apos;m going to ask him to deal with him . &quot; &quot; So she was <unk> .
My friend said to me , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say to me , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say when I &apos;m going to die when I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; And the woman who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a woman , &quot; &quot; for him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say this woman
To me , to me .
( Applause ) So what do we do to protect the Arabic language ?
We &apos;re going to be able to do this , and we &apos;re not going to be able to tell the Arab language to protect the Arab language .
And while many people said , &quot; &quot; Why would you be wrong ?
It &apos;s about forget and it &apos;s for the sake of death . &quot; &quot; The problem is .
The Arab language of Arabic , which was called the Arab language , said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to die .
We &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; No , no . We &apos;re going to be doing that . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to get rid of this stuff , because this way we can &apos;t cope with us .
And one of the guys I &apos;m going to talk to me is , I hate Arabic .
We are grateful that we have to change our lives , and we &apos;re going to be able to understand that we &apos;re going to change our lives , and we &apos;re going to be able to see that we &apos;re going to change our lives .
We &apos;re going to live like us , and we &apos;re going to see that we &apos;re going to change our lives .
So I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die of my servant , &quot; &quot; but you know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a titan .
Very simple , very simple , creative and understandable .
And after that , we started with a different kind of insight that was written in our brains .
You &apos;ve seen this <unk> on top of you , black and yellow , and on top of the yellow bar , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Why ? In fact , I &apos;m wrong .
We &apos;re in our language .
If we &apos;re on the language of our language , we &apos;re going to get rid of our brains .
We &apos;re not going to be able to speak .
We &apos;re not going to be able to go back .
This is a very serious chance that we have a chance to be modern and our age .
And after that , we &apos;re going to get rid of the boys and girls in the Arab world .
They &apos;re like &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Girls and girls .
We &apos;re very much known .
And he says , &quot; &quot; Aha , you &apos;re like &quot; &quot; Aha , &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; Aha . &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , no . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Tell me , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Give me a little more sense that I can &apos;t explain it .
I &apos;m going to go to the website &quot; &quot; Internet . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because that &apos;s because it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
But as we &apos;re talking about this , we can &apos;t believe that if you &apos;re serious , and if we don &apos;t think about it , we don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to be bigger than we &apos;re going to get bigger , or you can &apos;t tell us that , you know , we &apos;re going to get to control and tell us that , you know .
It &apos;s not going to be a <unk> .
If we can go to the universe , or on the front lines , and maybe we can be creative .
So what you &apos;re doing right now is a creative twist .
It &apos;s a leap of creativity in your main sense of creativity .
Let &apos;s ask if we are .
Let &apos;s write a novel or a short movie .
And that &apos;s what we can do in the process .
It can lead to a cause of the Arab language again .
I mean , there &apos;s no way to say , &quot; &quot; No , there &apos;s no way to say that there is no way .
But we &apos;re going to die , and we have the way to be a part of the way , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to call a part of that way .
What can you do this day ?
<unk> , who are you ?
And I &apos;m also asking you to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; or in Arabic , or a Chinese , or a Chinese .
But in Arabic in Arabic , I was able to write a lot of mixed in Arabic .
( Applause ) This is <unk> ! It &apos;s not language .
You &apos;re going to get into the world with your own language .
It &apos;s not easy for us to go back to a soul like this .
It &apos;s the first thing we can do .
The second , there &apos;s lots of other things we can do .
We &apos;re not going to be here today to be able to stand here .
We can &apos;t believe that the language of this language can &apos;t be applied to your attention .
Now , I &apos;m a neuroscientist .
It was the first time in the first time , with the first time in language .
In my mind , I said to him , &quot; &quot; This is your experience , &quot; &quot; which I said to him , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your fault . &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your job . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s my job . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Applause ) Now , if you think of ourselves this cultural imperative . ( Applause )
So a few years ago , the American National Geographic ran out of the U.S.
I found a couple of things that I found out of these 30 days .
And instead of all around the world , it was the only time I &apos;ve been able to get out of it .
For me , I was a painting every day for a month .
I can go back to 30 days .
And I also found that , I also found myself , that , that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that
And by the way , this is the words that you can &apos;t do with your daily words .
But you can &apos;t read novel .
It was so mystifying .
I didn &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to know .
No , if I can tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
And so I found that small , ladies and gentlemen , was very much more likely to be able to do that , and that was a lot of the probability of being able to make it work .
Actually , they &apos;re very repetitive .
( Applause )
The first day I started with my first day , and I was afraid of the first day .
I started to be a very good Samaritan , and I started talking about the fact that I was talking about , and I started talking about the fact that there was a student full of students , and I started talking about the fact that I was working on the road .
This is a very humbling , high-volume , <unk> student , a great visualization student .
But in fact , I &apos;m very proud of myself , and I &apos;m very proud of my work , and I &apos;m not going to be afraid of the men , the men , and I can &apos;t tell my story .
But this is what we call <unk> <unk> .
He was so convincing that it was so convincing , and I didn &apos;t know if I was a teenager , and when I first saw my first birthday , I was able to predict when I was born .
So , as I &apos;ve been talking about , I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; came up with a voice of time , and when they came to the room , they said , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to go next .
No , no , no , no , no , no man .
And if you don &apos;t think about it , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s <unk> .
It was an inflection point .
And when I was born , I was able to tell you everything about my third hand , and I &apos;m going to get everything from my third hand .
&quot; It &apos;s going to go . &quot;
I &apos;m going to die , and I &apos;m going to die for a while , and I &apos;m going to die for some years , and I &apos;m also thinking , &quot; &quot; That is , &quot; &quot; which is the sound of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
For example , for example , I think I was a little bit skeptical about the fact that I &apos;m not , for example , my voice , and my real estate teacher .
I was not going to be able to hear me , but I was angry , but I was afraid of my life , and I felt like I &apos;d been talking about the fact that I was going to die , and I felt like I was going to die .
And I gave him a story about my grandfather and he came out .
And it turns out that the people who were able to do it with this is that the normal people were able to make sounds , and I was a serious story .
He started with a little bit of the sound of his voice , and he blew my mind , which blew my mind , it blew my life , and I gave a second of the second largest <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;ve seen <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;ve seen <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;ve seen <unk> <unk> , and I saw <unk> <unk> <unk> , and as he <unk> , he sat down on the sidewalk , and he sat down on the sidewalk , and he sat down on the sidewalk , and he sat down on the sidewalk , and he sat down on the sidewalk , and he sat down on the sidewalk , and he sat down on the sidewalk , and he sat down on the sidewalk , and he sat
I needed this curiosity , and I needed my support , and I started talking about it .
My voice is at that moment .
And I think it &apos;s like a sad situation , and he looked at me as well as he looks at , and he looked at it as well as I said , well , it &apos;s going to be like that .
For example , when I was student in college , I would like to be a student from college campuses , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I want you to go back , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I want you to go .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die .
And the answer started to slow down the speed of uncertainty .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , one of the most exciting : myself and the spirit of the <unk> , the sense of self , became a sense of vulnerability .
It started with my grandfather , not because of the fact that it was my grandfather , but it started with the fact that it was a <unk> , and it started with her .
This was a <unk> <unk> , which was a <unk> <unk> , and it started with the number of numbers , and it started with the number of times , the number of drivers and <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> , and the sounds of this part of the world is a little bit <unk> .
For example , if you were to see that I was able to find myself that I &apos;m going to be able to find myself that I &apos;m going to be able to find myself that I &apos;m going to die of my life , and they can &apos;t tell my life , and it &apos;s like , it &apos;s very strange , like , a little bit like this .
First of all , for example , for example , for example , for example , when I was three to three decades , I was more than three times as many as I was later talking about , and particularly in the dramatic centuries .
Where is the tenor of your body ?
No , no , I was going to put that water on the top of that water at the same time , &quot; &quot; I rang up , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s in the picture .
Eventually , I came up with my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and I didn &apos;t have the courage to create this costume , and I was forced to create my parents .
Two years later , he began to <unk> .
Now , I was interested in all the time , and there was a lot of attention , and the horror of the horror , the strange , the bizarre , the deal .
I had a meeting in my mind , and I became a preacher for the truth , and he became a preacher , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get it more comfortable . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , you &apos;re more comfortable . &quot; &quot; He was <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; he was a physicist , and I was so excited that I was so proud of it , and I was so disappointed that
Now , if you &apos;re going to die , you &apos;re going to see that in fact , you &apos;re going to die , and in fact , you &apos;re going to get a little bit of it .
I &apos;m going to be able to read a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to get rid of my <unk> , and I &apos;m going to get rid of it , and at the end of the day , I &apos;m going to be able to get a wobble that I &apos;m going to be able to do .
Many more people have been wasted to me , and they &apos;re not happy , but they &apos;re very weak , and they &apos;re very weak , and they &apos;re very weak and they &apos;re very weak .
And my mother and I didn &apos;t know about the fact that I could be rescued by the other voice , and I &apos;d like to ask him how much of the time I had ever met , and I would have been ready for this one day , and I would have been ready for this for a while , and I &apos;ve been ready for this for a while , but I &apos;ve been talking about the greatest lesson of my life , which is : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
And it turns out , when it turns out .
Sometimes , if you don &apos;t think about it , I &apos;m going to die like this , the absolute spring , the absolute spring . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk . I &apos;m 14 years old , and I &apos;m going to come back to me for me to come back to me for me , and it &apos;s not enough enough for me to tell you why this works .
But they &apos;ve been able to have the courage to get out of the horror of the deer , but they &apos;ve got to know that there &apos;s a little bit more likely to be <unk> .
I would argue that if we could take me to save me , I would ask you to think about the fact that we &apos;ve been able to change my life , and the most fundamental thing is that we need to be able to deal with something , and most of the most often , the most important thing , and the most fundamental thing , I know , was the answer , and the most fundamental thing is , it &apos;s not a <unk> , but it &apos;s not a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it
Of course , I didn &apos;t have a lot of attention to this , and it was difficult to realize that it was difficult to realize that the first important step was to make the first step in the first step .
For example , for example , I &apos;ve found that I &apos;ve found out that I could not be able to speak , but I &apos;ve found that I &apos;ve found that the truth and the truth , not like that , but I &apos;ve found that I can &apos;t believe in real and sense .
I used to tell them .
I &apos;m not going to be able to speak at a night where I could sit down for a night where I could sit down for a night where I was real .
I had a lot of money to do with my books , and I &apos;m not going to be able to build a lot of my work , but I &apos;m going to hear that you &apos;re going to die , you know , if you &apos;re going to die , you &apos;re going to sit down .
They say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t work .
Do you have the plastic bags ? &quot; &quot; And I was a woman .
As I was talking about my life , I was a little bit more important , like <unk> <unk> , which was more important than I was talking about : &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I was trying to thank them , because I was trying to thank them , because I realized that I didn &apos;t know how much of my time , but I was trying to thank them , and I was trying to thank them , and I don &apos;t think it &apos;s not a reason to do it .
And I started to ask them , and I started to ask them , but I started to ask them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to use the answers , but I started to figure out what I &apos;m going to do when I was trying to figure out what I &apos;m going to be learning to find out of the world .
I found all of this stuff that was going to take all of this stuff , and I &apos;ve found that all of this was going to be solved , and I &apos;ve found that I &apos;ve been able to deal with them , and I &apos;ve found that I could not be solved , and I &apos;ve found that I can &apos;t solve it , and I &apos;ve found that I &apos;ve found that all of that , and I &apos;ve found that the people who are going to be able to solve the <unk> , the <unk>
And when I was born , he was able to get these wounds and turned it out , and that was the fact that I was very proud of the fact that my favorite person , and the fact that I was at the bottom of the world , was that I had discovered that there was a lot of compassion , and I &apos;ve discovered that the most compassionate and <unk> sense of compassion needs to be understood .
And after the realization that , you know , I &apos;m going to die , you know , <unk> in the parts of my closet , and I &apos;m going to get rid of that , okay , you know , that &apos;s okay , that &apos;s okay .
For the first time , 10 years after the sound , I was able to say that I was the most abundant <unk> in the history of the 20th century , and I became very high , and a year after a year — I got the highest number of airplanes .
And one of the reasons I was looking at my grandfather was to tell me when I was born .
The truth of the truth is that they can &apos;t work with them .
As he said , &quot; &quot; I mean , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; as I said , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I
At the same time , we have to know that we can &apos;t get to two .
And I continue to think about the health of the health of the elderly , the book , the book , the book , and then I continue to build a book , and I continue to think that the most important question is , the most important question is , is not the wrong question .
I &apos;ve learned that all over the world , I &apos;ve found them , and I found them in the sense of compassion , and I found that compassion is not a sense of compassion , and it increases the sense of mercy and compassion .
And I &apos;m not going to be able to help me with a woman who doesn &apos;t know about the fact that I &apos;m going to be afraid of a woman who doesn &apos;t want to be a woman who doesn &apos;t want to be a woman who doesn &apos;t want to be a woman who &apos;s going to die .
What we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to be able to do this from the moment that we &apos;re going to die at the bottom of the 20th century , and when you &apos;re a professor of Professor <unk> <unk> , which is based on &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is based on the path of Professor <unk> and Dr. <unk> <unk> , which is , as opposed to our <unk> , it &apos;s not like <unk> , but it &apos;s important , it &apos;s important , it &apos;s important , it &apos;s important
<unk> and understanding the qualities of the law and the voice of the sound , the voice of the sound , is that you can &apos;t tell them what was worthy of you .
We can &apos;t create these sorts of societies , even though we can &apos;t have a society .
And there &apos;s a kind of <unk> , which is , in the back of the world , we have to go back .
It &apos;s not a <unk> person .
It doesn &apos;t have to be <unk> people .
For me , I think it &apos;s because of the fact that we don &apos;t think about the fact that they &apos;re not talking about the fact that they don &apos;t have to be religious and fear , but they don &apos;t just talk about justice , but they don &apos;t just talk about it , or you know .
In the last 20 years , we &apos;re going to die in five countries , and we &apos;re going to die in 26 countries , and we &apos;re standing there in 26 countries , and we have hope that we need to change the possibilities of the people who are going to die , and we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
As he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is the ability to use people to have the capacity of the human race , which is the ability to use the people in the world .
Now , this is a long time for the world , to make sure someone who needs to be married , to be aware of someone who needs to be concerned about the fact that someone who needs to be proud of , and I can hope that they can hope .
We &apos;re not going to be able to go through our hearts and our organizations , and they &apos;re not going to be able to go back .
We &apos;re going to die . We &apos;re not .
It &apos;s not going to be <unk> , and it &apos;s not a <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> .
As I said to me , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what you &apos;re talking about when you &apos;re born .
I &apos;m going to ask you about your family . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
Let me tell you about the future .
But that &apos;s why ?
Because , of course , this is not a picture of the needle .
And yet , when I first started my first school , I started when I was 15 years old .
And in fact , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , but in a very different way , in a very different way , I was able to get through the process of the process , which is a process when you &apos;re using the camera .
If you &apos;re in your pocket , you &apos;re going to be ready , you &apos;re going to be ready .
And for me , it &apos;s not just about the right place .
I &apos;d like to think that everyone can do this .
So , I wanted to create something different from this , and it &apos;s something that &apos;s starting to show up after the painting .
Here &apos;s what this is : This is what we &apos;re going to have on a road in the way .
But it has become an unexpected game .
And yet , it looks close to me .
Or you &apos;re looking at pictures like this — but it &apos;s a little bit colored on the dark side , but it &apos;s all that you &apos;re looking at .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> .
Because of course , this is not really the image of us that we &apos;re not really interested in , but you &apos;re able to see the camera in the camera with a camera in the camera .
Let &apos;s have a little bit of light to deal with our kids .
So this is really a moment when you can &apos;t really think of the right idea .
Well , how do we make the real flute ?
Do you know that if you don &apos;t know ?
Are they going to die ?
What does that make ?
And yet , sometimes we were able to make it disappear .
But at the end , the way we deal with the world is how to deal with the world .
It &apos;s not really what we &apos;re doing , but it &apos;s really really what &apos;s really important to us .
So the basic idea is really .
And I see that when I was able to do this , a real understanding of what I was trying to do with a real set of things , a reality , a reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
And there are three numbers of these numbers , which are very , very precisely , in terms of how they &apos;re connected in 3D .
But in a certain way , it looks like the object that exists there , and it looks like this .
And so we know that there may be exist .
So they don &apos;t play games , because our brains don &apos;t have the meaning of our brains .
And I see the same process as well .
And this is actually what we &apos;re going to do in different <unk> .
So the real picture is the real thing , I think , anything that I think I &apos;d like to think about , everyday stuff , is that they &apos;re going to die .
And I &apos;m really excited about it , and I &apos;m really excited about it , because if you &apos;re not , it looks wrong .
And what I want to do is we have three simple laws that we have to follow , and we have three simple laws .
As you can see , these images have no special part .
But it doesn &apos;t matter .
So the first law needs to be the same as the first rule of vulnerability .
The second is the same , the <unk> must be the same .
And in both of these cases , these two identities — the same winds and the same pattern .
And the third thing is , if you can see the pattern of one of the images , where you can see where someone came to know where they arrived .
And it &apos;s like , how do you change your behavior in the way that you &apos;re going to die .
And we &apos;re building the color between the images between the images and the images , the colors , the colors , the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and then , in one way , there &apos;s hundreds of thousands of them , and yet , in one way , there &apos;s hundreds of thousands of neurons .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) Now , people would think that this is the size of this , and you might think that &apos;s the bottom line .
But in fact , this is a picture of a completely different way of being able to do it differently .
And I think it &apos;s a place where you can create a place , a place where you can &apos;t get a place in that way , even if you don &apos;t have a place in that way .
But it takes a lot of money .
And I knew this idea was a couple of months to find places where you can &apos;t read and see pieces of space , and I knew how many months to find these pieces of space .
For example , the fish is a little bit from the <unk> .
And it &apos;s different .
It &apos;s a little bit taken from a treadmill on a treadmill .
And yes , there &apos;s no way that the island of the island of the island of the island to make more of the Swedish <unk> <unk> house .
So , I think it &apos;s possible to get close , and I think it &apos;s possible with the <unk> .
Every time you &apos;re an economist , it starts with a microscope .
And then they bind to the different formats .
In this kind of way , every single piece is very good .
And it &apos;s very beautiful , and the result is a very beautiful , and it can be really a really cool thing .
So we have all the characteristics that we need to do , and the only thing that we need to do is cause us .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Chris Anderson : Julian Anderson : Julian <unk> .
And this is an information that was given so much information that allowed you to be in the last few years , and in the last few years , the whole world will have more information .
Is this <unk> ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , that &apos;s right ?
The rest of the world is right ? Isn &apos;t that good at the time of the world , right ?
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people think about this ?
How do you care about our lives ?
JA : These are the kinds of information that we can share with these data , and they have different ways to tell us that these realities are <unk> .
What we &apos;re doing to do is to take care of the information that you &apos;re comfortable with , to make sure that they &apos;re comfortable with the data , and we &apos;re in a country like this in Belgium , and in fact , if you &apos;re in the country .
And if you think about it , or if you think it &apos;s simple , you have to think about it as a matter of good news , but it &apos;s a little bit more difficult than it is — it &apos;s a little bit difficult — and it &apos;s possible that it &apos;s possible , and it &apos;s possible for the political hangers-on .
CA : So I mean , you know , it &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
JA : <unk> . It &apos;s rare if you don &apos;t expect them to be rare , if you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to die .
( Music ) <unk> .
( Laughter ) CA : Well , I think I &apos;m going to ask you the code of <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
Let me take the point of view .
This is what happened a few years ago .
Let &apos;s take this picture .
It was a story .
Would you like to tell this story about how I can teach this story ?
JA : This is <unk> <unk> .
In 2004 , after 2004 , it was <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
In 2004 , Kenya was 18 years old , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He was <unk> <unk> .
And when we started talking about corruption , when we started talking about the fact that we &apos;ve had two million hectares , they &apos;ll be able to get rid of these together .
The government has been used by the government , and the government now has used the political force against political force .
It &apos;s like a <unk> book in Kenya .
In 1908 , 28 years ago , I &apos;d go to my <unk> , and I couldn &apos;t get it .
This is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> Daniel <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , three days later , and he was going to die after that , and then we had to go to the ceremony .
CA : It &apos;s a long way to play in a long way , not a long way to play in the <unk> of Kenya , not the way , and I &apos;m going to get it out of the road .
JA : Yeah . When did we go back to the date before we were born , and then I was in the history of the 20th century in Africa , in Africa .
He came up with his grandfather .
In a couple of days , a few days in Kenya , a couple of days was comfortable writing .
So 20 days in the Kenya of Kenya , the <unk> of Kenya , and the fact that we can &apos;t afford the safety of Kenya , it &apos;s a condensable in the world , and it &apos;s a condensable in the process .
CA : So the data is really changing the world ?
JA : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : So this time , I &apos;ve got a video about the weather stations .
This is a little clip of a video which is a little clip .
I mean , in this video , there &apos;s a little bit of <unk> in this video .
<unk> : ... <unk> , one of the one I was in .
Now , it seems to be <unk> , it seems to me .
<unk> . <unk> .
It &apos;s just the news that we see when we see .
They &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> !
( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to go ahead .
<unk> ... <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They needed to go .
We &apos;re going to die at 8 .
We have two partners , we continue to work .
Right . They all died .
<unk> , who &apos;s talking about <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> .
CA : So how did that be the effect of this video ?
JA : This is a hardship for people who are <unk> .
We were two-thirds of the time that we &apos;re talking about this video .
This is actually one of the three engineers .
CA : Are you a <unk> of all of this <unk> , who are the World War II , who are two-thirds of the time ?
JA : Well , two Crime worker died , who was two children injured .
And he died , and the man who died .
CA : Well , this is what led to a wide variety of things .
So , what was the big part of this ?
JA : We don &apos;t know , I think people are going to die .
And if you can &apos;t see that , there was no reason that people were walking on the road , and there was no reason why they can &apos;t swim , but without any reason , you can &apos;t get saved .
They had two <unk> and their businesses , and their businesses .
CA : Well , the answer to the US security economist is the answer to the answer , which is that I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m not going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;ve been able to tell you about the fact that I &apos;ve been trained in the U.S.
Right ?
JA : We &apos;ve done that by denying the experiment .
Five days ago , there &apos;s 150 to 150 people who have existed before , after five days .
And this year , I was able to see the majority of the United States of America , the United States of America , is that they don &apos;t have access to it .
I was born in my mind .
CA : If the US government was <unk> <unk> ?
JA : Get them off . ( Applause ) JA : Yeah . ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : What are you ? ( Applause ) JA : So what do you have ?
The secret of the secret is that we have this kind of <unk> .
CA : So you &apos;ve had a little bit of detail about this .
<unk> , what do you have ?
What are you doing right ?
JA : Well , there &apos;s this question for the world , which is that it &apos;s important to deal with the world .
Well , it &apos;s very much .
It &apos;s going to happen if you &apos;re in the economy of economic , and you &apos;re going to be able to have a new and 25 percent chance to be able to deal with the fact that you &apos;re going to have to go to the next level , and that &apos;s how you can share the information that &apos;s available .
It &apos;s always happening . The history of capitalism depends on it .
CA : But if you don &apos;t have a little bit of time , it can be a little bit of a <unk> , when you &apos;re in the temporal lobe , and it can be <unk> for all the community .
JA : Well , I &apos;m going to see that in my mind .
So , we have <unk> <unk> .
And I have some personal experience , which is , you know , your team is connected to the ground .
There &apos;s a number of supernormal stimuli — such as it was like , <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not about the fact that we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
CA : All right , they &apos;re all right .
If the son of the son of America is to tell you that if the son of America is telling you , he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; You know , if you could do that , you know ?
People are showing that the people who are not interested in our brains are coming .
This is what millions of people in this world are not in the world , but it &apos;s not just that .
It &apos;s not like my son . What is that gesture ?
JA : Well , this is very , very much .
But you don &apos;t need to believe that the people , the <unk> , the people , the people , the people who don &apos;t have access to these efforts , they don &apos;t need to go every single day .
It &apos;s not the idea of their own idea . It &apos;s not a <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t work .
And every day , it &apos;s like that .
And it &apos;s not going to change the people in the world , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
CA : So what you &apos;re saying is that you can &apos;t see a way of the destruction of the state of the government and the secret to the Arab world .
It &apos;s good .
But it &apos;s very strange that it &apos;s very strange that you can &apos;t believe in your life , for example .
JA : It doesn &apos;t really matter . It &apos;s probably not .
Or there &apos;s no reason that we can &apos;t even make a match .
If you &apos;re in the middle of your life , it &apos;s difficult to do , for us , for us , for us , to help us do what we need to do , to help us improve their lives .
CA : So I &apos;m interested in the fact that I &apos;ve been talking about — what do you think about this ?
There are two types of ideas and Julian <unk> .
One is — you know , <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> .
Who thought about it ?
Why are you going to die ?
JA : Well , it must be a few guys .
CA : These <unk> guys , Julian .
I &apos;m a little bit more <unk> . I &apos;m a little bit bored .
I think it &apos;s still the moment I think , but I &apos;m not going to die .
Right ? Is it a strange <unk> ?
Is this <unk> ?
JA : This is a <unk> <unk> .
In the last last year , I &apos;ve been meeting in the Gulf of Mexico , and it was like the Gulf of Mexico , and it &apos;s not as powerful as it is .
We had an engineer , and we had an engineer , and we had an engineer , and we were able to save the burden of the burden of the company in the <unk> .
And I was afraid , and I have the courage to get there .
And there was no excuse with them , and it was not a <unk> .
They didn &apos;t know who they were writing .
It &apos;s a little bit more than the oil sector , the <unk> of the oil .
And so , if you look at the story , the answer is , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re a little bit old .
We can &apos;t see how we can &apos;t read it .
Well , it &apos;s good . It looks good , but we can &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; We can &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; We can &apos;t . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to find a little bit like this , &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; We want to find our egos . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; We want to find a little bit of information .
Have you ever been talking about ?
What are you going to tell you about ?
What &apos;s really wrong ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re the answer to the <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is the answer to the recipient &apos;s office .
I can &apos;t see that .
( Applause ) It &apos;s very much like this .
One of the ways that we can &apos;t explain to a certain extent is one of the ways that we write to write letters .
CA : Can you have a <unk> ?
JA : Well , it &apos;s also very , very well , and they &apos;re going to be able to do it now , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
And for the last few months , for the last few months to protect the public , we need to be able to change the way that we &apos;re going to change our lives .
This is a little problem .
And as we started with the other new <unk> , we &apos;re not going to be able to see that there &apos;s a lot of time , and there &apos;s a lot of money , and it doesn &apos;t have enough opportunities to make all this data , but it doesn &apos;t have to be good enough .
CA : I mean , I &apos;m going to tell you about the main act of the main movement or whether you want to ?
JA : Yeah . <unk> people .
And the data is to grow up in a very different way , a lot of ways to grow up in a very different way , and we need people to be able to deal with , and we need to be able to deal with the fact that we need to deal with the power of security .
CA : So , why don &apos;t you tell you why ?
I &apos;m going to wipe down the floor , which is 37 feet away .
Is that data ?
JA : So I had to call the <unk> film , and we were the result of the religious Reformation .
( Laughter ) CA : Well , you know , you &apos;re going to have this rug , and I think we &apos;d be a little bit like someone else .
JA : Can you think about the movie ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : Well , you know , when you &apos;re older , you &apos;re also in the middle of your childhood , you know , the problem is , you know .
JA : Yeah .
I was a young teenager .
And the reason I &apos;ve done is that I can &apos;t tell you about the fact that young young men were born .
It needs to be a little bit of <unk> .
There are different kinds of things that we can &apos;t see .
Now , unfortunately , most of the time I think about the fact that most of the time was in the Russian press , I was able to calculate the tuition .
It &apos;s not like <unk> <unk> .
CA : Well , you know , I &apos;m going to say , you know , what you &apos;re going to say is that you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do with you . What is the key ?
And you can write a quick information about them , and you can write this thing about why ?
JA : Well , I think that &apos;s what I think .
But the main thing is : I think it &apos;s important , and the people who don &apos;t think they &apos;re going to die ; they help us .
And I think to me , this is what I thought about when I was afraid of my story , and that &apos;s what happened to me .
CA : Well , the answer is , if you &apos;re wrong , you &apos;re not going to see them in the human genome ?
JA : I &apos;m a little bit worried that if you &apos;re a little bit skeptical , you can &apos;t see them , you know , <unk> , but in the way — that &apos;s how they found people who had found out there .
This is what I have for a long time .
CA : Would you be willing to speak to the last few years where the last few months ?
And there was the problem that I could see there , because it was allowed to be able to figure out the information that was able to get information out there .
And you know , it &apos;s <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get the good fortune . Then what happened ?
JA : This was a big issue .
It was the economic crisis .
The world was one of the greatest challenges in the world .
The banks were 10 times the size of the banks .
This information is <unk> in the last year .
And when I was five years old , I was amazed at the fact that I had lost five years ago , like <unk> <unk> , and he started to know about five years ago , and they didn &apos;t know what they were , and they didn &apos;t know what they were , and they didn &apos;t know what they were .
I couldn &apos;t believe that I could not be able to go to college , but I &apos;m pretty nervous about what I &apos;m going to go next to you .
Everyone was able to figure out a lot more than this , and I was able to make sure that this is a new law , and it &apos;s based on a new law , and then it &apos;s been applied to a new law of law enforcement , which is one of the greatest challenges in the world , which is one of the greatest challenges in the world , which is one of the greatest challenges in the world .
And I think it &apos;s like , you know , <unk> in the middle of nowhere .
And one month ago , this law was agreed to be considered hidden .
CA : <unk> .
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> , Julian <unk> .
How can we be able to do it ? &quot; &quot; And the great thing is that it &apos;s going to take control of the Big Bang , or whether it &apos;s going to be possible , people are going to be looking at the Big Bang of the Great Wall ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s going on .
The whole thing is <unk> , and all of the things that we &apos;re talking about , and all the names of all the places you &apos;re talking about .
It &apos;s hard to see how you &apos;re going to die .
So we &apos;re going to change a lot of interesting things that we live in , and we can change everything .
CA : You know what you &apos;re talking about , you know , I &apos;m Julian , you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> , you know .
JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m not .
I &apos;m going to write a story and a novel is my book , and I &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about the story of my story , and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of view of what I call <unk> .
But let me tell you before , let me tell you about my personal experience .
Of course , I &apos;m using it , I &apos;m going to be able to use it as well , but I &apos;m not going to have a couple of nights <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a little bit of time when I &apos;m going to die , and I &apos;m not going to be able to do it .
When I was about the time we wish to be a single parent parent , it was a mother .
In the 1970s , there was a little bit odd to be in the 1970s .
Most of the time , many of them were the vast majority of our family members who had a family in our family .
In fact , there &apos;s no more than ever since .
In a place on the side , the <unk> , the <unk> of the modern , <unk> woman .
But on the other hand , it &apos;s always the same , religious , fewer people , just like the religious Reformation .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> are the most profound <unk> , people who are <unk> , who are <unk> .
Every time I &apos;m going to be able to see the fact that we &apos;re going to be able to see the fact that we &apos;re going to be able to get the red count on the number of dragonflies .
Then I can &apos;t get away from the end of the closet .
A week after a week , they were able to get sick to get sick .
Now , I know that I can &apos;t tell the science of science , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at , and that &apos;s how people come next to me to be able to come up with somebody else , but they &apos;re going to be able to get people out of themselves , and they &apos;re going to get away from them .
I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; what was the power of this <unk> ?
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Of course , there &apos;s <unk> , but it &apos;s the power of the foundation . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a lot of important lessons . There &apos;s a lot of important lessons , but if you don &apos;t think about it , it &apos;s a lot of important lessons , but if you don &apos;t think about it , you have to take it away from the <unk> , or the soul of the person , or the soul .
They &apos;re <unk> .
Each one of us is a social and cultural revolution .
We all live .
We all have a certain kind of view , a ring , a ring that belongs to me .
But if you &apos;re living in the world where we &apos;re living in the world , we &apos;re going to be able to connect with the risk of being able to grow up in a remote way .
We can &apos;t control the power of our lives . We can &apos;t go away from the fact that we can &apos;t live much longer .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> us , is that we can &apos;t get away from that , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
And the women like this , and the women are like this , they &apos;re going to get a little bit like a piece of paper , or I &apos;m going to get bored , or you can &apos;t see any of them .
This is what we &apos;re facing , which is a lot of people who exist , and a lot of people have been able to share their own lives .
And even though the world is born , it &apos;s one of the greatest challenges of our world , which is one of the greatest challenges of our world .
And this is where every place is happening , between the bureaucracy and the Turks , and the rest of the world , and the rest of the time , and the rest of the world .
They &apos;re going to be able to be able to speak up , and I can &apos;t tell you about the rest of the time , and I &apos;m going to talk about it .
In my mind , it &apos;s the main way to create this cultural phenomenon that I can &apos;t believe in .
Stories can &apos;t go to college when you don &apos;t think about it .
So , looking at these images , we can see the worlds of other worlds .
I started to write stories from eight .
And one day my mother gave me my mother , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d have a good idea .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you that we &apos;re going to get a little bit of insight from the idea that I think you &apos;re going to do .
He was good at home , and he was good at home , but he was not very good at all .
I was going to be able to talk about the fact that my parents were going to talk to me about the fact that my parents had to look at , and my mother was a kid . My mother was a kid .
But that didn &apos;t know that I had been thinking of my life , that was my life , that was my life , and what I &apos;d like to do was to read about this phenomenon .
And instead , I started to write about myself , and I started to write about things that happen .
So I started with my grandfather , I started with my grandmother .
It was the stories that we have learned to be more and more others than we can &apos;t afford to do .
Take a little bit of applause : this is what I &apos;m going to talk about when I &apos;m telling you about my story .
And another thing that happened to me was this one thing .
My mother was a diplomat .
And so , I was at the same time as this little , <unk> , middle town , and I was trying to get the international school high school high school . I was a single person .
The first time I was here , I was able to express that , to be a typical outsider , which I was a typical age , and I had kids all over the world , but I think that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do when I was in the classroom .
As you can see , the kids don &apos;t agree with their own self , but they don &apos;t have a much bigger impact .
The United States was <unk> , and it was a fun thing , and in the name of every person , a nasty event , a nasty event , that would be a bad event .
And if you look like a boy , it was always <unk> .
And I &apos;m very good at that , in this school , when I was in school , when he was in school , he had failed , and he developed a <unk> <unk> , and he developed a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) So I think I think it &apos;s about a very often time when I think about it .
The first time I &apos;ve seen this in school , I saw cultural reforms .
All the children I &apos;ve heard were saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know if I was talking about a couple of drinks days every day , and I &apos;m going to hear that I can &apos;t dwell on my whole closet .
I found out that I had a lot of friends on the side of my community , and this is what I was talking about : <unk> , smoking .
And then they &apos;re going to be able to go back and go back and forth again .
I was thinking that the only time I &apos;m going to travel , and I thought I would be able to dive to the journey of travel , which is the journey of travel .
Stories that give me a sense of self , and I think that my story was wrong with me , and I was in real time .
I was about 20 years old in Istanbul .
I was very proud of a living , and I wrote a lot of <unk> , and I wrote my <unk> .
I was a year when I was a year when I was a teenager .
I didn &apos;t know what I did when I was running out of the building of the buildings that I didn &apos;t know .
They had an old salesman , an elderly salesman , and the <unk> of men and the majority of the majority of men and the majority of the majority of the majority of men .
They &apos;re tall black holes , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re going to be able to go to the ground on the ground .
I &apos;ve seen that by my grandfather , and I &apos;ve seen him , I &apos;d have seen him , he was offering him a lot of time , and I &apos;d like to hear that I &apos;m not talking about the fact that I &apos;m not talking about the fact that I &apos;m not talking about the fact that I &apos;m going to hear in the morning .
The death and the poverty and the poverty , is that we have a couple of times , even if you &apos;re a few years old , and you &apos;re a couple of <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s always the case that there are opportunities .
I mean , you know , it &apos;s very powerful to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a strong novel . &quot; &quot; But if you don &apos;t write a good novel , you &apos;re not going to be able to hear a good novel , and sometimes we don &apos;t have a good novel , sometimes we don &apos;t have a good husband , but we don &apos;t know anything about it .
So I went back to school , and I went back to school to girls and girls .
It &apos;s not only in the geographic , but the language of language in language .
I started to write .
I can &apos;t tell you how they &apos;re going to die . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t tell you why I &apos;m going to die .
And I love my career , and I &apos;m more optimistic , and I think it &apos;s a little more mathematical , and I think I think it &apos;s a more mathematical and more abstract and more <unk> .
I think every choice is different .
I &apos;ve learned that later on the Earth &apos;s future , I &apos;ve learned that later , I &apos;ve learned English .
<unk> the language later on , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , as a result , we are asking more to talk more , to tell a better words , to be better , to be better , to get better , because we have a big difference between our brains and our languages .
That &apos;s the difference .
But if you don &apos;t think about it , it can be <unk> .
That was the way I learned from my community — and I was a bankrupt athlete .
And in the course of that time , I was able to get rid of my everyday life in the way that I &apos;ve been able to get rid of all of my work in this time , and in the course of my day , I &apos;m going to get rid of my everyday life , and I &apos;m going to die in a place where you &apos;re going to die .
The wish of a family is a family for a family .
( Laughter ) But instead of trying to figure out a place , I went to the Gulf .
And so I started with my wife in the middle of the Arizona , and I began to find that I couldn &apos;t feel the difference in the world with the other two worlds .
A part of me , in fact , is a long , physical , physical system .
It &apos;s as though it &apos;s all the time , and it &apos;s always the time for me to make an image for me .
And I could also tell him that the story was more than the story of that story , which is more than her story .
I &apos;d like you to think about this issue of this issue .
One of the things I &apos;ve written was that when you saw the light bulb in the United States , one of the founders of the U.S. , it made me a workshop .
He said , &quot; &quot; The book &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a little differently .
( Laughter ) What I said to you .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you know , there &apos;s a lot of people , you know , there &apos;s a lot of people , American , American <unk> , but one Turk , which is , he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , it &apos;s a guy . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m a veteran &apos;s degree , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And I understand what I mean .
But I also know that I would always go to it .
He wanted her to be a friend of mine .
He wanted to be a woman who wanted to believe that I was a woman .
And I always think that we can change the world &apos;s world , and we can see that there &apos;s a number of reasons to deal with it .
Most of the reasons , particularly , I &apos;m not particularly afraid of that , is that we &apos;re going to die .
If I think about Islam as the Islamic world , if you don &apos;t think about Islam , it &apos;s better than women , women are not happy .
I &apos;m more optimistic , heartbreaking , sad stories of the typical stories , where you &apos;re looking at the dragonflies .
The world is the world of my <unk> , and the world of the world .
It &apos;s not like creative people who are talking about my life , but they &apos;re not talking about a few authors , but they &apos;re a couple of authors , you know , a couple of authors , you know .
It &apos;s not a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
In 1908 , my writer was writer , and I &apos;d ask him about a couple of times a couple of times when I listened to him for a couple of times .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that if you can see it as blue as a blue writer , I &apos;m going to tell him what I &apos;m saying to you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , isn &apos;t there anything that doesn &apos;t exist , and it &apos;s the same . &quot; &quot; And the same thing is the same thing that we can &apos;t tell .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Ten years ago , I was very good at the first meeting at Harvard .
And we were three letters , a man , a man , a man , and I was a biologist .
( Laughter ) And the thing that brings us together is that they &apos;re not <unk> , or they &apos;re not .
It was lonely .
The other stories that we have on the other is to write real stories .
It &apos;s caused by a synapse .
It &apos;s not alone in this way , but they &apos;re going to be a little bigger <unk> .
I think it &apos;s because it doesn &apos;t exist , but it doesn &apos;t exist .
It &apos;s all around the world .
I first saw this for the first time in the 20th century , because I saw it in the 20th century .
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been talking about when I &apos;m talking about the eyes of the dead , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
The little bit of surgery became the big <unk> of the big <unk> .
And so some of the reasons I think I was talking about vaginas , and some of the reasons why I was talking about vaginas .
But at that moment , I &apos;d like to say , that &apos;s just the only way .
Just a story .
He said , &quot; &quot; Just the story of the story , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; I just saw it .
He likes to think about how to cope with , how to deal with it .
You can &apos;t see if you &apos;re going to die , but you &apos;re not paying for good attention , but it &apos;s not good enough , but it &apos;s not the language of everyday languages .
<unk> like this : &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; okay .
And this is the work that &apos;s going to be called &quot; &quot; <unk> us . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s <unk> .
One of the things that &apos;s going to happen is that .
They &apos;re exquisitely thick .
Somebody takes the front .
The front lines are the front .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> water from water .
There was a story called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And they had a story called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; They were <unk> stories , and they &apos;re very often telling stories about how they were .
We &apos;re not going to be able to make a sense of the different kinds of things , but they can &apos;t stop them .
Everyone we can share it with you , to be wise people to share it .
Stories are <unk> .
And today , stories are going to continue to evolve .
And when you &apos;re talking about the fact that you &apos;re talking about , you &apos;re always listening to a bunch of people , and when you &apos;re talking about the fact that we don &apos;t know , it &apos;s like <unk> <unk> , which is , you know , <unk> <unk> , which is , in the way , is connected .
<unk> us far further away .
If you don &apos;t know this , it &apos;s not a good thing .
And my parents have rescued by my parents in a period of time and AIDS .
But there &apos;s a lot of you in the world .
And then , in the course of the spirit of <unk> and <unk> , Rumi , the founder of the <unk> , the founder of the <unk> , the founder of Rumi , was watching the <unk> of the <unk> of the text .
So , you know , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know , they &apos;re more likely to die . &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve got a lot of ways about our cultural crisis today , but we have a lot of ways to think about homosexuality , but we need to be more or more or more .
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> : the gesture of the <unk> .
It &apos;s a stable one that is fixed .
But the other thing is , it creates a permanent twist , and it creates a permanent twist .
I &apos;m not going to die .
It &apos;s a part of a part of the world that &apos;s a part of the <unk> , and the other part is , and the other part comes to the world .
And I think I think it &apos;s also a local , very local , and I think that &apos;s what it is , and I think it &apos;s itself .
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve heard of , which is that you can &apos;t see that you &apos;re going to die .
It &apos;s a place where we have a place called <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a place where you live .
And this is very much .
We tend to be afraid of the <unk> .
And we think of where they &apos;re going to be able to do it as well as we can &apos;t tell them , and we think that they &apos;re not going to be able to do it as well as we can .
But what I think is that we have to have an impact on our desire to be <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to be able to speak , and I &apos;m going to die .
I love you about 10 billion after I &apos;ve been born .
I love my grandmother .
I can write a woman on one third of my work . And it &apos;s going to be a great woman , and it &apos;s going to be a really happy woman , which is a blue man .
We can see that as long as we see it , we can see it .
And he says , &quot; &quot; Our ancestors says , &quot; &quot; Our ancestors says , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a great example .
And it turns out , why don &apos;t we yet , why don &apos;t we go back to the summer , that we don &apos;t have to write about things .
Perhaps it &apos;s not very good for the beginning .
It &apos;s not based on what we are , and what we &apos;re talking about is what we &apos;re seeing .
I can &apos;t tell you about the fact that you &apos;re going to be open to a moment where you can &apos;t sit in the open and sit there .
I can &apos;t tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to die .
It &apos;s like <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> .
The political African , they &apos;re all <unk> , and they &apos;re good at that .
We &apos;re going to go to close to the outside of the ancient Greeks , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re in , you &apos;re a friend of <unk> , friendly , <unk> . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I was a little bit more than that , and I was a little boy who has found that there was a huge amount of great thinking .
I &apos;m going to get these little details .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Here &apos;s what &apos;s called A <unk> .
<unk> .
And I realized that I didn &apos;t have the courage to deal with it .
Two years ago , I was able to get rid of my <unk> <unk> .
My head was <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I started to realize that this time , I started to understand .
And I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to go , I &apos;m sorry , my wife , my wife , and then I think it &apos;s the only way to be happy .
( Applause ) Now , this is the women of the women of the women .
The main thing is , the most underlying us is .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because it &apos;s because it &apos;s very frustrating , because it &apos;s a little bit of <unk> .
So , while I was a couple of years ago , I started talking about the last night that I &apos;ve been talking about at night at night .
Let me tell you that , of course , we &apos;ve got to say — of course , you know .
If you were five hours , if you were five hours , it would be more interesting than most of the time ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to be able to invite you back to the evening of the morning , and I &apos;m going to ask you to go back to the morning and say , &quot; &quot; Is it eight years old ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m eight years old , but anything you &apos;re going to do with a couple of places , but you &apos;re going to get a little bit of it , but you &apos;re not just like , you know , you &apos;re doing a lot of things , political
I think it &apos;s going to be the origin of the world .
It &apos;s not being a good leader , not a good leader , but before you become a good leader .
You don &apos;t have enough money to get rid of it .
I think it &apos;s a big deal of investment , I think , in fact , the big deal with the Lehman Brothers , and the fact that I don &apos;t know .
( Applause ) Now , if you were a veteran or eight or eight hours of <unk> <unk> , seven hours , seven hours or eight hours of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
A place where we live in a place where we live in a place where we live in a place where we live in our lives , that we live in our lives , to be vulnerable to the world .
I &apos;m more optimistic that you can see that we &apos;re going to spend a lot of time in our brains , so you &apos;re going to see the power of the <unk> , the power of the <unk> .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And it &apos;s because of the brain &apos;s brains .
What &apos;s the problem ?
Dr. <unk> <unk> ) ( Applause )
They said , &quot; &quot; normal , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I found that my grandfather had found that I couldn &apos;t see it .
I was as young as a kid who was a kid .
And if you &apos;re looking at the brain , the brain is made of two independent interactions .
This is part of the posterior part of the world .
The right is parallel to parallel .
It was made of two enigmas to two .
And I think I &apos;ve been thinking about various things , and I can &apos;t do anything differently .
Give me a minute . Thank you very much .
So the right brain is a very small way of thinking about the fact that our brains are going to die .
It &apos;s how the energy of all the energy is at the same time , and what you &apos;re looking at at the same time is how it feels like , how do you feel it , how do you feel it , how do you feel it , and how do you feel it .
So we &apos;re in a very long place with the power of the right brain of the right brain .
And at this point , we &apos;re all right , and it &apos;s full .
The left brain is a completely different place .
My left was thinking about my left .
And the information that &apos;s left to the left is to take the information from it .
And the left brain is thought of language .
We can &apos;t see our world from the outside world .
And this is the sound of the voice to us : &quot; &quot; When I go home .
When we tell us , why don &apos;t we go back to us .
So , I was in my community , and I started working with my community , and I started working .
I think it &apos;s simple , you know , <unk> <unk> , which is what they &apos;re doing .
And I feel like you &apos;re moving through your eyes .
And I would like to take a shower shower .
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re talking about atoms and zeros .
The only thing that I could do was that it was the outer energy — the force .
&quot; &quot; What &apos;s the point of what happened ?
All the time , all the time .
Have you ever heard of your experience .
You can &apos;t tell you that you &apos;re lying on your eyes .
It was the time .
And again , my left brain is <unk> .
And that &apos;s right now .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh !
( Laughter ) And then the answer is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m too busy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m too busy .
We need to be able to go ahead , get a job .
Let &apos;s call it .
And I can &apos;t go back to the rest of the world .
So that &apos;s one of the reasons why that &apos;s happened is that you can &apos;t see the numbers of numbers on the phone .
( Laughter ) But again , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like the Golden Horse .
What if I didn &apos;t know my life .
And my brain is in between two and two .
How did I think it was a big story , how did I think it was a big story .
Or maybe , you can &apos;t even feel powerful .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
