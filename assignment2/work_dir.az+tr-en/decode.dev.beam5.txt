I was 11 years old , and in one of the cases , I was 11 years old .
My father was a little dancer in the BBC morning .
We had a suspicion that we didn &apos;t have any doubts that we didn &apos;t have anything , because it doesn &apos;t fit in your mind .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban will come back ! &quot; &quot; — my father &apos;s father .
I didn &apos;t realize what this meant , but I knew how it was happy .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go to school . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll go to school .
Nobody had ever met .
It &apos;s going to go to school .
I had only six years to get the Taliban from the Taliban to girls .
So for five years , the next five years , I &apos;ve been able to go out and go out and dig wells to be a boy , as a boy for five years .
That &apos;s the only way to get education to education .
Every day , I &apos;ve been able to go through a different way , which nobody can do .
I &apos;m going to say that the market is going to be a marketplace , just because it doesn &apos;t matter .
In the middle of the school , you &apos;re in the middle of the school , and you &apos;re in the middle of a little bit like a little bit .
He was comfortable at the time , but he would have been so hot .
We knew that we would all know that we were going to die .
And sometimes , for the Taliban , for the Taliban , they &apos;re not going to be killed .
And I always think that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at .
What if ?
Where do we live ?
And yet , there was a place where we wanted high school .
I was actually a very lucky person , and I &apos;m a very lucky person to do anything I &apos;m talking about .
My father was a man who was a human being .
He had a different kind of insight from a life that lives in a very different way , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he insisted , &quot; &quot; he insisted , &quot; &quot; and it was <unk> by his father , and it was <unk> by his father .
But my mother had to teach me .
<unk> .
Two years ago , I went back to me and went to a school for girls and girls and girls .
And my father — this was the first time that was the first time in prison .
And it &apos;s not that he had no doubts that he didn &apos;t have to go to education , and he didn &apos;t have any money .
For her , it was more than a prison attorney than he was educated .
It would be the Taliban , it would come out , it would be in time , in the course of the rest of the 20th century , and in fact , it &apos;s always a flash of light .
So I &apos;m going to die . My father , and my father , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , you can &apos;t read anything .
It can be <unk> . You can put your house into the middle of the war .
But it &apos;s the only thing that we &apos;re always worried about , and if you &apos;re not going to go through the school , and if you don &apos;t like that , you &apos;re going to get to school , you &apos;re going to get to school .
Now , if you don &apos;t go on the road ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s 22 <unk> .
I grew up in a country in a country where I grew up in a country .
I &apos;m going to spend a quarter of six percent of the middle schools , and if you don &apos;t think about it , and if you don &apos;t think about it , I &apos;m not going to be able to do that .
<unk> , I , here , I was here , is that you can &apos;t see that you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) One of the guys who was first invited me to school was one of my first son , was my father , my father was my father .
It &apos;s not just because I &apos;m the first woman , but I was a young woman in Kabul , and I was the first woman in Kabul .
( Applause ) He &apos;s convinced me .
We have the Great Depression , which is bigger than me .
And so , to that point , it was a global revolution in which women called the education of women .
This is why , in a country where women are still in the school , there was a country in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , for the first boarding .
And the most important thing is that I see students who are going to be able to do this , and I see the lessons that we &apos;re going to do in our brains .
And I see what they &apos;re saying to me about their ancestors , their ancestors , to me , to me , to tell us how to fight , despite all of the opposition .
You know , you can &apos;t see it . You can &apos;t see it , and I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s real .
A month ago , when he was meeting with his wife , he had to put them on the runway , and he tore them down a few minutes of waiting for a few minutes .
The phone rang and his phone rings , and the voice is , if you &apos;re going to continue to school , you &apos;re going to be able to go back to school .
And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to die anymore . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , &quot; &quot; but I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m not <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the thing I &apos;ve discovered about time was that , sometimes , I &apos;ve discovered that every one of us had been ignored by the fact that they ignore them , that they &apos;re not going to be ignored by the fact that they &apos;ve never ignored
That &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with our brains , that we don &apos;t have an oasis .
In fact , our ancestors are brilliant , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re like , you know , they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , I &apos;m a doctor .
There are hundreds of girls who are going to go to school for the Taliban , like the number of girls — that are , like , <unk> .
And what we &apos;re looking at in Afghanistan is more than three million girls .
( Applause ) It &apos;s very different from the United States of America .
The Americans don &apos;t know if the Americans don &apos;t know .
The US military , after the National army , they were able to get a lot of <unk> .
But when I was in college , and when I was in school , and when we were able to get them , we can see them , and when we see them , it &apos;s an increase in which you can get a certificate , and that &apos;s the increase .
And for me , I &apos;m going to die , and I &apos;m going to die from my childhood , and the girls who were talking about the girls and the girls are more than one day .
And they &apos;re a big fan of me as I am .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
They &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re <unk> . &quot; &quot; And everybody who has these cute jobs that have been so cute is that you go down for two half hours , if you go down for two half hours , you &apos;re going to go down for about two half hours , and if you go down for the two half hours , you &apos;re going to go down for about two half hours , and if you go down for the two half hours , you &apos;re going to go down for about two half
And you see here , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you know , for the art of my house , it &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
This is glowing <unk> , wet , <unk> .
And this is cute .

It &apos;s every one of the time , every one of them .
This is the invisible world . And that &apos;s what happened today .
underwater diving , underwater <unk> ...
It &apos;s a place where you can &apos;t find a place in the courtyard and in the background .
The females see that the female &apos;s only more likely to get more than one more than that .
Let &apos;s go back one time . Watch on the right , the net on the right .
Let &apos;s step back and get a step back .
<unk> . I love <unk> . This is a giant <unk> .
Watch them . You get them inside , and they get inside . They &apos;re <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> .
This is the rock game . It &apos;s a lot of new things , a lot of new things .
And they &apos;re a nightmare . Isn &apos;t that incredible ?
And he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , it was viewed .
So the best thing to go is to be a big deal .
It &apos;s coming back .
One . Three . Three .
<unk> , who &apos;s been told , who &apos;s been the 25th anniversary of the world .
Everything I can do is to change our lives .
And when we see the first public , we can see that we can see the first public crisis .
And I didn &apos;t know if I was born .
And now , you know , I &apos;m going to die at the moment .
And so , you can &apos;t see that there &apos;s a lot of people in the country , and you can &apos;t see the China in China .
It &apos;s a part of the puzzle .
( Applause )
I can &apos;t go back to the Supreme Court .
And I think it &apos;s for me to be afraid .
Every single thing I &apos;ve been talking about is that you can &apos;t talk about anything .
And you can answer questions and answer questions .
He &apos;s a police worker .
But most of the people in the U.S.
And while I was lucky , I was very lucky , and I was so lucky , I was so lucky .
A new language , after business , would have been a new language , and then the whole thing would have been a <unk> .
In southern South Asia , we <unk> the <unk> .
We all know that we &apos;re going to live in a 67 years , and they &apos;re going to get 67 years .
Will the South Asia or the North ?
So I started to ask how to save them .
I was trying to go back to the North Pole .
To deal with the poor in China .
I can &apos;t stand up and stand up .
<unk> <unk> .
But for short years , I &apos;m going to die .
They &apos;re very repetitive , but they &apos;re going to be <unk> in southern South Asia .
I never knew someone I didn &apos;t know .
And I did what I did to do , and I &apos;m not going to be able to see the next clip , and I &apos;m going to spend the next time trying to figure out what I &apos;m going to do .
So I was in the village of my life .
They &apos;re very little , and they &apos;re <unk> .
I can &apos;t believe that the TED <unk> de Saint-Exupery .
This is in 1908 , in 1908 .
We &apos;re going to be able to get rid of it .
The building is going to go through the building of the building .
Now , you know , children are very proud of the story .
It looks like the building blocks .
Why is it that ?
He said to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if you want to have your family .
And I said to him , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; But he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , how do you get a lot of your work ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , the public must be absolute .
So we &apos;ve done that in the course of the time , but I &apos;ve been working on the street .
There are three gaps in the building .
And they let you go away from the memorial .
But okay , they &apos;re using other words .
They &apos;re going to get to you .
Kids don &apos;t know .
( Laughter ) Sometimes I &apos;m going to get close to the tree of a tree .
This boy you see this boy who loves the tree , so he loves him .
( Laughter ) Every single thing is <unk> , they &apos;re going to sit beyond the date .
This is very cute .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We &apos;ve done it as possible , because we want to see the kids don &apos;t just stand up , but we want to see it .
The door is very high , but it happens to see the ceiling .
And this is where it &apos;s happening — there &apos;s a lot of water in the water .
You see , you can see that you &apos;re going to lose your bag of agile pipes , you can &apos;t see it , you can &apos;t see it .
But you can see that the boy doesn &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to get rid of them with water .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a completely flat time in the morning of the year .
We don &apos;t have any doubts , and we don &apos;t have anything .
And that means that , in fact , it &apos;s made up of space .
We don &apos;t have to be there .
It doesn &apos;t exist .
Most of those kids don &apos;t think they &apos;re going to die .
But there &apos;s no reason why we don &apos;t have anything .
Because there is no excuse here .
He says , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re afraid , if you want to be in the room , boy will be in the room .
<unk> <unk> , where you can go and go back .
( Laughter ) I mean , you know , kids don &apos;t like it .
And here they go back and forth again .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
And the second is that we think it &apos;s very important to be a <unk> .
You know , kids don &apos;t get better .
And there &apos;s a place where you can see .
The kids are high at the top of the class .
You know , I &apos;m not going to be able to get rid of you .
They have to sound .
And you know , you know , you &apos;re not going to be in the middle of the closet .
They should be able to have fun .
You know , this is what it means to do .
This is okay .
You know , you can see that we can get a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to get rid of our cities .
We &apos;re going to get 50 degrees of <unk> .
Water larvae .
They &apos;re <unk> .
So they &apos;re not going to be able to get it .
And we &apos;re looking at these kinds of things .
And they work in the boonies .
It &apos;s actually helping us to help .
They &apos;re not .
( Laughter ) This is a child that &apos;s going to be a kid .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at .
This is what it is .
Here &apos;s good .
We have a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s working with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) They &apos;re more . ( Laughter )
In every classroom , we have a nightmare , no , no .
<unk> in Santa Claus comes out of this .
And this is , in fact , it was built on a straight line , where he was building a straight line .
We have five meters long , and they &apos;re seven meters .
I was very proud of the fact that we had a lot of fun .
The idea is the idea .
We don &apos;t let a girl before a girl .
They work .
They &apos;re not getting a lot of them .
They &apos;re wrong , but they &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> . It &apos;s my grandmother .
( Laughter ) So that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to look at it .
Then you have the other kids .
You know , it &apos;s very <unk> .
( Laughter ) It tries to learn how to judge the driver .
It needs to be a little bit more likely to be a <unk> .
They &apos;re not going to be able to make a lot of help .
This is a <unk> , and we can &apos;t help these kinds of opportunities .
This is a <unk> , a long boy , a long boy , a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not very little .
So this little morning , this little morning is about 600 meters .
But it &apos;s still wrong .
These kids are now moving 4,000 meters in the middle of a day .
The kids are the highest athletic qualities in between the kids .
He &apos;s always saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can &apos;t get them off .
They &apos;re going to hit you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They &apos;re not going to go . ( Laughter )
I think that &apos;s what I think we have to do , and we have no protection , but they &apos;re <unk> .
You can &apos;t see it .
Because it &apos;s because of how we live .
And I think that the world is changing the world and the people in the world .
This building is one of the things that came to change lives .
Thank you .

In the 1970s , China was <unk> in the 1970s two years .
I took my first grade trip to the public class , and I took my bike up to the public .
But the lion said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I was afraid of an engineer , as they were .
And then he was a <unk> , and he was a <unk> , and he was the only way that they &apos;re going to get warm and warm .
My job doesn &apos;t matter .
But my wish for my wish was to be the Chinese opera .
This is what we &apos;re going to do in the process .
I have to be talking about the young ages of the opera , to be a teenager , and I did not know that I had to go to the opera .
And I wrote a letter to me as well as a high school in the middle of the school .
But I think that &apos;s my mind .
Nobody believed I &apos;m serious .
But my friends would have been telling me that I had kids like me .
So I realized that I was late at 15 years old .
I didn &apos;t have any money .
The second class you can &apos;t afford to get in the second class is that it &apos;s not the only <unk> .
But it was a <unk> .
Another way we can figure out how to explore .
Nobody &apos;s going to see me on the road ? No .
I &apos;ve spent my family reading .
I &apos;ve been doing this book by <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;ve been doing this book by <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; &#93; And I took a hundred pounds of Tylenol , and I took a model of the women &apos;s license . &quot; &quot; &#93; So I took a model of that , and I &apos;ve found this woman , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — this woman , I found this guy &apos;s model .
&#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) &#91; another &#93; &#91; Another &#93; called the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
And of course , I was able to take care of my ancestors .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> meen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> .
There &apos;s no use of all the benefits to be solved .
It &apos;s interesting , it &apos;s a little bit odd .
( Laughter ) This is a second of the other day .
But the fifth of me brought me up to me . He said , &quot; &quot; Dad , you don &apos;t agree .
They said , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is different and more <unk> . &quot; &quot; And this way , I &apos;m going to give you a chance that I can &apos;t believe in the fact that I &apos;m going to get the opportunity to come back in the morning .
He also gave me the opportunity to compare it to the novel .
And this can &apos;t happen to you .
For example , the first time this map seemed odd to me , because it &apos;s a little bit odd to me that we can &apos;t tell .
Have you ever been told that China is not supposed to be in the middle of the world .
In fact , the map shows the map of the map .
It &apos;s not a new thing that &apos;s not a new thing .
This is a standard <unk> world world .
In fact , there &apos;s also the science of science , and there &apos;s also the science of science , like religion .
<unk> and <unk> are helping us with their lives .
And so I &apos;m going to tell you that we &apos;re going to work for the study of exploration , and why we live in everyday life ?
So I started to read my <unk> at the beginning .
And he said , &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> meen , &quot; &quot; writer <unk> : <unk> <unk> , Warren Buffett and <unk> , &quot; &quot; Alice in Alice &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause )
For Jesus , it was economic and political and political .
I &apos;m interested in what I &apos;m interested in : these were all sorts of things : <unk> , <unk> and social .
I &apos;m also interested in being read about two languages in the language of <unk> .
&#91; &quot; &quot; The <unk> Trail . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) I found that I had found that there was an interesting reaction .
For example , I realized that the word &quot; &quot; Aliens &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; in Arabic , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; Aliens &quot; &quot; in China .
In China , the word &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; Yes !
( Laughter ) My journey is my view , and my mind is , with people who are connected to people with people .
I could never look at it . I can &apos;t even see it .
<unk> from the other people who were able to die from other people .
And we started to explore that , that desire is not the only purpose of desire .
The key to the point is that we are connected to the point where you can relate to the point of view and the point of view .
And the desire to do it is to do that .
It &apos;s because I &apos;m going to die , and I &apos;m going to die , and I &apos;m very , very time-consuming .
Let me tell you , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t agree !
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
If you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to be able to see if you &apos;re going to die , and if you &apos;re down there , you &apos;re not going to be able to see that you &apos;re going to die at the bottom of your day .
It just goes back .
It &apos;s about the information that &apos;s going on .
To work today .
You can &apos;t read it . What is it happening .
So I &apos;m going to spend a lot of time in my life , and I said , &quot; &quot; Why am I ? &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to go back to the night room , and you &apos;re going to see the next night that you &apos;re going to see , and then you &apos;re going to see that you &apos;re going to see your own vulnerability .
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s like , you know , you &apos;re going to get to this meeting .
And I think that if you don &apos;t know how good at stake , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t know how good I &apos;m going to do , I &apos;m going to be able to go back . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m going to get the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But every day , if you don &apos;t know how good people are .
And I &apos;m going to get something much more valuable than the office agency .
<unk> , you know .
In fact , I think it &apos;s the reason that it &apos;s been a terrible disease , which is why I think it &apos;s a new disease , and it &apos;s not going to go through it .
( Laughter ) The main thing is to say that the main imperative is to the extent that we &apos;re going to lose the word &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) No .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> — his nose , click , <unk> — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — that &apos;s important , isn &apos;t it ?

And if you &apos;re going to get a lot away in the road , you &apos;ll actually get the results .
But in the last few years , we &apos;ve been able to participate in a wide variety of years .
<unk> . ( Laughter ) And the reason why this is the good reason is that this guy doesn &apos;t know if you &apos;re good at this guy , it &apos;s not a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
Well , there &apos;s been a <unk> of global warming .
I think it &apos;s about education .

This is about five <unk> video that I hate to do with the video that I hate to speak about .
We &apos;re going to get rid of the power to control the car .

And they were looking at everybody &apos;s <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> .

There &apos;s been 500,000 countries a couple of years later that we &apos;ve been able to do this with a couple of countries , in fact , 500,000 countries , a lot of countries , in this video .
And three years later , this video takes your perspective every month .
And if you &apos;re in this picture , the picture of the picture and the video is by <unk> .
And I was trying to figure out what I &apos;d like to do with my grandfather .
I can &apos;t use it to be useful and use it .
So I started with a workshop , and I started talking about the fact that there was a lot of people , and you know what they &apos;re going to do with you .
In the middle of the middle of the middle , the middle class is bright , and that &apos;s what happens to be bright .

In the first time , the first time I first started .
And even if you don &apos;t know , if you lose a person , you don &apos;t hear if you lose a human suffering .
One of the simplest is one of the simplest ones .
So , you know , I &apos;m not going to be able to change my life .
The last night I &apos;m going to die in the last night .
We need to recognize that the people who can &apos;t believe that we can &apos;t believe in the world .
We &apos;re going to be able to measure that , or we &apos;re going to be able to measure it , to be able to measure what they &apos;re supposed to be .
&quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot;
Before I went down , he was going to be able to deal with me .
And this is a scientific work that has led to <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s what we call &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and it makes people more likely to get better people .
It can be changed .

The human race is higher than human beings .
And if you don &apos;t have a lot of calories , you &apos;re going to lose a lot of food , you know , you &apos;re going to lose a lot of calories , you know , if you don &apos;t have a lot of calories , or if you don &apos;t have a lot of calories , you &apos;re going to get a lot of <unk> , or you &apos;re going to get a lot of time in your life .
I &apos;m not going to die . He &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
So we &apos;re not going to be able to share the claims , the curiosity , the curiosity , the curiosity , the curiosity , the curiosity , and the science of science , the science of science , the science , the theoretical science , the horrible science , and it &apos;s meaningless .
<unk> in the last time , I &apos;d like you to go back and get bored .
Some of them tend to believe that they can &apos;t tell us .
But let &apos;s say , well , there &apos;s a lot of things .
In the police of the police lobby , we were able to get rid of them , and we can &apos;t tell them that if they don &apos;t get sick , they &apos;re going to die . ( Laughter ) We want to change the idea of good ideas .
I &apos;m going to show you a little bit of nasty .
And I think that &apos;s how we can do this . NBC , for the producers .
<unk> <unk> .
His name is called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot;
( Laughter ) We &apos;re going to spend about 900 billion dollars .
<unk> <unk> is a plastic thing that &apos;s plastic in your pocket .
<unk> are used to use a lot of things to do , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about in the student .
( Laughter ) So , this works like this : When I was thinking about it , I &apos;m going to be able to go back to the side of the crowd , and I &apos;m going to die .
It &apos;s something like this .
I &apos;m going to show you .
( Laughter ) <unk> . This is a little bit <unk> .
And yet , we &apos;ve been able to experiment with the experiment of science .
And it turns out that this is going to slow down .
( Laughter ) ( Music ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) No , no .
Of course , this is the question of the question , which is : Does it happen to you ?
And the answer is that , yes , you get rid of your <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s not just a lone nut , but it &apos;s also <unk> .
And so , you &apos;ve got to see a brief number of reasons , which is that , you know , it &apos;s like , <unk> and <unk> .
People are <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re doing everything in our brains , and we &apos;re able to do anything about it .
So we did .
We took two seconds , and we took the answer to the number of letters that I &apos;d never seen before , and that was a blank slate .
And I &apos;ve been a successful 50 percent . ( Laughter ) And the fact that I didn &apos;t think about it , is that we &apos;re going to die .
This was an interesting example of what we &apos;re doing , and this is a little example .
It &apos;s a &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in three months .
This is the future of <unk> <unk> .
Are people going to die ?
So I have some idea of this stuff . This is what you &apos;re talking about , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at .
In every decade , average IQ increases three number three .
Very interesting .
And I think it &apos;s like a scientific currency , or a scientific currency .
<unk> and religion ?
This is like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
These are two things .
It &apos;s not <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
We can &apos;t think about the well-being of our lives .
It &apos;s the way that you can &apos;t speak to all of us .
What if you could ask , &quot; &quot; What are you going to do ? &quot; &quot; And if you don &apos;t know what ?
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is one of the &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; ?
The question is , if you don &apos;t think about it , it &apos;s more real .
And we have to be aware of the world before , before you know , that &apos;s not the world .
Is it more real ? Is it going to be more real ?
( Laughter ) So things like this , when things like Sydney , you &apos;re going to get into your head .
<unk> for you , &quot; &quot; It gives you a great deal .
I think you &apos;re going to hear the second story , which is , &quot; &quot; This is all intelligent design <unk> .
That &apos;s what this <unk> looks like .
( Applause ) You can say , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t hear anything . &quot; &quot; But that doesn &apos;t prove anything .
It doesn &apos;t have the same thing .
That &apos;s because of the work of design , for the moment .
You can tell the story , the scientists sometimes tend to look at the dark energy , the dark energy , the dark matter , the dark matter .
This is what you &apos;re doing for science .
And this is what we &apos;re going to do with the design of design for a while .
( Applause ) But the same is the same question .
Have you ever been able to get rid of your lives , or if you don &apos;t know ?
This is what I &apos;m going to call my <unk> <unk> in the middle of the morning .
It &apos;s just like if you don &apos;t have the <unk> ? &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s like , you know .
Have you ever said , &quot; &quot; Nano . &quot; &quot; It doesn &apos;t have to go .
This is a picture of &quot; &quot; Kodak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> .
Somebody &apos;s going to be ready to get outside .
The camera was ready — it &apos;s like this .
( Laughter ) And you can think about most of these things , or even if you &apos;re in the room , you might think it &apos;s real . &quot; &quot; But you know , it &apos;s all too big .
The more trust we &apos;ve ever had , the more trust you can have , is that they &apos;re always going to die .
For example , there were two problems that were <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The first is that there was no reason that he had not had to die .
The second one was <unk> and <unk> , and that &apos;s because it doesn &apos;t understand what it &apos;s going to happen to our patients .
And he wrote this sort of article : &quot; I &apos;ve found that the first generation of the planet is in three seconds . &quot;
This is why we don &apos;t think about it .
So if you don &apos;t have a good career , you &apos;ll never be able to go to a good restaurant with your neighbors .
This is what we call <unk> .
This is a book in which we can &apos;t deal with the <unk> of the <unk> who &apos;s trying to deal with the <unk> .
These two things were known to be known . We had a good fortune to talk about the solar system and the solar system , and there was a very good thing to do with Kepler , and so that &apos;s because the Kepler lights are going faster than that .
And we knew that this telescope would also be <unk> .
And this is the result of the <unk> .
The sad thing is , it seems to be full of science fiction .
It &apos;s one of the reasons that we can &apos;t read , but it &apos;s just a realization that it &apos;s only an opportunity .
We &apos;ve done it all around the trunk .
This is <unk> <unk> .
In 1908 , the same thing that I was in 1908 would have thought that there was no way that people were born with this .
So here &apos;s a picture in 1908 .
You can &apos;t go through your chest , and you can do it again .
<unk> <unk> , you know , <unk> <unk> , which is , you know , <unk> <unk> .
And if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to die , you &apos;re going to die , because of course , you &apos;re going to die of it .
It &apos;s important to us , social , social .
And of course , you can &apos;t see it . You can &apos;t see all sorts of things .
And you see here , you see <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) And if you were <unk> , it would be <unk> .
<unk> . Did you see the <unk> <unk> ?
Or if you had an elephant .
Religious <unk> .
( Laughter ) In 1908 , it was <unk> <unk> .
He took five dollars to travel to the airport , and it took five dollars to the site , until he was able to get to the point where it was going to be <unk> .
So here &apos;s my nose , and I &apos;m going to die , you know .
We &apos;ve got to work very well on this , because they &apos;ve got a lot of fun , because they &apos;ve got these pictures , you know , they &apos;ve got these pictures , and they &apos;re looking at these pictures — people are looking at images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You can &apos;t see that there &apos;s not going to disappear in your head . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d like to say that I &apos;m going to die . Yeah , I &apos;ll go up here .
( Laughter ) You &apos;ve been 28 500 dollars to do this <unk> . ( Laughter )
Why don &apos;t you think about it now ? ( Laughter ) What if you don &apos;t know ? ( Laughter )
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to see this , I can &apos;t see this .
There was a human population .
And with the car , I &apos;d like to be a pretty nervous person with the car .
We &apos;re closer to look at it .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die , and I &apos;m going to get some great Randi , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two .
The qualities of the qualities are literally <unk> for thousands .
They &apos;re going to go to the back of the time , and they &apos;re going to get away from the backdrop .
This is a picture of a picture where you are <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And this is the image of another <unk> version of the other .
In every time , most of the most is the most wonderful .
( Laughter ) This is a really <unk> <unk> , or <unk> ? ( Laughter )
This is a similar example of this , which is that you can &apos;t do anything with it .
There &apos;s a film called the &quot; &quot; Web , &quot; &quot; which is a movie called &quot; &quot; the Web , &quot; &quot; where it needs to be shared .
And the way I &apos;m going to talk to you is , I &apos;m actually going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m going to die .
It &apos;s visible to everybody , everyone knows .
The hard answer is the answer .
( Laughter ) This is <unk> , the <unk> of these messages , these messages .
This is a <unk> called <unk> .
This is the greatest .
This is the name of this quote .
( Laughter ) If you have your <unk> , you have to be troubled .
May the summer of winter .
And yet , if you &apos;re two years old , you &apos;ll have to be able to go through the road .
You can go all the day .
Now , I &apos;m going to die . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
( Music ) &#91; <unk> &#93;
( Music ) What are the <unk> ? <unk> : Devil !
Devil ? The little bit of the end ?
Now , you know , you &apos;re going to see what your brain &apos;s going on , and I &apos;m going to die .
( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ends ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ends ) Now , when you see what you see , it &apos;s <unk> . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s a little tiny , cute and <unk> story .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
They were able to change the way that people would use their lives .
We have a pop <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
We have a lot of fun .
He was in 1908 . It was called &quot; &quot; <unk> million <unk> . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> million <unk> . &quot; &quot; The love of love — it &apos;s a <unk> , you know , a million years ago , if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
There &apos;s a section here .
( Music ) It &apos;s 12 billion light years . This is , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know who it is right , and you don &apos;t know who is right , but I can tell you that it &apos;s right .
Announcer : Yeah . I &apos;m at least close to close .
In America , this would be called &quot; &quot; <unk> light Years . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) My friend Simon was , <unk> <unk> , and the concept of &quot; &quot; The Great Divide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Great Depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Great Depression of the Great . &quot; &quot; OK .
So , for this , &quot; &quot; The Guardian &quot; &quot; wrote a paper about &quot; &quot; The Guardian , &quot; &quot; where we can see that we can &apos;t see how much we &apos;re <unk> .
They &apos;re not 12 years of light , and it &apos;s not <unk> .
And yet , you know , the downside is that it &apos;s very likely to be a very small number of things .
So , if it doesn &apos;t really matter , we can tell you that it &apos;s very close to the right .
And he was saying that he was going to write the script after the writing , and I &apos;d like to tell him that I was so shy , so I was so shy , I was so shy , I was amazed that I couldn &apos;t hear it .
And I was in my kitchen , and he wrote a story .
And I can &apos;t tell you about it .
( Music ) The idea is that it &apos;s going to be able to travel billion light years into the process of programmable dimensions .
It can be <unk> , but this is , you know , the top quartile .
And the way we get to the point of view is that we &apos;ve always been able to engage with our partners .
( Laughter ) Right ?
( Applause )
In the 1960s , if you have the writing of <unk> <unk> , you were <unk> him .
It was a <unk> that was written in a book called <unk> .
It knew the whole story of the government of the government .
I can &apos;t put a sheet of paper from a paper that comes out of a piece of paper , and that &apos;s what you find .
And we had a rug with a rug , and we found that as a great <unk> .
We never let it change our way .
But this morning , in 1908 , every one of you in the 20th century , you know , you &apos;re going to create a number of you , you know , one of them who belongs to your site , which is the only one that belongs to your neighbor , and in fact , in fact , the yellow cloud of the yellow dots are automatically <unk> in the foreground .
This is <unk> <unk> .
Nobody &apos;s going to get rid of it .
This is a <unk> technology that &apos;s used by technology that &apos;s used by technology .
This problem is three key online online .
And if we look at this , we see that we can see that there &apos;s some of the rules online , and we see it online .
This is three main principles of three main principles .
First , online , online .
This is like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s not very hard to understand what I &apos;m going to talk to you about the future .
These guys can get money .
And so many of them have been around online and they get a lot of money online .
In fact , I &apos;m going to write a millionaire from the online , which is the gift of the online .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is Alfred <unk> .
This is a test .
This is <unk> <unk> .
This is Matthew Anderson , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
These guys are <unk> online , but they &apos;re using things like this , and they &apos;re using things like this , and they &apos;re using things like this , and they &apos;re using things like this , or they &apos;re going to use it , or you &apos;re going to run a log bag online , when you &apos;re going to play your shirt , while you &apos;re going to get your work out of your kitchen .
Two months ago by the US , the National <unk> of America , with the National <unk> of America , was <unk> by the fact that he had to read , and he had a million U.S. <unk> <unk> .
Nobody knows where the Sam <unk> is .
I think it &apos;s bigger than the real world that I &apos;m talking about online , and I think it &apos;s bigger than the real world .
And it turns out that the answer is even more than the answer .
<unk> , the <unk> online online .
The second large part of the 20th century is not the cause of the cause .
As you get to see them , the idea is to be transported to the ground , the idea that you can &apos;t think about .
And as Anonymous as Anonymous is in the last year , I &apos;ve come up with the main place online , and the main place online .
We &apos;ve solved the two key examples : this is what they &apos;re doing to do this , and the third key is that they &apos;re like Anonymous , and the third key power is , the third key , the public and the government .
Let &apos;s take a look at the intersection of what &apos;s happened .
It was obvious that it was obvious , while he was paying attention to her , she was paying attention .
<unk> <unk> <unk> — which was more — it was .
Last year , I was working on my website , <unk> <unk> .
Somebody &apos;s going to get the whole system into the world .
And last week , I was asked to ask this story about the government of the government , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to ask myself this question , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you know that I was a man who was afraid of myself .
He said .
How is it that people would die like this ?
<unk> online online .
The lines are like <unk> .
What do you do ?
And if you want to think about the status quo , and if you want to use it , you have to use this <unk> to be used as well as it is .
We &apos;re using the tools that we can use or not , but that &apos;s more than the country that we call <unk> , but like this , we are more likely to use more than more than ever in the country , because they &apos;re more likely to use more than foreign governments in this country .
But it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s not the service of the outside .
It &apos;s possible that you can &apos;t believe in your genome .
This is what it happened to be a <unk> .
It &apos;s like the Arab Spring and the head of the Arab world ?
<unk> , 2011 , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Between this <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which was &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And there was a bunch of inmates on the top of this meeting , and there was a little bit of <unk> <unk> in the process , and the whole network of communication , to enable all of them to be under control of control .
This is what &apos;s going on in the course of the field that we &apos;ve been able to do in order to change the establishment .
We &apos;re going to be able to stand right here .
<unk> in the West , the Western tradition of the Western world , is a tool that will help us under the control of the West .
But the Western Treasury is the way they do it .
For example , a couple of weeks ago , I was a <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which was three weeks ago , with three German fighters that were created by German <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is your phone .
Now , you can &apos;t see it .
It will follow the Internet .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , who knows that you can &apos;t use all your voice online , knows , listen to your friends .
There &apos;s a lot of people talking about this , and the very few guys , the question is , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s not a good thing to tell me , it &apos;s not a lot of effect .
Why should I be wrong ?
We don &apos;t have anything secret . &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s very frustrating .
<unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> .
It &apos;s not based on the safety of security and recognition .
It &apos;s dependent on the relationship between this <unk> and control .
And we believe that in the summer of the year , we believe that in this case , that we believe that we can &apos;t even find that , in fact , that we can &apos;t even write .
But if you were in the middle of the last 50 years , if you &apos;re going to get the middle of the last 50 years ?
And this is the problem , and the question is , in 50 years , we have to be satisfied .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
And I say , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; Because I was 17 years old .
And this was the first <unk> in Washington , D.C.
My friends and my friends have been there for me to be afraid .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be here . &quot; &quot; My mother said , &quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; my mother , &quot; &quot; he said .
( Laughter ) Imagine the behavior of 17 , 17 years , and imagine the behavior of this kind of insanity ?
My father said to me , &quot; &quot; This is &quot; &quot; — this is <unk> .
And I didn &apos;t know that , because I knew he came out , and I didn &apos;t know what he came out of .
17 years later , I said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , who &apos;s my <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; God , what are you doing ?
And then I realized that this is my <unk> and <unk> .
My father said , &quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to take the word &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; which I would like to take away from you .
And yet , this is , despite the fact that this is our journey , it &apos;s all about us .
I &apos;d like to think that I think I should be optimistic , and I &apos;m going to tell you about my story about my life .
I &apos;m going to die in the last year of my life , the <unk> of the Golden Gate , the <unk> of the Golden Gate , the time I &apos;m going to die at that time , when I was at the time , when I was at the end of the morning .
I decided that I could use my <unk> to use my <unk> <unk> .
This is a big thing for California .
It &apos;s a big thing to do with the little bit of my life that I &apos;ve been living in , but it was a big thing to do with the fact that I live in June of 2001 , where there &apos;s 350 people here .
And so I started to dig up with my colleagues , and I started talking about what happened to me .
They said to me , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , you &apos;re doing that for us , right ?
And so , I was able to do that , and I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do this for bad luck , &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; people who don &apos;t know me , people don &apos;t know me .
Because , after all , everybody &apos;s going to die .
And I was angry , and I was talking about this , and I was talking to people about this .
I made a call .
And I said , &quot; &quot; My father used to use more than 16 years , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?
They &apos;re in Philadelphia .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if you don &apos;t need to do that , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t have anything , you don &apos;t have anything to do that .
So , I decided to call my birth birthday , which is a lot of fun , and I decided to do a lot of my work , and I decided to do that , but I &apos;d like to go back to a daily basis .
So I did this — that &apos;s — that &apos;s — that &apos;s — so I did this — that — so — so — so I did this — that — so — so — so I did this — that — so — so — so I did this — that — so — so — so — so I did this — this — and so I did this — that — so — so — so — so — so I did this — this — and so I did this — so — so
In the morning of the morning , I was a <unk> <unk> .
And that was a beautiful experience for me , because I started to be the first time that I started to die .
And I had to think about it .
Because every time I thought I had always thought , I think I can &apos;t help people , and when I think about it , I can &apos;t tell you what they want to talk about .
And when people talk about them , and they talk about them , and they talk about what I &apos;m talking about .
And then ...
And so that &apos;s how they communicate .
And that day , I &apos;m really afraid .
And this was my story because I &apos;ve been interested in doing things in the years .
I had 27 years old , and I thought , I know .
But I didn &apos;t know .
So I &apos;ve been doing this for the next day , and then again , this time , and this time , I &apos;ve been talking about this time , and I &apos;m going to die , because I &apos;m going to die , and I needed it , and I needed it .
So I thought I would have been a year , and I thought I would have been thinking about some of the reasons why I can &apos;t tell you about some things .
But it &apos;s not about 17 years old .
And I &apos;ve been doing it as well as a couple of years , and I &apos;ve been doing it as well , and I &apos;ve been doing it as well , and I was trying to do it as well as a teenager .
And I thought that I need to be educated .
So I went back to Oregon , Oregon , which was at the center of the pyramid .
800 kilometers .
So what ? What ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Oh , you want to read this one ?
<unk> ...
You &apos;ve got special talks to you .
And over the course of two years , I ended up spending a year with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My father came to my father . He was <unk> .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m ace of you , but we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on , but we don &apos;t know what to do with this stuff .
I started talking about the fact that we can &apos;t do this , I can &apos;t go to them . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I started to get away from the race , and I started back again .
<unk> <unk> , I came up to Washington , I came up to Washington , where I was standing here from Idaho to Washington , D.C.
In the Montana two years ago , I was born in Montana , and I had to go back to Bangladesh .
Two years to stay here for two years .
( Laughter ) And it happened . I got to school in two years , and I got educated to me .
There &apos;s two stories of Montana .
The first is that it &apos;s going to happen when I saw it .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be troubled by this , &quot; &quot; he gave me 150 bucks .
You &apos;re going to go to South America , <unk> ? &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; <unk> and <unk> , &quot; &quot; in southern America .
So I did this .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; Okay , John , John , for a student , &quot; &quot; you can use it as a student , and you can use it as a student in college , and you can use it as a student .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , if you don &apos;t know , you can &apos;t take any of you in the world .
And if you don &apos;t solve it , and we &apos;re going to solve the solutions , and they &apos;re going to be solved , and then they &apos;re not going to go . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re great . They &apos;re not going to go .
They were great to help me .
And I &apos;m going to try to do it very well , and I &apos;m going to try to get to what I &apos;m going to do in this way .
So , in this case , I &apos;m not going to take care of you as well .
I was at the first time in the middle of class , at the time , at the time .
My friend , my friend , my friend , my friend , <unk> <unk> : The name of John Francis said to them , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , it won — that &apos;s the last generation .
And all of the things that have happened is that they &apos;re not .
( Laughter ) I &apos;d never thought I &apos;d had the time to get my thesis .
But I was at that point .
After two generations , they would go through our bodies .
I found a lot of things , and I found a lot of things out of this .
And the head of everyone is telling us , John &apos;s trying to figure out what it is — I don &apos;t know , but I think it &apos;s , you know , we &apos;re going to see the tree of the tree . Yes , it &apos;s a <unk> .
No , it doesn &apos;t . It &apos;s not that — it &apos;s not .
( Applause )
<unk> .
No , he &apos;s talking about the fact that he &apos;s going to die .
So this is what happened to me , and we &apos;ve been discussing this debate .
I can &apos;t go back to this journey , and it &apos;s just to say that .
But I &apos;ve been doing something I learned , and sometimes I think that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing in my first question , but I &apos;ve been thinking , well , well , I &apos;m going to ask them .
And I thought , if you don &apos;t think about it , and if you don &apos;t think about it , and if you don &apos;t think about it .
So I did .
My father came to visit my father , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , we don &apos;t know , but ... &quot; &quot; And you know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to talk to you .
What do I do with my company ?
And two years ago , he wrote about the fact that he spent two years on the bus .
Nobody &apos;s ever met with oil .
But there &apos;s been something — Exxon Valdez .
And I was the only man who said to the oil crisis in the U.S.
My father came up anyway .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a lot of attention to what this is going on . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t use a car .
He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to tell you , &quot; &quot; I have to ask you , &quot; &quot; because you &apos;re doing better , you &apos;re doing better things , and you &apos;re going to get it back to me .
And I had to go back to the outside of the Atlantic Ocean , and I &apos;d have to go back to the Atlantic Ocean , and we &apos;ve got to have a third day for seven years and one day .
And I started with my <unk> <unk> , and I started talking about <unk> <unk> .
Because it &apos;s because it &apos;s because it &apos;s a man who doesn &apos;t know , you know , when you &apos;re going to get rid of it , it &apos;s not the sound of a man who &apos;s going to die .
And I did thank my surprise , and I was fascinated by , because they didn &apos;t know me .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
And they &apos;re going to ask me about the fact that they can &apos;t help me .
And this is something that was the size of this guy — it was a <unk> .
In fact , there &apos;s a very important thing — we need to be <unk> .
He &apos;s going to work for me .
My father said , &quot; &quot; This is &quot; &quot; this <unk> , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still not .
I was on the Coast of the Coast Coast Redwoods .
You can &apos;t solve all the problems for the U.S. — the fact that the oil sector is at the level of the economy .
20 years ago , if someone told me , &quot; &quot; John , if you want to make a <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah , I &apos;d like to be . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , go back to the right , go back to the right , and go back to the right stage . &quot; &quot; And then they said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m an <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m an <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Man , you know , you want to go .
So how does this happen ? How ?
Would you like to be able to figure out how simple things can be , and how do you make it easy ?
The streets of the Coast Redwoods are beautiful .
And after that — I was just a single year ago — I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m just a year ago . &quot; &quot; And I went back to the bathroom , and I went to see the entire Islands of the entire Islands as well as possible .
So the key is that we &apos;ve gone — I &apos;m going to tell you about why I &apos;m going to tell you to tell you about what I &apos;m going to tell you to tell you about what I &apos;m going to tell you about .
I started talking about what I started talking about .
And we had to be able to go to the environment that we have to do , but we had to be able to do it in the environment .
And they were <unk> — it was about people , and we &apos;re not talking about people , and we &apos;re doing it .
And it &apos;s not just because it doesn &apos;t matter , and it &apos;s not just because it &apos;s not just because it doesn &apos;t matter , but it &apos;s not just because it doesn &apos;t matter .
And if we don &apos;t think about the environment we &apos;re going to see in the environment , we &apos;re going to see that we &apos;re going to see that we &apos;re going to die .
And that was what I wanted .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; It was my own sense of my life , and I started working on it — and I started to get out of it .
It &apos;s the point of this story , and I realized that I still couldn &apos;t use it .
I &apos;d like to go through the manuscript — my famous prison ceremony , and my prison prison — and I didn &apos;t know what had happened to me because I didn &apos;t know anything .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said to me , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and <unk> <unk> .
And I said to him , &quot; &quot; Where are you ?
I didn &apos;t have to show you , I didn &apos;t have to show you .
And I came back the GMT — doctors , and I went to the world and I left the world .
What did I do with this ?
And the way the road went to the head .
<unk> me .
What am I saying I was saying , &quot; &quot; What am I saying to thank God ?
And I found that after 150 years of filming , I came to realize that I was going to die , I &apos;m going to die .
I was a professor , and I was on my side .
I was in my prison using my <unk> <unk> .
How can we go ?
Because at the moment , I was able to use my voice to me as well as possible .
But the difference was that I didn &apos;t have my name , I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m going to have my name , but I &apos;ve never been able to use myself using my voice .
So I &apos;m going to be able to go back to the GMT .
Professor <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so I realized that I only have any other kind of life , and I thought , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m not going to die .
You know , we can do this .
I had to change .
And because they &apos;re going to die , because they &apos;re always going to be alive .
And because the end of the end , I was sending to prison .
I didn &apos;t know who I would know .
But I knew this is necessary .
I knew that the only way to get here is that this is the only way we can get here today .
And I know , very often , we have a lot of time in ourselves , but there are places where we don &apos;t think we &apos;re always going to survive .
And what we have is that we are going to be able to go to where we &apos;re going to have new ecosystems , where we &apos;re going to have new maps of what we have .
And I &apos;d like to go back to the next point where you &apos;re going to get to the next point where you &apos;re going to get to the next one , which is where you can get to where you have , which is that day , you know , we have something on this road .
We are now .
We must have known about the past of the past , as Francesca .
And if I &apos;m telling you , if I can &apos;t tell you , if I can &apos;t explain to you , if I &apos;m here to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you about that .
Now , I know when I was here , I think you can influence me .
Now , if you &apos;re looking at the world — this is what we call the world , and this is <unk> , for example , for instance , to take the TED Talk to the world .
And because we &apos;re interacting with the environment , it &apos;s what we have to do with our interactions with our interactions .
So I &apos;d like to close my project here , and I &apos;d like to close my project here .
Thank you .
( Applause )
And if you think about it in the United States , if you &apos;re a believer in the United States , and ask the question , &quot; Are you going to die ? &quot;
And what you &apos;re saying is , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
This is <unk> , and he says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the story ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the name ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
There &apos;s <unk> names , and they just say , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s just a little bit like you &apos;re going to die .
Now , imagine if you can imagine what &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; where you can &apos;t tell the man , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the name , &quot; &quot; is the name of what &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is the name of this ?
And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , this is a blockchain , and you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the name of you ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , why ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , why ?
They have names .
So look at the Google of Google , 15 , 16 , 16 , 18 , 18 , 17 .
There &apos;s all this <unk> names that are connected between the bricks of the <unk> .
And you know , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you prioritize ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you design your house ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s easy .
And this is the third of the blockchain , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
My first house is <unk> <unk> .
And after that , after that , I was able to get rid of it .
This is <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> and <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the most important thing to see is that we have never seen any of the world &apos;s religions , to see if we don &apos;t have anything right to understand .
For example , when you &apos;re in the tradition , you know that they &apos;re going to be able to do their job .
In the months that you &apos;re healthy , you &apos;re going to get money , and if you don &apos;t have any money , you can &apos;t get any money , because they can &apos;t do any money , because they &apos;re weak when you &apos;re weak , you &apos;re going to change your time .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) We have a lot of fun , we think , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t like a &quot; &quot; — two , three , three .
But I think it &apos;s like a &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; to the African piece of music , which is the end of a demonstration .
I mean , it &apos;s just not just that you can &apos;t read it , but you see it in two , three , four , four , four .
And this map is true .
I mean , there &apos;s this phrase that , if you have a straight about about India , it &apos;s true that it &apos;s true .
So if you &apos;ve ever been able to go and look at it in the other way , and maybe there &apos;s a great story , or if you have great expectations , it can be true .
<unk> <unk> . ( Applause )
