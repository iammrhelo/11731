I was 11 years old , and in one of the years , I was like a little bit of a <unk> <unk> .
My father was a little dancer in the BBC I was in a little <unk> .
And the reason that we were not at that time was a <unk> , because the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban are back to the Taliban ! &quot; &quot; — I &apos;m the fathers .
I didn &apos;t realize what this meant , but I knew how to do it happy .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go to school . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll go to school .
Nobody had ever met .
It &apos;s going to go to school .
I had only six years to get the Taliban to girls and girls to get their girls out of time .
So in five years , I was going to go out and go out and dig the window and go out and go out and go to the bathroom and go to the secret school .
That &apos;s the only way to get education to be educated .
Every day , I &apos;ve been able to get a different way of where none of them can &apos;t go .
You can &apos;t get the market in the market , just say , you can &apos;t just get your breath .
And when you &apos;re in the middle of a school , you &apos;re in a little bit of a little bit like a little bit of a little bit in the middle of a little girl .
It was comfortable with the time , but it would be a cold , <unk> .
We knew that we were all afraid of the fact that we can &apos;t get the rest of our lives , and we knew that we were all about the way we were .
And yet , the Taliban are a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
And I always think that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with our brains .
What if we can &apos;t believe what ?
Where are we going to live ?
And yet , the school was the place where we wanted to be a high school .
I was actually very lucky , and I was a very lucky story to do with my family , which was a story of mine .
My father was a human being in my own life .
He was a different kind of attitude from a different kind of life , and he was in the course of the village , and he insisted that he was not known for the school , and it was <unk> by his father , and he was murdered by his father .
But my mother had been to the school of my mother .
They &apos;re not .
Two years ago , I had started to die , and girls and girls and girls and girls and girls .
And the night — this was the first time that we had the first time to have the education .
It was also not the <unk> , and he was not the <unk> of his own , and he was not the <unk> of the Taliban , but despite the Taliban , the Taliban .
And because of her , I was more than the education of the prison agency .
The Taliban are <unk> , the way , the time , the time , the time , the <unk> , the always <unk> and the <unk> of a <unk> light bulb .
I was <unk> , and my father , and my father , he said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t , you can &apos;t read anything , you can &apos;t get anything in your pocket .
It can be <unk> . You can put your home in the room , you can go to the house .
But the only thing that we &apos;re always worried about is that you &apos;re not going to be afraid of the fact that you &apos;re going to have your experience , and if you &apos;re not going to go through the school , you &apos;re going to get to school , and you &apos;re going to get away from the school .
Now , you &apos;re still going to get the <unk> ? &quot; &quot; This morning , I was 22 years old .
I grew up in a country where we had a decade of <unk> in a country .
And I think that &apos;s how I can get a few percent of the middle school , but if you &apos;re not going to get the middle of the time , I &apos;m going to get it from the middle of the time , and I &apos;m going to get it out .
I &apos;m in the middle of the closet , and I &apos;m going to be here as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) One of the guys who was first invited me was to be an ecologist , and I was killing my grandfather for my first time to school , because I was an ecologist .
It &apos;s not because I &apos;m not a woman , but I &apos;m a young woman in Kabul , but I was the first woman to get it out of the Kabul .
( Applause ) My team convinced me .
There are great numbers , and the reason I &apos;ve been doing is that we are more than the ones that are more likely to be .
And so , to that , we can &apos;t teach a global global institution to be educated in the education of the country .
So , it &apos;s because women are still in the school , where women are still risky , in the country , in the first boarding school .
And the most important thing is that we see the students who are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I see how they &apos;re working , and they &apos;re not talking about how they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re not talking about their own existence , but they &apos;re not talking about their own existence .
I &apos;m like , you know , you &apos;re going to see his eyes and I can &apos;t tell you the truth and the truth , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to call the <unk> of somebody .
A month ago , with the <unk> , the <unk> had to meet the bomb , the roads , the bomb , the bomb , the bomb , the bomb , they &apos;ve lost them a few minutes .
He stole his home phone and his voice , and he was the voice of the voice , and he was able to go to school , and you &apos;d get to the bathroom , and you &apos;d have to go through the school .
And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to die anymore , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not a <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m not a <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the thing I discovered about time was that sometimes , the <unk> of all the people who are not ignored by the fact that they &apos;re not just believed that they &apos;re not going to ignore them , they &apos;re not going to be able to get their enemies from their enemies .
This is what we &apos;re not going to have in the Gulf of the Gulf , which is not the <unk> .
Actually , our ancestors were brilliant and <unk> , and I &apos;m not a <unk> , but I &apos;m a <unk> , like a boy , who &apos;s a parent , who &apos;s a parent .
The Taliban have hundreds of farmers who are going to go to school , like the Taliban — that &apos;s like , you know , <unk> .
And what we &apos;re doing is , in the course , the girls are in Afghanistan , are in three million .
( Applause ) It seems to be very different from the United States .
The Americans are <unk> by the American <unk> .
The U.S. military was a long time after the U.S. military , after the fact , was very long .
But when I met a woman , I was at school , and when I was working , and when we were able to get them , you get a certificate , and you get a lot of time , and you get a lot of time , and you get a lot of time .
For me , I was going to be able to get my friends from my childhood and my daughters , and the girls who were watching the girls and the girls are more than one day .
They &apos;re not a big fan of my own .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
They &apos;re like the <unk> of the <unk> , and everybody who has these cute jobs that have been so cute , that you go down for about two half hours , you go down for about two half hours , and you go down for about two half hours , and you go down for about two half hours , and you go down for the two half hours , you &apos;re going to go down for about two half hours , and you go down for about two half hours , and you go down for the
And you see here , you see the <unk> , you see , you see , you know , you &apos;re a <unk> , and you &apos;re a <unk> , you &apos;re a <unk> , you &apos;re going to get a little bit of it .
So glowing <unk> , moist , moist , moist <unk> .
And this is cute . And finally , it &apos;s cute .
<unk> , this is design design .
The right thing is , every one of them , every one of them .
This is the true risk of the universe . And that &apos;s what happened to the world .
underwater diving , underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> — underwater <unk> —
It &apos;s a place where you can &apos;t find a place in the courtyard and the background and the background .
The female &apos;s actually see the monkey &apos;s self than the only one that makes it more than the only more than it ever makes .
Take a look at the size . Watch the number on the right , the right is the right to the left .
A step back , and I &apos;m going to get to the point where you can &apos;t go back .
I &apos;m a <unk> . I love my <unk> . This is a giant <unk> .
Watch them . You get them inside , and they &apos;re <unk> like they &apos;re <unk> .
They &apos;re not going to be daunted .
This is the rock game . It &apos;s a lot of new things , and it &apos;s a lot of new things .
And they &apos;re a nightmare . Right ? Now , Roger O &apos;Grady , who will not get him to get him .
And the tricky thing says the diagram is , &quot; &quot; The Swiss , the old .
The best thing to go is to be a big deal when it &apos;s possible .
It &apos;s coming back . Let &apos;s go back .
One . Three . Three .
<unk> , who &apos;s been the 25th anniversary of Kim , but the foreign world , who &apos;s been on the outside , is the story of Kim , but the foreign world , who is the minister of the British , who &apos;s been told , who &apos;s been on the outside , is the story of Kim , who &apos;s been on the outside , who was the minister of the British , who was the minister of the British , but I was a foreign minister .
Everything is about to be able to get to the grave .
When we see the first public space , we can see the first public space crisis .
And I was not going to be able to go back to the bathroom .
And now , I &apos;m going to get the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
And so I think that &apos;s another thing that &apos;s going to be called the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s another <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a part of the story of the universe .
I think the North <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was born against the terrible rapes in the terrible disaster .
And I think for the sake of the story .
Every single thing I think about is that you can &apos;t read about anything .
And the answer is that you can &apos;t answer questions .
A police worker , that one person worker .
But most of the people in the U.S.
And while I was lucky , I was very lucky , I was very lucky , and I was so lucky to have a lot of Northern Geographic .
A new language , after business , would have been a new language , and then the whole thing would be changed in a new way .
I was in southern South Africa .
We all live , but they were a 67 years old , and then they were <unk> , and they were going to die .
Or in the South , or the North <unk> ?
So I started to ask how to save them .
I was trying to go back to the North Pole .
To the extent , we need to deal with the <unk> in China .
I &apos;m standing up with my parents and I can stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up
I can &apos;t get to the bathroom .
But it &apos;s just a brief moment , but it &apos;s just a brief moment .
They &apos;re very repetitive , but they &apos;re going to be <unk> in the short of South South Asia .
I never knew someone I &apos;d never known .
I did what I did , and I was able to get the same money , and I &apos;m not the only finding the opportunity to get the same number of people &apos;s shoes and work on the other .
I was like , that was my grandfather &apos;s village .
They &apos;re very little , and they &apos;re not going to be able to go through the market .
I &apos;m sure that the TED <unk> also can be both too .
This is the gentleman we designed in 1908 .
We can &apos;t get it into the form of the environment .
It &apos;s going to be a building that &apos;s going to go through the building blocks .
You know , kids are very upset with the kids .
It looks like the building blocks .
Why do you think that ?
My grandmother told me to be a <unk> , &quot; Don &apos;t worry . &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not possible . &quot; &quot; But he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , how can you be able to get the Kosovars to be able to get the <unk> of the <unk> ?
Kids will get to the end . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; And of course , the public is saying , &quot; &quot; The <unk> must be absolute . &quot;
So we &apos;ve been studying the press , but I was on the board of the meeting .
There are three satellites in the building .
They let you go to the <unk> .
But okay , they &apos;re using other words .
They &apos;re going to get to the top of the mosquito .
Kids are not going to be daunted .
( Laughter ) Sometimes you &apos;re going to get married to a tree that &apos;s close to a tree .
This boy you see this boy who loves the tree , which is that she was able to get it .
( Laughter ) Every single thing is <unk> , they &apos;re sitting outside the continents .
This is very cute .
I was able to get rid of the <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) You &apos;re not going to be able to get it .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We &apos;ve done it as possible , because we want to see the kids , but we want to see the kids not just under the middle of the curriculum .
The door is high , but the ceiling is very high to see the ceiling .
This is where we have been left — there &apos;s a species of water in the water .
You see , you can see your <unk> , you can &apos;t see your <unk> , you can &apos;t see your <unk> , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
But you see , boy , I can &apos;t get them to sleep with the water , and they &apos;ll be able to get them through the water .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a completely flat time when you &apos;re in the year 2000 .
There &apos;s no excuse and the <unk> .
And that means that &apos;s made up of the fact that we are not in the middle of the world .
There &apos;s no way to eat .
There is no way to change .
Most of the kids are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But there &apos;s nothing that doesn &apos;t have to be done .
Because there &apos;s no excuse here .
And the <unk> says that if you &apos;re standing on the deck of the closet , the boy is standing in the room and can go to it .
<unk> <unk> , where you can go and go back to the rest of the closet .
( Laughter ) It was like , you know , kids like that , and they &apos;re afraid of laughter .
And here , they &apos;re going to go back and go back .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
The second is that we think it &apos;s very important to be a <unk> .
You know , kids are better than the teachers .
And there &apos;s a lot of people everywhere .
And when kids are married , they were able to go high school and go to high school .
You know , the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> .
They have to sound .
And you know , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to speak to the middle of the auditorium .
They should be able to have to be able to have fun .
You know , this is what you &apos;re doing in time .
This is okay .
And we can see that we can &apos;t get a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to get our oceans from the way .
They &apos;re going to be a 50 degrees of <unk> .
Water is <unk> .
They &apos;re not going to be daunted .
So they &apos;re not going to be able to be a <unk> .
And we &apos;re in the room , and we &apos;re in the process .
And they work in the stratosphere .
And the reason we get to the aid is actually .
They &apos;re not .
( Laughter ) This is the kid &apos;s dilemma .
This is what we &apos;re looking at .
This is what we &apos;re going to do .
Here &apos;s a good conversation here .
We have a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is working with the <unk> of the <unk> .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m more optimistic . ( Laughter )
Every classroom is not a <unk> , no one has a nightmare .
<unk> in the Santa <unk> , the way that I get out of the ice .
This is the extra thing that &apos;s built on the bottom of the head , where he was building straight down .
We have five meters of carbon , and we &apos;re seven meters .
I was very proud of the fact that we have a lot of fun .
The idea is that we can &apos;t see the idea .
We let a girl let a girl to give a girl for a girl .
They work with their peers .
They &apos;re not going to be a lot of them .
They &apos;re not afraid , but they &apos;re not going to be daunted .
I &apos;m not going to be daunted . He &apos;s my grandmother .
( Laughter ) So that &apos;s where you &apos;re looking at the <unk> of your <unk> .
Then you have the other kids in .
You know , it &apos;s very <unk> .
( Laughter ) The driver &apos;s learning how to make a driver &apos;s driver .
And it &apos;s a little bit like a <unk> , which is a little bit of time .
They &apos;re not going to be able to make a lot of help to get together .
This is a <unk> , and we can &apos;t get these kinds of opportunities to help us .
This is a <unk> , a long boy , a long boy , a long boy .
We &apos;re not <unk> , but we &apos;re not afraid of the <unk> .
It &apos;s not just that little girl .
So this little morning , this little morning , I took six meters of the little Christmas road .
But I &apos;m still wrong .
These kids are now moving 4,000 meters in the middle of a wedding day .
And the kids are the highest athletic quality of the highest athletic quality .
The lesson is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get them to the bathroom . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not going to tell them , like the flock of <unk> .
They &apos;ll be able to get on the top . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m not going to be daunted . ( Laughter )
I think that &apos;s what I think , and we have no protection , but they &apos;re not going to be the enemy .
They &apos;re also <unk> .
Because it &apos;s because it &apos;s how we live in life .
I think that the world is changing the world and people are not going to be able to change the world .
This building is one of the reasons why children are becoming a kid .
Thank you .
( Applause )
In the 1970s , China was <unk> in the 1970s , two years from the World War II .
I got a resident at all the time I was in the first grade of the entire village to be able to get the minaret to the prison .
But the lion said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I was in my village , and I was a doctor , and I was a soldier like that .
And then he was a <unk> , and he was a <unk> , and he was the only way that they &apos;re going to get warm and warm in the way .
It &apos;s not really important to get my job .
But my wish to be my favorite is to be a Chinese opera .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
I have to be doing a young couple of ages of the opera , and I &apos;ve been doing that , I &apos;ve been trying to get to the opera I had to go to the opera .
I wrote a letter to the high school in the school room for the high school .
But I think that my life is not a story .
Nobody believed I &apos;m serious .
But my friends would have been telling me that they were my friends like me , and they were afraid .
So I realized that I was late to the 15 years old .
I was not a time when I was born .
The second class you can &apos;t afford to be able to have a single <unk> , is that it &apos;s not the only <unk> .
But it was a <unk> .
Another way we can figure out how to explore .
Nobody &apos;s going to see me on the road ? No .
I did not drink my money .
I &apos;ve been doing this book by <unk> <unk> , who was a <unk> , who was a <unk> , who was a <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; &#93; And I took a model of the woman who was running the <unk> , and I took a model of the woman who was not a <unk> , and I found that I had to be a guy who &apos;s going to get the community to be &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &#93; — ( Laughter ) — that &apos;s the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot;
&#91; &quot; &quot; The <unk> of the <unk> &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) &#91; another &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Of course , the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be called &quot; &quot; <unk> meen , &quot; &quot; which is a <unk> story .
There &apos;s no use of any use of it to be a function .
The interesting thing is that it &apos;s very strange .
( Laughter ) This is the second of the other day .
But the fifth of me brought me to me . He said , &quot; &quot; Dad and your faith qualities are the qualities of the honor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called .
I think it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to get the chance to get the chance to be able to achieve the opportunity .
The new <unk> , the new way to me , gave me to compare the way to me .
This can be a lot of things to tell you .
For example , this map seemed odd to me , because it was very bizarre , because we &apos;re not going to be able to get this part of the world .
Never , I &apos;ve never met in the city of China , is not to be in the middle of the world .
In fact , the map shows the map of the map .
It &apos;s not a new thing to do with your life .
This is a standard <unk> world in the world .
In fact , there are also science in science and religions like the <unk> of religion .
It &apos;s helping us to get full of people and their peers in the Gulf .
And I &apos;m also thinking , well , the way we &apos;ve been studying the technology is that we &apos;re going to get to work on the daily life ?
So I started to read the <unk> in the process .
And so , I was afraid people who have been on the same side of the same , &#91; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; music : &quot; &quot; John Adams . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s the same as the story of my own English .
&#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; music : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; &quot; The writer Alice : The Work is &quot; &quot; the writer Alice Walker and <unk> , &quot; &quot; Alice <unk> : The King James <unk> , &quot; &quot; the same thing : The King James <unk> , who wrote the &quot; &quot; <unk> Force : &quot; &quot; The King James <unk> : The &quot; &quot; <unk> of Thrones : The &quot; &quot; <unk> Force : &quot; &quot; for example , &quot; &quot; for example , &quot; &quot; for example ,
For Jesus , they were the economic , political and political .
The interesting thing to be is that they were all of the things that were happening : they were all about the fact that they &apos;re going to be shared , and they &apos;re in social and social .
I &apos;m interested in the reading language that I &apos;m interested in , and I &apos;m interested in the picture of two languages .
&#91; &quot; &quot; The <unk> Trail : Thomas <unk> &#93; &#91; The &quot; &quot; <unk> : Water <unk> : The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For example , I realized that the word &quot; &quot; Aliens &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; in the Latin &quot; &quot; in the Latin , which is &quot; &quot; fastest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
It &apos;s a new word , &quot; &quot; The new word is &quot; &quot; to the new word . Yes !
( Laughter ) The past and the point of view , the journey of my life , is that I have to get the needle in the <unk> .
I could never look at the only one that I could ever read .
The <unk> of the people who are not born with the fact that they &apos;re not born with the other person &apos;s brains .
And the challenge of the challenge is that desire is not the only purpose of desire .
The key to the point of the question is that we can connect with the key to the point of view and the point of view , the key to the point of view .
And the desire to do it is to do it .
And it &apos;s because I &apos;m going to die , and I &apos;m a very time-consuming meeting , and I &apos;m a very time-consuming meeting .
And I &apos;m telling you , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t always do anything . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always going to share your life ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always telling you .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
If you &apos;re in your mind , you &apos;re not going to be able to see the <unk> , and the lower part is the <unk> , and the <unk> is the <unk> of your <unk> .
It just goes to the next round .
It &apos;s about the information that we have about the data .
To work today .
It &apos;s a <unk> . It &apos;s what we call it .
So I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a job in your head and ask him , &quot; &quot; Why am I ? &quot; &quot; Well , now , the night I &apos;m going to die , and you &apos;re going to get your home day and you &apos;re going to see your own profile and you &apos;re going to see your own profile .
( Laughter ) And this is a gift that &apos;s like , you know , that &apos;s a <unk> .
And I think that &apos;s the reason that we can &apos;t get the <unk> of this <unk> , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to get back to you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to get back to the point of the two stories , like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ll get back to that two . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But every day , if you &apos;re not even as good as the job of the job , we will not be able to get

We have a tendency to think that there &apos;s a global global revolution .

But what I was doing is that the <unk> didn &apos;t have any sense of the <unk> .
The last night I &apos;m going to get the last slide to the last slide I &apos;ve been doing with the last night we &apos;ve been able to get the last few months of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

I &apos;m a doctor . He &apos;s <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re not talking about the legacy of the organization , the curiosity , the curiosity , the curiosity , and the anxiety of anxiety and the science of science , the science , the science , the science , the theoretical science , the theoretical science , and that &apos;s not silly .
<unk> in the last time , I was going to die , and I &apos;d like to go down .
Some of them are not us that they can &apos;t tell us , they &apos;re not afraid of us .
But we have a lot of things that are not , in fact , that we have to be wrong .
The police don &apos;t get to the police officer in the trenches , and we can &apos;t stop them . They &apos;re going to be afraid of the fact that they don &apos;t get sick . ( Laughter ) We want to modify the idea of good ideas .
I &apos;ll show you a little bit of a nasty twist .
And the reason I can &apos;t do this is to do this , which is NBC , for the producers .
The Maasais &apos; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> .

And that &apos;s because you can use it to be very much of the time , but it &apos;s because it &apos;s about to be a student from student to college .
( Laughter ) So , this works like this : When I was thinking about the fact that I could have been able to do this , I &apos;m going to be able to get the courage to get the next thing you can &apos;t do with it .
It &apos;s something like this .
I &apos;m going to show you .
( Laughter ) You &apos;re a <unk> . This is a little bit of <unk> .
And we are doing it again for the research of scientific discovery .
And it turns out that this is the slow down .
( Laughter ) ( Music ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) No , no , no .
Of course , the question is , is this tool that drives your behavior out of the way ?
And the answer is , yes , your <unk> will be in the palm of your <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The teacher doesn &apos;t just have the idea , but it &apos;s also <unk> .
And so , you &apos;ll notice that the short line is , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
People are <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
We &apos;re doing everything we can do with our lives . We &apos;re in the middle of the world , and we &apos;re in the process of the <unk> .
And we &apos;ve done this .
We took two seconds , and we took a shot to the point where you could take a shot away from the point of view , and then you get a blank slate .
And the third 50 percent of the income , which is , is that we can &apos;t get the <unk> .
This was a very exciting example of the puzzle that we &apos;ve done .
It &apos;s a <unk> , which is a <unk> , a <unk> .
This is a future of <unk> <unk> .
People who are not <unk> or aren &apos;t ?
I have some idea of this stuff that I &apos;m proposing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with people &apos;s faces .
Every decade , average IQ is the number three .
It &apos;s very interesting .
And I think it &apos;s like a scientific currency , or a scientific currency .
<unk> and religion ?
This is like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
These are two different things .
It &apos;s not the <unk> , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
We can &apos;t think about the success of our lives .
So for all our generations of all , they &apos;re the way we can &apos;t get .
What if you could ask , &quot; &quot; What are you more wrong ? &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Why should you be afraid of the ad , &quot; &quot; to the extent that you can &apos;t see , the other way to go away from the road , the next to the Big Bang , the <unk> of the <unk> ?
The verb is &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; by one of the <unk> , &quot; &quot; by the way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
The question is , if you &apos;re in the world , it &apos;s more real than the answer .
And before we begin to realize that the universe is missing to the world , we have to know that there &apos;s not the world &apos;s .
Are you more real than the ones that are more real than the ones that are going to be able to get the people to be able to get the ? &quot; &quot; The World Wide World News , who &apos;s <unk> , is that ?
( Laughter ) And things like this , when things like Sydney , you &apos;re going to get into the Sydney Opera .
And you &apos;re talking about your kids : &quot; &quot; then it &apos;s a great deal .
I think you &apos;ll have to tell you the second story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to write all sorts of smart design bags .
This is what this is the way you &apos;re dealing with .
( Applause ) You can tell your story , but that doesn &apos;t make anything , it doesn &apos;t have any idea .
It doesn &apos;t have a lot of things .
This is what I &apos;m going to do with my model , to work with the design of design .
And I can tell you that the scientists can &apos;t hear about the dark energy , the dark energy , the dark matter that we can &apos;t deal with , as it turns out , when they cope with .

And this is what we &apos;re going to do with my design design for the first time .
But the same question is , is it more than the size of the world ?
Would you like to be able to get your own <unk> , or your <unk> ?

This is a pattern of &quot; &quot; Kodak &quot; &quot; by the idea of Kodak .
Somebody &apos;s ready to get outside of the world .
camera &apos;s been ready — it &apos;s just like this .
( Laughter ) You can &apos;t even think about many of these things , or even if you &apos;re a <unk> or you &apos;re in real time , you might think it &apos;s true .
<unk> more trust , the more popular that we have , the more we can get to the oppressed and the Turks .
For example , the <unk> <unk> <unk> had two problems .
The first one was , the fact that I had no idea of the <unk> .
The second , the <unk> , and the fact that we were able to understand that , to see that we can &apos;t understand the way we can &apos;t change the way we can &apos;t .
And he wrote this sort of thing : I did think that the most successful planet is to have three generations of the planet &apos;s worth of .
And it &apos;s why we don &apos;t think that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
So without the good luck , you &apos;ll never have to go to the good phone with your neighbors , and you &apos;ll never get a good deal with your car .
This is what we call the <unk> of the <unk> .
This is a book that <unk> <unk> who had been able to deal with the <unk> of the <unk> who are trying to deal with the way that we get to the <unk> .
And the thing that was discovered was that these two things were known . The first time we had a good fortune of being a system , and there was a good fortune to be more , and more quickly , and so on , I think it &apos;s about the speed of Kepler , and it &apos;s going to be Kepler .
We knew that this telescope would be a <unk> .
This is the result of the <unk> .
The sad thing is that the <unk> is the one that seems full of scientific intuition .
One of the reasons I was born was a very understanding of the first time , and I was amazed by the fact that it was serious .
We &apos;ve done it all around the trunk .
This is the <unk> <unk> .

So , for this , &quot; &quot; The Guardian &quot; &quot; wrote about the article &quot; &quot; The Guardian . &quot; &quot; And we can &apos;t tell that we can &apos;t tell the story of how much we &apos;re going to die .
It &apos;s 12 , it &apos;s going to go down to a billion light years , and it &apos;s not a <unk> .
And yet , you know how much the little worm might be in the low end of the small knot .

( Music ) The way we use it works is to go to a billion light years into the process of the computer .
It can be a <unk> to share with the <unk> , but that &apos;s the top of the time .

What do you do ?
There &apos;s a <unk> of the world that I think is the best way to use the world , and as you can use it to be the <unk> of the <unk> .
We use the tools of the people who are not using the luxury of goods or the <unk> of the <unk> , but like this , like , the country &apos;s <unk> , more than the country , because they &apos;re more likely to use the foreign government , because they don &apos;t have the same as the <unk> of the local state in the country , because they don &apos;t have the same .
But this is the service of the external <unk> that you have to do .
It &apos;s possible to avoid the <unk> .
That &apos;s what happened to the point of the story .
The Arab Spring and the head of the Arab world is a kind of <unk> ?
<unk> were in the secret of the hidden <unk> of the night in the <unk> , in the secret of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> in a lot of <unk> .
Between these <unk> , they have a <unk> , and they have a <unk> <unk> , and they have a <unk> <unk> , and they have a <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be able to get all the disconnect , to allow the entire community to be under control of the device .
This is the tool that we can &apos;t get to the field of the establishment in order to change the way we can &apos;t get .
I &apos;m going to be able to see that in the middle of the world .
<unk> , Western <unk> , <unk> <unk> , is that they have a tool that can help us with the power of the Western world .
But the Western Treasury is also in our own way .
For example , a couple weeks ago , I was a <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which was the <unk> of the German German army , which was three weeks ago .
You can &apos;t get the <unk> of your car , which is your phone call .
Now , you &apos;re going to get it out .
It will follow the Internet .
<unk> <unk> , who knows that all the way to be calls is , knows your online , listen to your friends , who knows your work .
And the very few guys , the big question , is the big question , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s not a good thing , but I &apos;m not the <unk> of the <unk> , it &apos;s not a lot of effect .
Why don &apos;t you be afraid ?
We don &apos;t have anything secret . &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s very frustrating .
<unk> .
It &apos;s not a <unk> .
It &apos;s not about the safety and the globalization of this safety .
It &apos;s dependent on the relationship between this is and the knowledge between the data .
And the reason that we believe in the year 2000 is that we believe that we could find that we could be able to find a bunch of things , and that was the result of the message that we could do .
But if you were in the middle of the last 50 years , the typical person would have been able to play the eye at the time ?
And this is the problem , and the question is , in 50 years , is to be afraid of that .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
And I say , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry you &apos;re here .
And this was the first <unk> in Washington , DC , where we were <unk> in Washington , D.C.
My friends and my friends are there to be told me to be afraid .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die you &apos;re going to be here . &quot; &quot; My mother said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; He said Johnny was saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry you &apos;re going to hear &quot; &quot; you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry you &apos;re going to hear &quot; &quot; you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry you &apos;re going to hear &quot; &quot; you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry you &apos;re going to hear . &quot;
( Laughter ) Imagine that 17 years of <unk> and <unk> are <unk> and <unk> .
My father said to me , &quot; &quot; This is &quot; &quot; — this is &quot; &quot; — this is &quot; &quot; — this is &quot; &quot; — I think , &quot; &quot; — I think my father said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m this <unk> . &quot; &quot; And my father said , &quot; &quot; This is &quot; &quot; — I think my father said , &quot; &quot; — this is &quot; &quot; — this is &quot; &quot; — I think my father said , &quot; &quot; — this is &quot; &quot; — this is &quot; &quot; —
They were <unk> , because they knew that they came to the Gulf , and they knew that they came to the Gulf , and they knew that they came to the Gulf , and they were learning what they came from .
And 17 years of my life , I said , &quot; &quot; God , who &apos;s a <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God , who are my <unk> ?
And I realized that this is the story and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> , I realized , was that , I realized , that was the courage and the <unk> and the <unk> , I realized that this is the courage and the <unk> and the <unk> , and I realized that this is the courage and the <unk> and the <unk> , and I realized that this is the courage and the <unk> and the <unk> , and I realized that this is the courage and the <unk> and the <unk> , and I
My father said , &quot; &quot; Yes , he &apos;s going to be the <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to take the word &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; which is the way we &apos;re going to get the <unk> .
And yet , this is our journey , although we &apos;re not talking about this .
I want to think about my belief that I can &apos;t be afraid of my life , and I want to tell you about my own story .
My country &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , time , was the moment when I was a slave , that was a <unk> <unk> .
I decided that I was so frustrated that I could use my <unk> to use my <unk> .
This is a big thing for California .
This is a huge thing to be able to see that I live in the tiny part of my living room , but it was a big thing to do with the last 350 or 350 people in the morning .
And I started to dig up with my colleagues and I started to dig up , people — what were you doing when they were born .
They were saying , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to get to the extent to the environment for the environment , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;re doing that for us , right ?
I was able to do that , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get to the evil , &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get bored people to be bored , &quot; &quot; and I think that people can &apos;t tell me that people were afraid of me .
Because they were always afraid of the <unk> .
And I was afraid of the people who were talking about this , and I was talking about this thing .
I &apos;ve been able to ask the question .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve used to use more of the more <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you have that ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I knew about the fact that we had not to do anything about the environment that we have in that time .
They &apos;re in Philadelphia .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , the fact that everybody is important , they &apos;re very much , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t have anything you don &apos;t have to do , you don &apos;t have to have anything . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t have anything you can &apos;t do that , you don &apos;t have to have anything . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t have anything you can &apos;t do . &quot; &quot; And I said
So I decided to call my birth birthday , which is a lot of fun , and I decided to go very hard — and I decided to do that , but I &apos;d like to go through the study of a daily , but I &apos;ll be a daily planner , and I &apos;ll go back to a daily interview .
So I did this — this — that — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so — so —
I was a little bit asleep in the morning , and I was a <unk> <unk> .
And I was a beautiful experience for me , because I started to realize that I was the first time I started this as I was for the first time .
And I had to think about my grandmother .
Because I think I always think that I can &apos;t help people , and when I think about the people , and I think , in the way , they &apos;re going to talk about what they &apos;re going to talk about .
And when people speak , they &apos;re not afraid , and they &apos;re talking about what I &apos;m talking about , and they &apos;re talking about what I &apos;m talking about .
And then ...
So , we &apos;ve been able to get to the end of the end .
And then I really think that day I &apos;m really a <unk> , and I &apos;m really a really <unk> student .
And this was my story because I &apos;ve been interested in things , because I &apos;ve been doing things in the years .
I had 27 years old , and I thought , I know , I know .
But I didn &apos;t know .
So I did this , and I was going to ask for the next day , and this time , I was saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; I promised my story , because I had to go to the study , and I needed it to be a very good thing .
So I thought I &apos;d been a year , and I thought I &apos;d have a word , and I thought I &apos;d have a lot of things to tell you about things .
But this is the fact that this year , 17 years ago , I was 17 years old .
I &apos;ve been doing a lot of work , and I &apos;ve been doing it as well as a teenager , and I was working on my journey to my childhood and my colleagues , and I was trying to do it as well as a teenager .
And I thought , I need a training phone .
I went to the Oregon Metropolitan Council , which was the <unk> at the University of Oregon .
800 km of <unk> .
So , what about the trip , and what ?
I &apos;m going to get rid of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Oh , you want to read here the hell you &apos;re going to see here ?
<unk> ...
There &apos;s special instructions to you . They did this .
And I finished a year after two years of <unk> <unk> .
My father came to my father . He was on my head .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m ace of you , but we &apos;re doing it with the <unk> of the <unk> , but we can &apos;t know what to do with this .
I started talking about the fact that we can &apos;t do this , and I started to get away from the crowd , and I started to start the process again and started to start the process .
<unk> <unk> , I came to Washington , I came up to Washington , where I was here , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
I had to go back to Montana , and I had to go back to Montana , and I had to go back to Montana .
Two years in the room would be bad .
( Laughter ) And it happened . I got to school in two years from my school , and I got to school .
There are two stories of Montana .
The first is that it &apos;s going to be that when you &apos;re walking out of it , it &apos;s going to be that when you &apos;re walking out of it , it &apos;s going to be that when it &apos;s going to be on the surface of the closet , it &apos;s going to be that when it &apos;s going to be happening .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to be troubled by this , &quot; &quot; he gave me 150 bucks to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get the time back in the morning .
You &apos;re going to go to South America , <unk> ? &quot; &quot; I said to him — I was <unk> and <unk> , South America .
So I did this .
He said , &quot; &quot; Okay , John , John , who &apos;s a good , who &apos;s a college student , you can use your <unk> to take the middle of a school to get a lecture , to help you in a student .
And I said , &quot; &quot; And I think I &apos;ll tell you that all the way to get to the extent you can &apos;t take care of you all , you know , will not be saved .
And if you &apos;re going to solve the solutions and the choices that are not the good , and they &apos;re going to get solutions to the rest of the time , and then they &apos;re going to get the money . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re usually not getting bored .
I was a big part of my life , and I was a big part of my life .
And I think that &apos;s very much of the time that we can &apos;t be able to do this on the way that we have to have a significant scale , and that &apos;s what I would like to do .
And in this case , I was a little bit <unk> .
I had 13 seconds in the middle of the school class .
My friend , who was the gift of the <unk> to them , my friend , <unk> , who was a friend of mine , who was told , &quot; &quot; Hey Francis , you &apos;re going to die anymore — that &apos;s the last time .
And all of the sudden , you know , the number of people who are not the ones who are suffering from their enemies .
( Laughter ) I would have to see my first time was to get the first place .
But I was in that hospital , and I was in the front of them .
After two generations , they would go through our bodies .
I found a lot of things that I found in the classroom — these kinds of things , these kinds of things , they &apos;re afraid of these kinds of things — these kinds of things , they &apos;re afraid of these kinds of things .
Everyone would have thought of the head of what John <unk> is — I don &apos;t know , I think , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , but it &apos;s a <unk> , yes , the tree of tree .
No , no . It &apos;s not that — you know , you &apos;re going to get these things out .
I &apos;m doing that with your hand .
You can make a lot of fun .
No , he &apos;s telling me that he &apos;s talking about the fact that he &apos;s going to die .
So this was the debate about this debate , and we &apos;ve been discussing this debate .
I &apos;m going to get back to this journey and to be able to get it back to this point .
But I had something I learned from the way I learned from a woman , and sometimes I think it &apos;s my idea of what I think is really , but I &apos;m really sorry , but I &apos;m going to ask them .
And I thought , if you &apos;re going to die and you &apos;re going to die , and if you &apos;re not going to be good , you &apos;re good at the good .
So I went on .
My father was a member of the story of my father , and he said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re doing the <unk> of the ceremony , but I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; You know , we &apos;re doing the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to talk to you about the story of the story and the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of
What do I do with my company ? &quot; &quot; I was <unk> , and I went back to the 1980s , and I went to the 1950s from Beloit , Wisconsin .
And the year , the year , the number of people who are not there were only two years ago .
Nobody &apos;s ever met with the oil .
But it &apos;s been happening — the Exxon Valdez .
And I was the only man who said to the oil crisis in the U.S.
My father came up anyway .
He said , &quot; &quot; My son is using a lot of what this is , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t use a car , you can &apos;t get it .
He said , &quot; &quot; You need to teach you , because you have to get better , because you &apos;re doing better , you &apos;re doing better things , you &apos;re doing the <unk> .
And the way to get to the city , I was able to take the minaret back to the Atlantic , and that was seven years to get the Atlantic Ocean to the top of that , and we have to have a day for seven years .
I started to dig the Gulf around the valley , and I started to dig the bathroom from the bottom .
And so , because you &apos;re not going to see that , you know , when you &apos;re in the Gulf , you &apos;re not going to see that there &apos;s a man who &apos;s going to die , that &apos;s not the sound of a man who doesn &apos;t have to be .
And I was fascinated by my profession because I was afraid of my grandmother , and I was fascinated by my grandmother because they were angry .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
And they &apos;re not talking about the fact that they &apos;re not talking about their passion — they &apos;re me laughing .
And this is something that &apos;s the size of the time — it was a <unk> .
And so there &apos;s really important — we need to be able to get our egos out .
My job continued to work .
My father said , &quot; &quot; This is &quot; &quot; this <unk> , &quot; &quot; and yet I was a <unk> .
I was in the Coast of the Coast Coast of the Coast Coast of the Coast .
The problem for America is that we are in the middle of the country — the fact that the oil sector is the high of the <unk> of the oil sector .
20 years ago , if someone told me , &quot; &quot; John , you want to have a <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And if someone said , &quot; &quot; John , you want to have a <unk> ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; Yeah , I want to be a biologist . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Go back to the right , go ahead and go back to the right , go ahead and go back to the right . &quot; &quot; And then you &apos;re a little bit of a doctor , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m an <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to say , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m an <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m an <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m an <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m an <unk>
How is it that this is the way that you &apos;re able to ?
How can we be able to do simple things like <unk> and <unk> ?
The street from the Coast Coast Redwoods are the beautiful <unk> of the world .
And then — I was just a year — I was a lonely year — I was a year — I was a year ago , and I was going to get the entire Islands to get the whole Islands , to the extent to the extent that we &apos;ve had to go to the bathroom .
The key is the point of the question — I &apos;m going to tell you why I &apos;m going to tell you about what I &apos;m going to tell you about to tell you about what I &apos;m going to tell you about to tell you about what I &apos;m going to tell you about to tell you about what I &apos;m going to tell you about to tell you about what I &apos;m going to tell you about to tell you about what I &apos;m going to tell you about to tell you about what I &apos;m going
I started talking to the story of the <unk> environment .
And we had to have a living environment — not to be able to survive , but we had to be able to do it .
And the <unk> — the people who were not told about it , and we &apos;re not talking about people , and we &apos;re not afraid .
And not only because of the fact that we don &apos;t have the ability to memorize the environment , but not only because of the fact that we can &apos;t just see the universe , but not only because of the fact that we can &apos;t see our own existence , but not only because of the fact that we can &apos;t see our own existence , but not only because of the fact that we can &apos;t see our own existence .
And if we &apos;re all looking at the environment , we &apos;re all looking at the way we look at the people , and we &apos;re going to see that we &apos;re going to see the existence of the environment .
And that was the reason that I wanted to get to the point that I wanted to get to the point .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die of this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die of this thing , &quot; &quot; sitting in my head , and I was on my shoulders , and I was on my journey — and I started to get out of it — I was going to be my <unk> , and I started to work on it .
And the point of this story is that I &apos;ve been there , and I &apos;ve been there to just not see the number of people who are using it .
I &apos;ve been able to go through the El <unk> — my famous prison ceremony , and my prison prison — I didn &apos;t know , I had no idea what it was because I had no idea what it was because I had no idea what it was .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to die , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I said to him , &quot; &quot; Where are you ?
I didn &apos;t have to show you , I &apos;m not supposed to show you .
I was the GMT — doctors and I were looking at the world and I left the world .
What did I do with this ?
The way to the road is the way to go .
I can &apos;t get me to work .
What am I saying to my wife and I was a God , and I was a God ?
And I found that after 150 years of filming , I found that I was going to die , I was <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I found that I was going to get away from 150 kilometers .
I was a professor and I was a resident .
I was in my prison using my <unk> <unk> .
How can we be able to do it ?
Because at the moment I started using my voice , as I started to speak up at my time .
But the difference that I had was that I had no idea , I &apos;m not a woman , but I never had to use my own <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to be able to be able to go through the GMT .
Professor <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I figured , I just have another idea , I just have another side of my poem , and I was a misfit .
You know , we can do this .
I had to change my experience .
And because of the reason , they &apos;re always going to be able to get to be alive because they &apos;re always going to be afraid of being married .
Because the end of the end , the end of the end , was going to go to jail .
I knew who I was going to be able to do , I knew who I was going to be .
But I knew that it &apos;s necessary .
I knew that I was going to die . Because this is the only way I could go here .
And I know that we &apos;re always a place where we &apos;re always going to survive , but we have to live in places where we are always going to be .
And we &apos;re all about the ability to get to where we are , and we &apos;re all about to have new ecosystems where we are going to have new maps of the world .
And I want to be able to go back to where you &apos;re going to get to the next place — that &apos;s where you can get in your palm that you can &apos;t get in the palm of your palm , where you might have been so much more than that , that day , we have something on this road .
We &apos;re now .
As I said to the past , we must have known as the words of the past .
And if my self is an object , if my self is an object , and if my self is to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you about that .
And I know when I was here , I think , you can &apos;t see me .
So , if you &apos;re looking at the world — this is the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> — that &apos;s the <unk> — that &apos;s the <unk> — here &apos;s the TED time , where we &apos;re going to get to the world at TED .
Because the complexity of our environment is the ability to bind our environment into our environment , to the extent that we can interact with the environment .
So I &apos;d like to close my project to you , and I &apos;d like to close my project here .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .

And if you can imagine that in America , you can &apos;t imagine if you could imagine a <unk> , and ask the question , &quot; &quot; Are you going to die ?
And you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; This is the <unk> , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you call the <unk> .
This is the <unk> , and it says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the name ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the name of this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
