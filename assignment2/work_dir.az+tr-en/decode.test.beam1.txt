I &apos;m going to give you an unexpected concern today .
I &apos;m now the solar system and the solar rate .
And I think we can go through the little bit of the time , and we would go through the process and we would go it .
And we &apos;re going to look at different points of view .
This is just a little bit of a little bit of what we &apos;re doing .
ha , wait a minute .
It can &apos;t be a little bit of time .
( Laughter ) We just — I just — I &apos;m not — I &apos;m going to get the idea of my <unk> — I just ...
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) (
( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
Yeah . ( Laughter )
The Sun is <unk> .
Oh , the <unk> ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
So I want to focus on what I &apos;m going to do with my work .
And I &apos;ll come up with this , and hopefully , if you can , if you can get your body , you can get this very important change that you can &apos;t do with your body , which is that you can change the importance of it .
We &apos;re very optimistic about the language of the language , particularly though they can &apos;t even get the language of others .
We &apos;re going to be able to get away from different perspectives : ( Laughter ) — or you &apos;re talking about your experience or your voice , or you &apos;re going to be honest , or you &apos;re going to be able to do something that &apos;s simple .
<unk> : So they &apos;re going to get 10 cents a house .
These lucky police are <unk> in the U.S.
The moment is the headache — no . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
We &apos;re not . We &apos;re going to be able to do it .
They &apos;re not .
The man is <unk> for the man .
As you can see , it &apos;s also the same thing , and people are the same .
And the reason is that the story of the revolution and the transducer is the emergence of these experiences .
When we see our work , we often have to be afraid of the others of the other .
So , if someone is to us , the person is the force , the force of force to come up , the way that he was born , is that it &apos;s not the case .
In contrast , we are now in our hearts of his world .
What did I do that did that ?
I found that I could have noticed that there &apos;s lots of <unk> , lots of <unk> , <unk> .
Some of them are leaders , they &apos;re in the classroom , they &apos;re in the classroom , in the classroom , in the middle of the straight , in the middle of the straight , where they still have some place where teachers don &apos;t have a chance .
They &apos;re almost two of the things that are going to be able to go to two .
And the reason I &apos;m going to die is this <unk> .
They &apos;re not little <unk> .
And as they &apos;re sitting in the room , they &apos;re not going to be able to go through this .
I can &apos;t get a few points for myself for myself .
One is that you can &apos;t see it .
It &apos;s <unk> , which is , it &apos;s dependent on the scale .
So women are more than women who are more than women , they &apos;re <unk> .
The women are often more likely to feel more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be .
And the more and the <unk> are dependent on the circle of the <unk> .
And it &apos;s very important to get a MBA , because they &apos;re sensitive to their own well-being .
The unexpected time we have noticed that the law is always the struggle .
The women who are not going to have the same life and the women in the course of the course of the course , they get different from the course of the course of the course , and it seems to be connected to this .
I started thinking , I was able to think that I could be more optimistic that I could not be able to get rid of the work that was more than the sum of the things I &apos;ve ever had .
And if you could have these videos , they would have been able to get these videos of the way they can &apos;t get the same kind of thing ?
The fact that we were able to have a lot of real estate was really real .
So if you could have a quick chance of ourselves , that could make sense of ourselves more powerful than that could make us more powerful ?
We know that our gestures and the ideas we have about our ideas and the ideas we have is that we have a lot of variation and ideas .
But the question is , the question is , is that the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the gesture of the mood of these gestures and the ability to change and to change the way we can &apos;t do it .
But we &apos;re also in the process of the <unk> , and we &apos;re also looking at the future of our own destinies .
So this is what you &apos;ve been able to do in both of these things .
It &apos;s also also also in the way that we can &apos;t see .
We are strong and understanding that we are strong , and they are very strong , and they &apos;re very strong , but they &apos;re powerful to be stronger than we can &apos;t be .
We have not known as we know that we know that we know that we &apos;re not going to be able to get the enemy , but we &apos;re not going to be able to get the <unk> of the <unk> .
I think that feeling of feeling is a sense of how I think I can &apos;t think about the scale of the concept ?
The idea and the idea is that they can &apos;t be afraid of them , they &apos;re not going to be afraid of them , and to me , it &apos;s my fault . I &apos;m going to get it .
What &apos;s the way we get to the Gulf &apos;s <unk> ?
It &apos;s not the reason that we &apos;re very often strong .
You know , you &apos;re not going to see them . &quot; &quot; And you know , &quot; &quot; You know .
And we have a choice that we can teach them to share and teach them .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the thing that &apos;s happened is 60 percent of the people who are not , and that &apos;s because they &apos;re not enough significant .
This is the <unk> .
When we hear the moment we &apos;ve been asking , they &apos;re going to get 20 percent of the time , and they &apos;re going to get 10 percent of the time , and they &apos;re going to get 10 percent of the time .
And two generations of the two things are going to be on their own .
And what happened is that the moment that we &apos;re wrong with the question is : These are the people who are facing the headache .
<unk> percent of the time we &apos;ve been able to get rid of the population of the day is to increase the growth of 15 percent , and they &apos;re going to get 15 percent of the time .
The two moments that we see are the freedoms that our brains are capable of , understanding that our brains are more ambitious , understanding and comfortable and comfortable , and you &apos;re going to have to be afraid of you .
This is <unk> <unk> , right ?
So , our <unk> language is how you feel about our language and you feel like , you know , you &apos;re not alone for the rest of the time .
They change the way they &apos;re doing other things .
And the next question is , if you &apos;re looking at a few <unk> , you can &apos;t really understand that they &apos;re important to make that important , which is that we can &apos;t change the way that we &apos;re able to do that .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What &apos;s the real world in real life ?
Well , that &apos;s the main reason that we &apos;re all about .
<unk> , this is the <unk> of the <unk> that makes a lot of social functions .
Where are you going to be able to live ?
And so this is a <unk> table for the future .
For those who are others , they &apos;re not going to be working on this high school .
They &apos;re not going to be able to do it in this way or in this way , or work .
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with the work of the <unk> business in the <unk> , because it &apos;s like the <unk> .
So we &apos;ve been able to get the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> : &quot; &quot; Are we doing that ?
( Laughter ) Of course , we did this idea . No ! No ! Of course , we don &apos;t know .
I can &apos;t go like this .
This is not a whole thing .
It &apos;s because it &apos;s about to be a <unk> .
What do you do when you get to the point ?
You sit down . They &apos;re going to be <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which is what you should have to do , which is , is that , you know , it &apos;s going to be a good moment , like you &apos;re sitting in .
That was what we wanted to be .
And the reason we can &apos;t go back is to change the way that we &apos;re going to change , and then you can &apos;t get a lot of work , and then you &apos;re going to get a lot of <unk> work .
I was a video of a couple of <unk> interviews .
They &apos;re using the tools to use their <unk> to make sure that they can &apos;t use their money to do anything to do with their own <unk> .
<unk> are more than five minutes of being able to speak to the moment that we &apos;re facing .
Nobody &apos;s ever got it .
The <unk> will be called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; It increases the productivity of the <unk> .
We &apos;re not going to be able to see them as well as they can &apos;t see .
Then we were flying these <unk> flying .
I was able to get my friends from my parents .
They were able to get to know who they were , and they said , &quot; &quot; We want to go through this , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;ll go away from the top , and they &apos;ll get the people who bought the high force .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get the idea to work .
And the more we get to the extent . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the impact that we &apos;re able to do ?
This is not why they &apos;re not .
They &apos;re connected by their own partners .
And I &apos;ll look at them as well as other worlds , and so , how much would you ever get to the supermarket ?
Do we have the <unk> ?
This was not the difference in the world .
The key thing is that they &apos;re not really interested .
People are not only <unk> real estate .
So they &apos;re not going to be able to get the barrier .
They &apos;re not a <unk> , they &apos;re not known as they can .
The way that I &apos;m fascinated by this is that it affects the environment .
And when I say to people , you know , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; this is not a little bit of <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not a little bit of <unk> ?
I &apos;m like , I &apos;m a little bit tired of what I &apos;m going to call my grandmother .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not .
You can &apos;t hear anything you can &apos;t do .
They &apos;re not going to be a <unk> .
They &apos;re not known to me .
I &apos;m going to get this words very well . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to tell you a little story about my journey and I want to tell you a little bit about the feeling of my space .
At the age of 19 , I was very heavy at the very heavy anxiety of the very heavy anxiety .
The streets were coming out .
They &apos;re not going to be a couple of times .
I had to go to the bathroom , I became a <unk> , and I became the news that I was going to go to the bathroom , and I was able to get it to the Pole , and I was very painful , and it was very painful for me to do it .
I was a professor of <unk> , because I was clever , and I was afraid of a young boy .
I decided to go back to my office , to my work .
They came to me : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be thinking about the things that are wrong with the things that are not the people who are not in the world , but they &apos;re not the only thing that you have to do with it , and I &apos;ve started to say that , to me , the main thing you have is that it &apos;s the same thing that you have to do , that &apos;s what you can &apos;t do with it .
I was a total vulnerable feeling .
I was able to work , I decided , I would have been able to work with my own , and I would have been to the success of the success of the success .
So I finished the conductor .
I had to go back four years of my life four years , and I &apos;ve been saying , when I was a member of the <unk> , I &apos;ve been willing to do something I &apos;ve been willing to do with my wife , and I was trying to do it .
I was a professor .
I was 20 years old , 20 years ago , when I was 20 years old , I was <unk> 20 years ago .
He was waiting for the night .
I was so happy to say that in the morning , I was going to call the <unk> call , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; He told me : &quot; No , you &apos;re wrong , you &apos;re going to get your experience from your heart .
I think it &apos;s because they &apos;re going to be able to get bored and die .
And it &apos;s even a <unk> .
You &apos;re all excited about all the things you &apos;re wearing .
And the way we started to change , again , was the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
I &apos;m really afraid of , I &apos;m not going to be afraid . &quot; &quot; And I did it .
I &apos;ve been able to spend a lot of time in the high school years , and I &apos;ve been able to go high school for a few years that was , in fact , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , there &apos;s no reason for this , but I was thinking , &quot; &quot; This is my place .
I was a professor at the end of the first year , and I was a sophomore , and I was saying , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to get a meeting in my school , or you &apos;re going to die . &quot; &quot; And I was a <unk> , and I was a good kid .
He &apos;s got a <unk> <unk> , he said , &quot; &quot; This is my place .
This is a return of me .
Because two things happened .
The first one I realized was that I was going to die .
But he felt that he was smiling and he was shooting .
The second is that he had to be able to figure out what it was .
So he could have saved the ship and the translator .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not just <unk> , right !
It &apos;s the essence of the self that &apos;s going to be the essence of the self , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be the best <unk> ever since , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be the best fan of the <unk> . &quot; &quot; He was like , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s , &quot; &quot; he was there , he was there , he was there , and he was there , and he was his eyes , and he was his dream , not until
It was <unk> .
And I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that , I would like to tell you that , I would
You can get it as a matter of matter .
I was just like , until one of the things that we were in the Gulf of the closet .
I think it &apos;s my grandfather .
It can be a large <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s two minutes ago .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
So , next time you &apos;re a couple of hours ago , I &apos;ll try and try and do this , and I &apos;m going to get a <unk> , a cockroach , or a <unk> , or a <unk> .
Get rid of your work .
The best way to get to the future is to be the ones that are the best way .
<unk> . <unk> .
I didn &apos;t have to show what I was telling them , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have to show them what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I didn &apos;t think that we can &apos;t even let them go .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m telling them who I am , and I &apos;ll tell them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die .
I &apos;m thinking I &apos;m thinking about the force of using these forces , and I &apos;m going to be able to use it for the reason , because it &apos;s very frustrating .
It &apos;s not a <unk> . ( Laughter ) This is the theme of these guys and people , because people who can &apos;t help us , because people are like , &quot; &quot; People who are so excited about it , and they &apos;re not with the same , and they &apos;re the people who are not .
I can &apos;t use it with them , which is that we can use my own money .
Because the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the focus of two <unk> , which is because it makes it very valuable .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have very much of the world .
And the most important thing is that they &apos;re not the most important part of their civilization .
It &apos;s like the <unk> , they &apos;re in the sense that they can &apos;t get through the crowd , they &apos;re going to get through the crowd .
The <unk> of the <unk> system has made up the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of pressure , honest , honest , and they &apos;re going to be a full-time , honest , necessary , but you &apos;re not just thanked .
Here , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the 90 percent of the <unk> .
Most of the time , the human eye is a <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to have some of the reasons that I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;m going to get some of the things that I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;m going to get to the middle of the supermarket and you &apos;re going to get a little bit of a wobble , or you &apos;re going to get a little bit of a wobble in the middle of the closet .
And this is why I had a very good idea of the way that I had to do with this .
I &apos;m a doctor and I &apos;m not a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to get rid of the social , social , bottom-up , bottom-up society .
In 1908 , I was able to go through my workshop and unveil my job of my work , my <unk> , my <unk> .
But this time you can &apos;t see the whole thing .
The art of art and the fact that I was able to do more and more and more and more and more and more , and that was helped to increase their interests .
And those days they were able to get the work of their work and their social capital .
I think that &apos;s the reason that we &apos;ve been able to do this with this world , and this is all the time we &apos;ve been here with this world .
I was invited to be a very senior student , and I was invited to be a very elitist and <unk> world in a very long city .
I came to my community that I was not just saying that they &apos;re not just alive .
I have been in the country , I have been in southern Africa , in South Africa , in Africa , in southern Africa , in Africa .
I understood that I was going to get more people that I could have been able to do , because this was a big job .
And then I was a <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter ) — I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , I was a big believer in the organization , and the purpose of the organization , and the purpose of the organization , was a huge <unk> .
I was born with the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and that was by the very famous honor and health .
Also , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , was given to the security of the safety , and the fact that they can &apos;t tell them , they &apos;re given the safety of security , and they &apos;re given to the story of the story .
I think it &apos;s a different way to go , to the extent to my life : the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> .
And lastly , I was born by the <unk> of the <unk> , and the great part of the world is that we &apos;re going to be part of the big part of the world .
In Sao Paulo , &quot; &quot; São Paulo , &quot; &quot; and I was <unk> in Sao Paulo .
But the fact that we &apos;ve been talking about TEDx is a <unk> , and a TEDx woman , which is the <unk> , which was <unk> by the <unk> , was <unk> by the <unk> , who was <unk> by the <unk> .
So , we &apos;re going to get to everybody &apos;s wishes .
In two years , there were 170 <unk> , 800 <unk> , and we were going to die 200 <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be able to go back to the local community , and we &apos;re going to have to be able to go back to the local community .
No , no , the people who are not the honor of the <unk> and the people who are worthy of the honor and worthy of the people who are not .
You can see that the reason you &apos;re born with the enemy is that you can &apos;t see the limitations of the time , and you can &apos;t get the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , we &apos;re going to show you the fact that we can &apos;t see and see the other invisible telescopes and we &apos;re going to see them .
Try to see a whole lot of things , without the <unk> and <unk> .
No , no , there &apos;s no reason , there &apos;s a lot of people in the world .
And so I can &apos;t tell him that when you &apos;re a part of the world , you &apos;re not going to be able to get them from the point of view .
I &apos;m not talking about your work , thank you .
( Applause )
Five to five years , in the 1908 , <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the 1908 , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They were all about the first time that I was going to die , but I was a meeting in a meeting with the other <unk> , but I was a meeting with the other <unk> that was <unk> at the time , and the <unk> plans that was <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But I think it &apos;s the reason that we can &apos;t get the Earth from the World Bank , the World Bank , the Earth in 1908 .
The Maasais &apos; <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to be daunted by my grandmother .
In 1908 , Pennsylvania , the Pennsylvania , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , to me , to be able to get to the world .
And when I was in my age , I started to get the <unk> from the <unk> .
My father had been told me that Islam was a very few people who get to a lot of <unk> .
And the thing I found out is that people who are not enough , and they &apos;re not really good at all , and we &apos;re actually not going to be able to understand that every one of us is the same as we can &apos;t do , but we &apos;re not going to be able to get a long time .
Every single one of the time , every single one of the time , is to go to the people who are fighting for a lot of their own , and we have to have a lot of them , and they &apos;re not going to be able to go to any other person , to be able to keep the enemy .
My father just came to me with my father a couple of months ago with my father , with my father , with a couple of weeks ago with my father , with a couple of weeks ago with my grandfather &apos;s license .
I was going to be able to get him to him in the morning .
We were able to put the pointer of the bubble . &quot; &quot; So we didn &apos;t know that there was a secret that was hidden in the front of the door .
My father told me that my father had been able to get angry at me and started to figure out how to get the kiss from 30 years old , and how they started to get 30 years old .
So the last pine <unk> came out of the last orange orange paper on the last pine hotel , and it was the end of that , and I &apos;m not going to end up .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die in the other side of the time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot;
And they &apos;re all laughed at this , but in a few years , I knew what they were doing after a couple years .
They were also <unk> , and I was a <unk> <unk> .
These people are <unk> by the fact that they &apos;ve been trained to get around 700 pounds of light , and they &apos;re going to be able to tell the story of the Earth &apos;s population , and the fact that we can &apos;t see the number of these underground <unk> , the <unk> of the underworld , the <unk> of the underworld , the <unk> of the population .
And this is the people who never had to do .
&quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; — people who I call <unk> .
I was about 20 years old , and I had to be amazed by 20 times as I was 19 years old , and I had to be treated with these identities .
I would have a very much more sense of my time when I was walking my eyes , and I would have a very much saner idea .
And the time I think about the time , I think , is a new , young boy , a little bit of time .
The classroom to be in the classroom was hidden in the classroom , to be hidden in the classroom , but it was a clear point that was , it was the greatest flier in the world , and it was the fact that he was the greatest part of the world .
So I &apos;m going to be in a very long way , so when you read a book , you &apos;re going to read a book , or you &apos;re going to play games .
So , I &apos;ve got the opportunity to communicate this , to the extent that I had to be a very supportive , who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was not going to be the real thing .
I grew up with a <unk> organization that was not only random , and I grew up with a <unk> , and I grew up with a <unk> .
What led to ?
And one of my first <unk> drawings of me was to be able to go to the very first one of the first time in 2000 , in 2000 .
<unk> <unk> software <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was a group of students that I had to call the band , and I was a very privileged part of the time , and I was a very privileged one , as I was talking about the kids , and I was the only one who I had to do with my parents .
The way I &apos;ve seen in the wild , the different path of life .
I found that I was a senior in the last night of my last night , a Jewish family .
I was convinced that this was a couple of years ago , but I realized that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be afraid of the fact that there was no way to fit in .
I remember a young man who was Jewish in Hebrew , and my grandmother , my friend , was told me that my grandfather had been rejected by me , and I was afraid of the fact that I could not be afraid of the truth .
And the thing I &apos;ve been thinking about is that , in fact , I find a job that I could have found a little more important task in the way I &apos;m going to get in the Gulf of Education .
And I was in the field of various people here , and this experience of the people who are in the field , and this experience of experience of the building that was happening in the course of the past .
I think that the majority of our lives are the ones that are not the only <unk> , and the fact that they have had the ability to be born with the destruction of the whole community .
So , it &apos;s like business , which is the way I &apos;ve been trying to work in one of the most gay teachers , and I &apos;ve seen that in the way I &apos;ve been talking about them , and I think they &apos;re very likely to be very often the least <unk> people in the world .
I was a sad person . My story was a very young man who was a very young man who was a girl who was a girl who was a girl who was a girl who was a woman who had a chance to get married and to myself .
And the way I &apos;ve been talking about this is that the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> to me with real life .
We don &apos;t know how to be a <unk> , but because of the fact that we don &apos;t have a lot of trouble with the ignorance of the <unk> , it &apos;s very good .
Then he became honest , &quot; &quot; The <unk> Show . &quot; &quot; John Doe had brought to me to be honest , and he made me honest , and he was helping me realize that the religious and sexual violence were not the first time that he had ever had .
I mean , I &apos;m a fluke , a woman who &apos;s really hard to get me in moments of my life , and I &apos;m not going to get it .
And my inspirations were very often from the spirit of my <unk> , and in the tradition of meeting , in the world , the world &apos;s dilemma is not a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
A day , I had a meeting on my head of the world , and my mother had been told by the fact that my mother had been told me to be a promise to my life .
My mother had been so much of her as she had enough hair , and he said , &quot; &quot; I hate to love the people who have been long enough for life to hate my mother .
I understood how much energy they hate in a <unk> crash , which I hated .
My <unk> is not my real name .
The Maasais &apos; <unk> , when we started to start with the new life , we would have been able to begin to begin with the next generation of the world .
Why don &apos;t you expose it to the end of the time , and you can &apos;t tell it if you could have to be rejected ?
They &apos;re very repetitive .
And I &apos;m going to get that insight that I &apos;m going to do , which is , maybe , maybe someone who &apos;s probably not going to be a bit of a bit of the way , and I &apos;m amazed at the fact that I was going to be amazed , I &apos;m not at the end of my day , I &apos;m not at the pole , I &apos;m not at the Packard .
We can &apos;t use the freedoms , the <unk> of our life , the <unk> of our life , and the fight against the violence .
I &apos;m going to spend that time and I &apos;m going to get them to them , and I &apos;m not going to get the terrible fortune of being the bitter traffickers and the rest of them .
I &apos;m going to be able to go through the book of the book , and I &apos;m going to go through the book of my head , and I &apos;m going to be able to go through the box of my <unk> .
As simple as possible , I &apos;m living in the live room , and I &apos;m living in the live room and the way we &apos;re going to get the same thing out of the road .
I &apos;m not like my dad .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Every time I &apos;m not . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
<unk> of all .
Can you see ?
And they were going to step on the steps , but I wanted to be honest , and somebody &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; Arabic &quot; &quot; on the name of a <unk> , where someone &apos;s writing their own ?
Somebody &apos;s writing ? Anybody ? Well , the problem is .
I was a while ago , I was a restaurant in the restaurant , and I was reading the food .
I was a doctor , and I said , &quot; Are there a <unk> ? &quot;
He &apos;s not a poet , he &apos;s funny , he &apos;s funny me .
He said , &quot; &quot; Are you saying , &quot; &quot; Are you saying , &quot; &quot; Are you saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the thing to do with your boss ? &quot; &quot; And I know what ?
He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And &quot; &quot; French <unk> &quot; &quot; or &quot; French <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wrong , you &apos;re going to be doing that .
He was crying in the closet , and he said , &quot; &quot; If you were the youngest of the world , I &apos;m going to get it away from the top of that , I &apos;m going to get it up . &quot;
What &apos;s the question of &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; eureka , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
He said that when I was young , she was like the young boy who was born in the village , and he was afraid of the grandmother as a rabbi .
Can we go to this kind of waiting ?
So now I started thinking .
This is my <unk> .
This is a really <unk> guy .
They &apos;re not going to be told by their own egos , their own faith .
Is this a chance of going to be another ?
How do we get here ?
But there &apos;s a lot of men here , like me , who are telling us that they were just a little bit of a sense of what was happening to me that I could only tell you about modern and cultural spirits to be able to get to the rest of the world .
I &apos;m all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ?
The question is , could be our best possible flute players .
I just can &apos;t just tell you anything I learned in Arabic .
Would you be willing to be somebody who is one of them ?
Can you get the <unk> ?
And yet , I decided to get it to the time I was able to deal with it .
I was able to make it from my <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
The Arab language is the answer to the Arab .
It &apos;s not as well as the language of science , or the language of the <unk> , or our <unk> business in our business business , and that &apos;s not the language of the <unk> , and that &apos;s not the language that we use in the air .
If you &apos;re in , they &apos;re not going to be our own .
And how do I use the skeleton of the marathon ? We all ask the answer !
You &apos;re in the Arab language , and we are using the Arabic <unk> ?
This is a <unk> .
But there &apos;s another reality that we are in our brains .
Arabic language is the main element .
The reason we call it is that we &apos;re very proud of the other word to be perfect in the English language .
They &apos;re not going to be able to express other things in Arabic , in Arabic .
How ?
When I first started writing , I started to use Arabic <unk> in Arabic .
I think it &apos;s the kind of thing that was the whole idea of all of the ideas , and the special sound , the special , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
So when I started writing his article , he was his long time .
In fact , that &apos;s when you hear his handwriting from his writings , you know , you &apos;re in the English room , that you &apos;re going to die .
You can imagine , you can imagine , in English , in English , that you can &apos;t get in English .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
The second is that we &apos;re going to say , if you &apos;re a <unk> , the only way to get rid of your life is the only way to get his tongue out of the tongue .
This is a <unk> that was developed by the way .
The Germans , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> — this is the <unk> .
And so they &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of their own lives .
They &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
So they can use it to use a lot of money to do the language of the language , which is a lot of money .
Are we more aware of them ?
Well , we don &apos;t know the world &apos;s world , and we &apos;re not trying to come up with the idea of the cultural world , and we &apos;re going to be able to speak in cultural world .
Once upon a time , we &apos;re not going to be able to get to improve the lives of the people who are not , but they &apos;re not going to be able to get the diversity of the time , and they &apos;re not talking about the fact that they &apos;re not going to be able to share their lives , like , like , <unk> , and they &apos;re not afraid of it .
They are the language they can &apos;t be able to make language .
Because if you &apos;re a product or a product , a person &apos;s or a product in the Latin , and you &apos;re in the Latin Wall , it &apos;s not the local product .
You can &apos;t get it with the local product .
They were the <unk> of the <unk> , the purchaser , as we were in the morning .
So they became the tools and they became their own way to innovate .
If I say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , what are you doing ?
Have you ever been doing anything , right ?
Who and why .
Language is not just a tool for the future , but it &apos;s not just a tool for speech .
Language is our ability to look at our brains and our ability to interact with our own destinies .
So , when we say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , we &apos;re going to ask , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , we &apos;re going to die , there &apos;s a special image of every one of you in a special history of history .
It &apos;s not a language or two or three , or three words .
It &apos;s how we can &apos;t tell how we can read , how we can &apos;t read , how they can &apos;t be used to , in fact , the adult .
What &apos;s the question ?
How can you tell the human truth , or not ?
So if you say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; The father , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; Dad , you know , are you in the Bible ?
What do you feel ?
If you &apos;re wrong , you &apos;re good , and I &apos;m going to get to the middle of the supermarket and you &apos;re going to get empty .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with these guys .
I have a friend who &apos;s married to me with a married partner .
And I said , how do things go to work ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is good . &quot; &quot; But I was a meeting every day , and I was saying , &quot; &quot; Everything is good . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The woman who was not the woman who was saying , &quot; &quot; The woman , &quot; &quot; and then , &quot; &quot; The woman , &quot; &quot; and then I &apos;ll try to explain it all the word .
He said that he was going to be able to get the idea of how much of the human beings could be ?
Who &apos;s to have suicide ?
&quot; &quot; <unk> me ? &quot; &quot; This is one of a few generations .
We started thinking , because I was thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a woman , &quot; &quot; and I was afraid to tell him that the woman , she was telling him that she was going to get her idea .
My friend told me , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s a Christmas of me , and I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been doing this for me , and I thought I &apos;d like to say that when I &apos;m going to die , I &apos;ll feel that you can &apos;t feel that when I &apos;m born , and I &apos;ll go back . &quot; &quot; And the woman , for him , is a &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get away from them . &quot; &quot; And this woman , the man , I was back to
So , you can imagine this .
( Applause ) So , what do we do to protect the Arabic language ?
We &apos;re going to be able to do this with the <unk> of the <unk> , and we can &apos;t tell the Arabic to protect the Arab language .
And so , a lot of people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why is you freaking ?
This is the story of the story and the point for the matter . &quot; &quot; The problem is .
This was the word &quot; Arabic language Forum &quot; &quot; which was &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and you know , I &apos;m going to ask me to answer the answer . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to ask you to ask me if I &apos;m a professor of mine , you can &apos;t answer . &quot;
We &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; No . We &apos;re going to be doing that , or we &apos;ll be able to accept it . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to get rid of us in this way .
And if someone says that I &apos;m going to get to the Arab world , I hate the Arabic .
We are grateful that we can change our lives , and we &apos;re going to be able to change our lives , and we &apos;re going to be able to see that we can &apos;t be able to change our lives .
We are our hearts of our lives , and we &apos;re going to be able to go through our generation .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die of my servant , but you &apos;d have a poll answer , but you &apos;d have a meeting .
Very simple , very simple , creative and understandable .
And then we started to see a different story on the <unk> of the <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen this <unk> , you &apos;ve seen a lot of people on the bus , and you &apos;ve got to see the <unk> on the top of the yellow line .
Why ? Well , I &apos;m really a doctor .
We can also be our language .
If we &apos;re on our language , we &apos;re going to get rid of the <unk> .
We &apos;re not going to be able to get the championship .
We &apos;re going to get rid of the rest of the world .
This is a very serious chance of our time , our chances of modern and cultural age .
And then we were able to get the Arab village from the village to boys and girls in the Arab world .
They &apos;re not going to be afraid of girls and girls .
We &apos;re very much like &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — we &apos;re very much like , &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — we &apos;re very much like , &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — we &apos;re very much like , &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — we &apos;re very much like , &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — we &apos;re very much
And who says , &quot; &quot; Aha , you &apos;re like &quot; &quot; Aha , you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; Ah , you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m a little more confident , but let me tell me , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Give me a better phrase that I could be wrong with .
I &apos;m going to go to the website &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; — I &apos;m a &quot; &quot; The Internet of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s because we &apos;re in the world , we &apos;re going to change ourselves .
But as we &apos;re talking about this , we &apos;re not known as if it &apos;s a problem , if we don &apos;t know , we &apos;re going to change the problem , we don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to have bigger people , that we can go to control and tell us that we can &apos;t tell us that , you know , that we &apos;re going to get to the point of the world and you &apos;re going to get to the point of what we &apos;re going to do .
They &apos;re not going to be a <unk> .
If we can go to the universe and go down the stage , or on the front lines , and so we can be creative .
So what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re a creative learner , and you &apos;re doing it .
It &apos;s a way of your own story of the fundamental thing .
Let &apos;s ask if we are .
Let &apos;s tell you , &quot; &quot; Hey , you &apos;re a novel or a short movie .
And the doctor doesn &apos;t make us global .
It can lead to a cause that can lead to the Arab language .
I mean , there &apos;s no way to say , &quot; &quot; No way , no way , &quot; &quot; is flat .
But we are in the middle and we &apos;re afraid , and we have the road to be a part of the way that we &apos;re going to get a part of that way .
So , what can you do this day ?
Who are you doing ?
I &apos;m also asking you to be a very optimistic , very , very <unk> English , or a Chinese in a Chinese style .
But I was talking about the culture of the Arabic culture , which I felt mixed in Arabic .
( Applause ) This is a <unk> ! This is not language .
You can get into the world with your friends .
It &apos;s not easy to get away from a soul that can &apos;t come back to a soul .
This is what we &apos;re all doing .
The second , there &apos;s lots of other things we can do .
We &apos;re going to be able to get here this day to be able to get the work here .
We &apos;re not saying that &apos;s the language of the language of the language of this language .
Now , I &apos;m a biologist , and I &apos;m a biologist .
The first time you &apos;re born with the first time you &apos;re able to share their own language through language .
My father , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to die , you know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; This is my &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Applause ) Now , if you &apos;re in the cultural circle , you &apos;re going to get ourselves in this cultural circle . ( Applause )
A few years ago , the U.S. American <unk> was the following , the U.S.
I found a couple of things , I found a couple of things , I found a couple of things .
And instead of all around the world , I was more likely to be more than the more of the time .
I &apos;ve been a little bit of a picture for me in a month , for a month .
I can begin to go back to 30 days .
I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that , I also found that
And by the way , this is the words of the day that you can &apos;t do that , by the way , the way they get to sleep at daily prices .
But I &apos;m not going to write novel .
It &apos;s very much fun .
I didn &apos;t have to be a <unk> .
No , if you &apos;re not , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a misfit . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a misfit . &quot; &quot; No , if I &apos;m a biologist , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a misfit . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not .
And I found that little , and I could not have enough , and I was very interested in the fact that I could have been able to do it , and that was the possibility to be a story that was happening .
Actually , they &apos;re very repetitive .
( Applause )
The first day I started with my experience full day and <unk> and <unk> .
I started to be good at the very good moment , and I started talking about the fact that I could read a lot of the time , and I started talking about the fact that I could be talking about the fact that I could be talking about the fact that I &apos;m talking about the fact that I &apos;m talking about the fact that I &apos;m talking about the fact that I &apos;m talking about the fact that I &apos;m talking about the fact that I &apos;m going to be a student with a teacher .
And the student who &apos;s been trained in this very humbling , high-volume , <unk> student , was actually a great picture .
And I think that I &apos;m very proud of myself , and I feel like I &apos;m going to get my friends , I &apos;m afraid of men , and I &apos;m going to get the same guys that I &apos;m going to call my grandmother .
But this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
The reason that I was so convincing that my grandfather was so convincing , I was not even able to predict my first day , and when I started to dive , when I started my first visit , I was going to be able to predict the first one .
As I &apos;m looking at the headlines , I was like , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk about the fact that I &apos;m going to have been , &quot; &quot; when the room left , the guy left the room , the guy left the room , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s going to go to the kitchen . &quot; &quot; And I was <unk> , and I &apos;m going to go to the next door .
No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
And if you &apos;re in the mind , I think that &apos;s what we call the <unk> of <unk> .
&quot; &quot; It &apos;s <unk> . &quot; &quot; — I &apos;m wrong .
This was a dawn of dawn .
And I was born , and I was amazed , and I was amazed to see everything that was going to be my third hand .
&quot; It &apos;s going to go . &quot;
I was angry , and I was a little bit bored and I was going to die and I &apos;m going to die and I &apos;m going to be able to do it , and I also think that the sound is the ability to get rid of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
For example , for example , the Bible is like the poets I &apos;m concerned about , and the time I &apos;m not the only <unk> of the truth .
I was feeling no more worried , but I was afraid of my life , but I was afraid of the fact that I was going to be able to find my life , and I was afraid of the fact that I had to be afraid of the fact that I had a lot of fun , and I was afraid of my life .
And I had an honor of my grandfather and he came to the synagogue .
And the reason I &apos;ve been doing this is that we had to have a lot of fun , and they were a serious <unk> , and it was a serious story .
The sound of the sound is starting to be a little bit of a <unk> , and he blew my mind , which he was doing , and I was able to go back to the second largest of the second two of the most amazing people , and I gave the second largest of the second largest <unk> path of the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get rid of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I saw my baby <unk> , and I saw my voice , and I saw my voice , and I saw my voice , and I saw my baby <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I needed this curiosity and I needed my support , and I started talking about my journey about the fact that I could not be told .
And he said , &quot; &quot; My voice is at that moment .
And I think that the way we get to the ceremony is that they look like a nasty , bad way to get the word that I said , &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s what I said to you .
For example , I was working on students who were talking about the fact that I was talking about , and I was talking about the fact that student in the late 1990s , I was saying , &quot; &quot; I want you to be fired , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to be a kid .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get the news . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die .
And the answer started to get out of the course of the second fast .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , one of the most exciting : I was a <unk> , and the feeling of the spirit of my anger and the feeling of the spirit .
It started to be the fact that the reason that we were missing was not the <unk> , but it started to be the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> .
This was the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the number of the <unk> , and the number of times , the number of drivers and the <unk> and the <unk> .
I was a similar animal , and I was able to get a similar animal to the <unk> of the <unk> , and the sounds of this world is also a little bit of a <unk> .
For example , if you were to see that I was a <unk> <unk> , I was able to see that I was able to see that I was able to see that I was a <unk> , and so it was like , and it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , you know , like , you know , like , you &apos;re going to get these kinds of things out of the same kind of stuff .
So I &apos;ve been able to see the first time that I &apos;ve been around three decades , like three to three , three , many more , and particularly , and particularly , in the case , were given the dramatic <unk> , and particularly in the dramatic centuries .
Where are the water that &apos;s flooded with the water ?
No , he <unk> the water on the hospital , &quot; &quot; I was writing that water on the Internet , and it &apos;s obvious that it &apos;s in the middle of it .
Eventually , the images of my <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , was the <unk> of the <unk> , and I was forced to create my role .
Two years later , I started with my grandfather .
I was aware of all the time I was born , and the secret sounds , and the strange , awkward , confusion , was the opposite of the deal .
And the reason I was saying is that the <unk> , the <unk> , the physical , was a <unk> , and the teacher told me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get it wrong with you . &quot; &quot; And he was <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong with the <unk> , &quot; &quot; he was a physicist , and he was so proud of the <unk> , and I was so disappointed that I was so proud of them , I wanted to tell them I was going to be afraid
Now , I think that &apos;s the reason that you &apos;re going to die , and you &apos;re looking at the fact that you &apos;re going to die , and you &apos;re going to have a lot of it , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
I was able to get a <unk> and a <unk> , and I was able to get the right to the right , and I &apos;ll be able to get the right to the right , and I &apos;ll finally get the <unk> of the <unk> .
Many people have been wasted , and they &apos;re not all about their people , and they &apos;re all afraid , but this is very weak and very poor people who are willing to help me .
And I was amazed for me , and I was able to get married , and I would have been willing to get to the rest of the time , and I &apos;d never been able to get to the ward , and I &apos;d been ready to get to the point of this , and I &apos;d been ready for this to be a very brief moment , and I &apos;ve been willing to have this , and I &apos;ve been talking to me about the greatest concerning , the most concerning , the most concerning , the
And I think , when it turns out , it &apos;s going to be solved .
Sometimes , when you &apos;re afraid of the spirit , the absolute spring comes , and the absolute spring comes , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk . I &apos;m 14 years old , and I &apos;m going to fight for me to come back to me and to be told that we &apos;re going to get back to me , and we &apos;re not going to be able to get this beautiful people to tell you that this beautiful person is going to be a good person to do with the rest of the world .
But they were able to get the courage to get the courage to get the courage , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
I would argue that I could ask , to ask me to save me , to be able to get to know that we could have been able to get married , and the most fundamental thing , the most important thing , the most important thing , the most important thing , the most important thing , the most important thing , I realized that I could have been able to deal with the miracle of the <unk> , and the most fundamental thing , not the <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk>
Of course , I was able to make pictures of my previous sound and the fact that I was able to do it , and so I was really interested in making it very clear to me , and I was really amazed to realize that I was a very privileged step .
For example , for example , I found myself talking about the coffee lines , and I found that I had found that the real , not as much as the real and <unk> sense of the truth , and the feeling of the truth and the feeling of the truth and the feeling of the truth .
I used to be told .
I &apos;m not going to be able to hear that night , and I &apos;m going to hear that I &apos;m going to be able to hear them , to keep them up , to keep them in real real estate .
I was a lot of <unk> , and I was able to go through a lot of my work , and I &apos;m going to get a lot of money , and I &apos;m going to hear that , you know , you &apos;re going to hear a little bit of a sad thing , and I &apos;m going to get a little bit of it , something a sad joke , and I &apos;m going to hear a little bit of bad , something a little bit like a joke , and I &apos;m going to hear that
So , like , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t work .
I was a little bit like a plastic bag-free ? &quot; &quot; This was the story .
I was a little bit more like my wife &apos;s dilemma , and I was more important than I was talking about , &quot; &quot; I was a bit more important than I was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sorry , &quot; &quot; I was sorry , because I was trying to thank them , because I was trying to realize how much I had ever been doing , and I was trying to thank them , because I was trying to realize that I was a real time , and I was a recovering learner ,
I started to ask them , and I started to ask them , but I started to answer the question , but I started to answer the question , which is , in fact , I started to understand the story of the relationship between the people who are learning to learn how to communicate and learn to understand the future .
I found all of this stuff that was all about , and I found that I could have been able to solve the people who were going to be able to solve the work , and I found that I could not have been solved , and I found that I could have found that the people who are not going to solve the work , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk>
And when I was born , he was able to get this wounds and had to start with the fact that my grandfather had gotten to be a very good thing , and that was the fact that I was the most convinced that I was the most convinced that I had to be the most compassionate and <unk> that was needed to be the most compassionate and <unk> that was needed to be the most compassionate and <unk> that was needed .
And after all , I was amazed that I was able to get it from the top of the <unk> , and I was able to get the <unk> of the <unk> , and this time , okay , I &apos;m going to get away from the rest of the world .
The first time you were the voice of the sound , 10 years later , was the largest <unk> <unk> in the history of the 20th century , and I became a year later — I got the highest number of <unk> .
One of the reasons I was born was my grandfather to me when I was a kid .
The truth is , the truth is , they &apos;re not making sure they &apos;re going to be able to make their work .
As I said to my grandmother , as I said , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m afraid of my grandmother , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;ll be afraid of the word &quot; &quot; atheist &quot; &quot; — as he said , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot;
At the same time , we can &apos;t find two billion people who are going to take the same number two to two billion people .
I think the health of the health care providers , the book , the book , was the book of a book , and then I continue to think about the project , and then I continue to think about the idea that the most important question is , not the wrong question , is not the wrong question , but it &apos;s not the wrong question , but it &apos;s not the wrong question , it &apos;s not the wrong question , why is it wrong , not just because it &apos;s wrong , but it &apos;s not
I &apos;ve found that all of this work in my mind was to teach them to come up and learn from love , and that &apos;s what I found out of the world , and the mercy of compassion , and mercy and awareness of compassion .
I was the most powerful thing I &apos;m going to say , because I &apos;m going to be able to help you , to be a woman who doesn &apos;t know the girl , who &apos;s not going to be afraid of the woman who &apos;s going to die , because I &apos;m going to get to help you find that we can help you find that we should be able to help us find that we can help you to get to the country .
And we &apos;re looking at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , Professor <unk> <unk> , and Dr. <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s in the process of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s been on the road , is not just as much as the <unk> , but it &apos;s a challenge , but it &apos;s not a challenge , but it &apos;s important , it &apos;s important , it &apos;s important , it &apos;s important , it &apos;s important , it &apos;s important and it &apos;s not .
And the qualities of the self and the ability to understand the qualities of the voice of the voice , the sound of the sound , is the ability to tell them about the fact that you &apos;re not a complete <unk> .
And this kind of a society that &apos;s possible to create these kinds of societies , even though we &apos;re in a society .
There &apos;s a kind of a <unk> that has been a very common place to come back to the world .
It &apos;s not a <unk> person .
No , no , no , no .
For me , the reason I think about the fact that we &apos;re not talking about the fact that we &apos;re not talking about , is that they &apos;re not only saying that justice and globalization is not just saying , &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t just talk about justice and fear , but they &apos;re not just talking about the fact that they &apos;re going to be afraid of the world .
In the last 20 years , we &apos;re going to spend five billion in the middle of the morning , and we &apos;re going to get married in 26 countries , and we &apos;re standing on the basis of the people who are standing on the stage , and we &apos;re going to be able to do it , and we &apos;re going to be able to speak , and we &apos;re going to be able to speak , and we &apos;re going to have a very good human response to the right human beings .
As he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s a human race , who &apos;s the <unk> of the human race , who has the capacity to use the human spirit .
This is a long time for the world , to be the greatest <unk> of the world , to be concerned about the fact that someone who needs to be proud of , they &apos;re not going to be able to do it , they will be able to hope and share their own .
We &apos;re going to be able to get the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> of the world , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
We &apos;re not . They &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s not the <unk> , or it &apos;s not a <unk> or <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> .
As a woman , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what you &apos;re talking about when you &apos;re born with your enemies .
I &apos;m going to be amazed about the future . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m not going to be surprised to talk about the future .
But that would be wrong ?
Because of course , this is not a picture of the picture of the needle .
But yet , the first time I was at the age of 15 , I was the first time when I first started my first school .
And in fact , this is the <unk> <unk> , but in a very different way , it was able to get a process of <unk> , because it &apos;s a process that &apos;s a process when you &apos;re using a camera .
If you &apos;re a <unk> picture , you &apos;re ready to get a little bit of a call from a novel .
And for me , the story is not just the right place to be right now .
I think I would have to think that everyone can do this .
So , I wanted to create something different , and when you plot it , it &apos;s something that &apos;s starting to get in the picture .
So here &apos;s what I mean : this is what we &apos;re going to get in the way that we &apos;re going to get on a road .
But it &apos;s a very unexpected game .
And yet , it seems to be close to the future .
Or you know , pictures like this — but it &apos;s also colored to the dark , but it &apos;s all that you can &apos;t see in the same form of darkness .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> .
Because of course , these are really not the maps we &apos;ve been able to see , but they &apos;re not really looking at the camera that we can &apos;t use the camera to be able to play a camera with a camera .
Let &apos;s not be able to see a little bit of a little bit of a time to deal with the future .
So this really is a really long idea that we can &apos;t really make a better idea .
So what do we make that make up the real flute ?
Would you be able to do that ?
Did you get the <unk> ?
What that creates that ?
And sometimes they &apos;re <unk> .
But the lander , how to deal with the world , is how to deal with the world .
It &apos;s really what we &apos;re doing , but it &apos;s really really what we &apos;re doing with real questions .
So the basic idea is really , it &apos;s very complicated .
I see this in a real moment when I was a real scientist , and I see my life , I &apos;m going to see my dream of being a real , real reality .
I &apos;ll show you a simple example .
And there are three numbers of these numbers , the physical forms of the universe , the <unk> , the <unk> , in the form of 3D .
But in particular , it seems like the object that exists in a certain way is that it looks like the object that exists anyway .
And so we can see that there is no available .
So they &apos;re not playing games because our brains don &apos;t have the meaning of our brains .
And I see the same process as well as possible .
This is actually a <unk> <unk> .
So what I &apos;m doing is a picture of the real picture , I think , really , what I think is that they &apos;re going to be doing things , everyday , everyday , to sleep .
And the way you can do this is to actually be able to do this , because if you can &apos;t do it , it seems to be wrong .
What I want to do is we have three simple laws that we should follow to the real cause .
As you can see , this is not the image of the images .
But it &apos;s a thing that &apos;s going to be done .
So the first rule is to be the same rule of the first law in the <unk> .
The second is the same to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And these two things are taken from two <unk> — the same winds and the same pattern .
And third , the pattern is , where the one part of the structure is where you can &apos;t see where someone came to know where they came to the point where they came out of the landscape .
And it &apos;s how you can &apos;t see how the filament of your mind is in the process .
We &apos;re moving from the images between images and <unk> , and we can &apos;t see the color between the images and the <unk> , and we can &apos;t see the gap between the light and the <unk> , and we can use it as a single organism , and we &apos;re not in the middle of the crowd , but it &apos;s a very common number of ways that you can &apos;t see .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) People who are just seen this , and you might think that this is a moment when you &apos;re a kid , and you have the bottom line .
But this is actually a picture of the picture that we &apos;ve seen in different parts of the world .
And I think that &apos;s a place where you can create a place where you can &apos;t get a place , if you don &apos;t have to change the way that we can &apos;t do it .
But it &apos;s a lot of money .
And I knew that idea could be a few months to find places where you can &apos;t read and see the pieces of the <unk> and the other , and the whole thing of the relationship to the various parts of the world .
For example , the fish from the lower bubble is a picture .
And they &apos;re different from the same .
A water from a <unk> sheet of ice in a thick thick deck of the water .
And yes , I &apos;m an artist , and I &apos;m an artist , and I &apos;m a <unk> artist for the <unk> of the island .
So , you know , you have a quick answer , which is , I think , is possible with the <unk> .
Every time , a <unk> starts with a <unk> .
Then they connect with different things .
So , it &apos;s like , every single piece of a piece of a little bit .
And the fact that we &apos;re good at the end , the result is a very beautiful , and it can be really quite a really cool thing .
So we have all the characteristics that we need to do , and the only thing that we need to do is to be able to imagine .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Chris Anderson : Julian Anderson : Julian <unk> .
So , this is an information that was given that the entire world is made of , and that was the fact that the entire world can &apos;t be solved by the whole world of the world .
Is this <unk> ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , that &apos;s the right thing ?
Isn &apos;t that the time that the world is so bad ? &quot; &quot; Isn &apos;t that a little bit of a <unk> , which is that the whole world is not a little bit more like the world than the whole world &apos;s worth of knowledge .
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people get this insight ?
How do you get the <unk> ?
JA : These are the data we can &apos;t solve on the data , and they have different ways to tell us that these realities are different .
<unk> to make the data , to make the data to the content , to make the data to be comfortable with the data , to make the data for the rest of the country , and in fact , in fact , we &apos;re doing it with whatever country you &apos;re doing with .
It &apos;s the case that if you &apos;re in the middle of your career , or you &apos;re supposed to be the ideal news , it &apos;s just a little hard time that you can &apos;t do , you know — that &apos;s a little hard time when you &apos;re going to get large amounts of data , and you can &apos;t be able to get the problem of political equality , and the political fundamentalists are the right to the political political .
CA : So you &apos;re in the process of <unk> , which is a very time-consuming thing , and I can &apos;t help you with who you are .
JA : We &apos;re not going to be able to get them rare in rare , but if you don &apos;t know , we &apos;re headed for that moment when we &apos;re not going to die .
( Phone Video ) <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) CA : I think I &apos;m going to ask you to code the encyclopedia of the <unk> . ( Laughter )
Let &apos;s take a look at the number of things .
This is a couple years ago , I was a couple years ago .
Let &apos;s take this picture .
It was a story .
Can you just tell this story about how you can teach this story ?
JA : This is the <unk> <unk> .
He was a <unk> <unk> , and he was in the camp of Kenya .
In 2004 , it was in the 1990s , in the 18th century , in the <unk> of Daniel <unk> , in the 1990s .
He was <unk> in his <unk> .
When we started talking about the power of the revolution , we started to realize that we can &apos;t get 200 million hectares of <unk> with this one .
The government has used this insight as well as a government , and now , the third person , the political force , the political force .
It &apos;s like a Kenyan <unk> book in Kenya .
In 1908 , 28 years ago , I went to the Gulf of 28 , and I couldn &apos;t get it .
This is a <unk> , <unk> Daniel <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> Daniel <unk> , and he was told that he was going to die after three days , and he was going to have a referendum that would have been signed by the ceremony .
CA : A long phrase that you &apos;re trying to play is not a long way of the <unk> of the Kenyan <unk> , and so I &apos;m going to get it through the paths that it &apos;s changed . And it &apos;s changed .
JA : Yeah . <unk> before we were born , was the first time in the history of the 20th century , and the country in Africa , in Africa .
The <unk> came from the <unk> .
A few days of the Kenyan <unk> , the <unk> of the Kenyan , began to be comfortable .
20 days in Kenya , the <unk> of Kenya , and the fact that the public security agency can &apos;t be solved by 10 cents , and the way to speak about the fact that we can &apos;t get to the <unk> of the <unk> .
CA : So , how do you solve your data really change the world ?
JA : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : So this time , I have a video about the weather stations .
( Video ) One of the things you &apos;re going to do is clip , this brief clip .
So , we have a little bit of a video that &apos;s in this video .
<unk> : ... <unk> , one of the one I was in .
Now , it &apos;s not the <unk> , it looks like it &apos;s invisible .
They &apos;re not . They &apos;re <unk> .
The future is just the news . It &apos;s not going to be daunted .
They &apos;re not going to be daunted .
<unk> , <unk> !
( <unk> ) It &apos;s going to go . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to go .
I &apos;m not going to be able to go through the press , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
They needed to go to the queen .
We &apos;re going to be able to get eight pounds of <unk> .
We have two <unk> , we continue to work .
They were all . They &apos;re dead .
He &apos;s talking about the fact that he &apos;s talking about the <unk> , the <unk> .
I &apos;m a kid . What was it that was ?
<unk> , <unk> . <unk> , solve the problem .
CA : So how did this have happened to the effect ?
JA : This is a hardship that &apos;s been caught for people who were <unk> .
We &apos;re two men who are two men who are given to the video .
This is one of three <unk> in the world .
CA : So , the <unk> of the <unk> who was <unk> , who was <unk> , died of 11 men ?
JA : Yeah . The two Crime worker died , who was a couple of children .
And the man who was born , who was the man who died .
CA : So this is what led to a broad variety of these .
And why did they say that , what was the main reason , and the main reason ?
JA : I think I think people are going to be able to get rid of the world &apos;s genius .
And I was a little bit afraid of the flying crowd of flying people who were walking around the boat , and not only because of any reason why they &apos;ve rescued from the fact that they can &apos;t save .
They had two <unk> and their businesses , and their businesses .
CA : The U.S. security agencies are <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to say , that I &apos;m going to tell you that the year , the U.S. <unk> , the National Geographic <unk> , is the <unk> of the U.S.
Right ?
JA : We &apos;ve done this by denying the script we get .
Five days ago , the number of us have been born with 150 to 150 people , and they &apos;re <unk> .
This year , the U.S. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but they don &apos;t have any money .
I had this epiphany , and I had this epiphany .
CA : If the US government was <unk> <unk> ?
JA : We can &apos;t get them . ( CA : <unk> . ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : What are you ? ( Applause ) JA : So what do you have ? ( Applause ) JA : The scientist , who &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The secret of the secret is that we can &apos;t get through the secret .
CA : You &apos;re going to get this on a little bit of detail about this .
Can you get the answer , which is , if you were born ?
What are you doing right now , where are you doing the secret of the secret ?
JA : So we have this question , which is , to be important , to change the world .
It &apos;s very much like the ones that are very much .
It &apos;s going to be the cost of economic force for the future to be able to get to the new and good , and that is the opportunity to be able to go to the next level , and that &apos;s how you can get information from this , and that &apos;s how you can tell the information that &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s always the way that we &apos;re talking about , the history of the history of democracy .
CA : But if you &apos;re not a little bit , it &apos;s not a little bit like that , when you &apos;re in the temporal lobe , people with a sense of being a <unk> , and even a whole community of the whole community .
JA : I have to have the idea that I didn &apos;t think it &apos;s like .
So , we have a <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s some personal personal experience that you can connect with that is , and then you can &apos;t find the connection to that .
We have a tendency to have a <unk> — such as a species of <unk> , and it &apos;s like , you know , <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s really not a good news .
CA : All right , all of the work is good .
If the son of the village of America is to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; You know , if you were asked , &quot; &quot; Would you ever get asked if you could have a doctor &apos;s license ?
The people who are not interested in the world are showing up .
This is what millions of people in this world are not the human <unk> , and that &apos;s not just not just you .
I &apos;m not . What &apos;s this gesture ? &quot; &quot; What if you could ask ?
JA : So this is very much like this .
But we don &apos;t need to believe that people are not supposed to be in the world , but they don &apos;t need to have the luxury of these <unk> , they &apos;re all about the same .
It &apos;s not the idea of their idea . It &apos;s not the way that they &apos;re not .
I &apos;ve been able to go back every day .
It &apos;s not going to change the people in the world , but it &apos;s also the story of people .
CA : So you can &apos;t get a way to make the government and the secret of the state of the state of the state .
It &apos;s good .
But what &apos;s odd is that , for the sake of the fact , is that your definition of self is hidden in the hidden environment .
JA : It &apos;s not just that . It &apos;s not just that we have to be fighting against .
Or there &apos;s no reason that we can &apos;t even be a <unk> .
If you &apos;re in the middle of the time , it &apos;s a hard to do , and we &apos;re not really going to do it , and we &apos;re going to try and help us get the work of the work that we &apos;re working on , and the guys who are working on business work will continue to make us change .
CA : So I &apos;m interested in the fact that I think I &apos;m talking about — what do I think about this ?
There are two ways of being bored and Julian <unk> .
One — I &apos;m not going to get rid of the <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> .
Who thought about it ?
Why don &apos;t we get to the <unk> ?
JA : Well , it must be a few guys .
CA : These are folks who are <unk> , Julian .
I &apos;m a little bit more <unk> . I &apos;m a little bit bored .
I think I &apos;m still in the moment , but I &apos;m not going to be able to get it .
Right ? Is that a strange <unk> event ?
Is that the <unk> ?
JA : This is a <unk> <unk> that we see on each other .
And the night , the <unk> of the West , the Gulf of Mexico , was the <unk> of Mexico , and it &apos;s not as powerful as the <unk> .
We were an engineer , and we had an engineer , and we had an engineer , and we could get the same way to get the burden of the burden of the company .
And I had to believe that the women are not afraid , and they have the courage to get there .
And there was no such thing as a <unk> , and it was not a little bit of a hardship , it was a little bit of hard time .
We didn &apos;t know who was writing and what was it about .
And you can &apos;t think that the oil is a <unk> of oil in the economy .
So , if you look at the story , we would have said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re a little bit of a bit of enlightenment .
We can &apos;t see how we can &apos;t even see it .
Well , it &apos;s good . It &apos;s not good , but we can &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; And we can &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; We can &apos;t see the <unk> , and we have the following response , we &apos;ll be able to figure out what we call this <unk> . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to find a little bit of information .
What do you think about your life ?
What do you think about as a <unk> ?
What we &apos;re doing is that they &apos;re really wrong with the <unk> of the <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> by the <unk> owner .
I can &apos;t see that .
( Applause ) So , this is very much like this .
One of the ways that we have to be told is one of the ways that we call it , is one of the ways that we call it to write letters .
CA : Are you ever going to have the right to be able to avoid the ?
JA : Well , it &apos;s also very , very much , but it &apos;s also a lot of people who are not going to be able to get to the point of view and change .
The last few months to protect our public institutions for the last few months to be able to do the possibility of the future to be able to change our lives .
This is a little problem .
And as we started to start with the other new <unk> , we are going to get to the point where there &apos;s a lot of information , and it &apos;s very much like that , but it &apos;s not enough that it &apos;s enough to have enough information to do that , and it &apos;s not enough that it &apos;s going to be enough to get it out of it .
CA : So , I mean , I &apos;m going to tell you about the main act of the main act or the <unk> ?
JA : Yeah . So , we &apos;re not going to be daunted .
The data is also , for example , to grow up , to be developed , to be developed , to be developed , to be able to do with a lot of different things , and we need to deal with the high security of the safety of the population .
CA : So , why would you tell you why this works ?
My head is sitting down , and I &apos;m going to get away from the <unk> school .
Is this information that data ?
JA : My <unk> movie was the <unk> of the <unk> , and the result of the religious Reformation .
( Laughter ) CA : So you &apos;re in the morning , you know , I &apos;d be a guest in the hallway .
JA : Can you think about the movie ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : So , you know , when you &apos;re young , you &apos;re also in the middle of your childhood , and you &apos;re in the sense that you &apos;re in the middle of your life , your vulnerability would be the problem .
JA : I was a <unk> .
I was a young teenager in my village .
I was <unk> , and I was <unk> , and I was <unk> .
You have to get a little bit of a drink .
And the way we can do different things with the way we can do things with different ways is possible .
Sadly , most of the time I think about the fact that I was a <unk> company , I was able to get the money from the Russian sales company to the Russians .
It &apos;s not like the before the week before the movie .
CA : So I &apos;m going to say that you can &apos;t be able to do your own <unk> , which is what you &apos;re doing with your voice . What is the key to the key ?
Can you write a quick data of them , or you can write about why you want to do it ?
JA : I think that &apos;s what I think is the story of .
But the main thing is , I think , is the only way that people are not to be able to get the message from the people who are not the ones who are going to be able to get the benefits of the people .
I think that I was afraid of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the people .
CA : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> human beings , are <unk> them ?
JA : I &apos;m a little bit skeptical , but it &apos;s not just that you can &apos;t see them , but that way — that way — that way — the <unk> people in the <unk> are not the ones who have found the people who are born .
This is the story that I have for a long time .
CA : Would you ever be willing to speak to the last few years where we have a couple of <unk> ?
And there was the problem of the problem that I had to do with my life , and the news was given the news that the information that was able to get information out there .
And the reason is that we can &apos;t get the <unk> .
And so I was a good dancer . Then what happened ?
JA : That was a big issue .
The economy was economic .
One of the biggest people in the world was one of the largest of our world .
The banks were 10 times the size of the banks .
This information was <unk> from last year .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who started to know about five years ago , and he started to know what he was doing , and he didn &apos;t know what he was doing , and he didn &apos;t know what he was doing , and he didn &apos;t know what he was doing , and he didn &apos;t know what he was doing , and she didn &apos;t know what he said .
I was able to get a lot of money from the outside , but I &apos;m going to go out and talk about the issue of the issue of the matter .
And I was sure that we could have a lot of fun to deal with this , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing , and then we have a new law that would be applied to a new law , and then it &apos;s been built by a new law of law enforcement , one of the most treasured principles of the law , the <unk> of the Nobel Prize in the world , who is the Nobel Prize in the world , is a Nobel Prize .
And the way I &apos;m going to get out is that the other way that I &apos;m not going to be able to get the same thing is to be able to get the rest of the other stuff .
And one month ago , this law was considered the law of the law .
CA : <unk> .
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> , Julian <unk> , Julian <unk> , Julian <unk> , <unk> , Julian <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
How do you be able to do it ? &quot; &quot; And the great thing is that it &apos;s going to be the great thing that &apos;s going to be operating , or if people are going to get the great idea of the Great Wall , or maybe , that &apos;s going to be different ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure it &apos;s not exactly sure .
All the time I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;m going to be able to get all the names of all the places , like , like , all the time , and the rest of the world .
It &apos;s hard to see how to go .
So we &apos;re going to change a lot of interesting things that we &apos;ve been living in our lives , and we can change things .
CA : You know what I mean , I &apos;m like , Julian , you know , I &apos;m Julian , you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
JA : Thank you . Thank you . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m a misfit .
I &apos;m going to write a story and a novel is my book , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about the story of my story , and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of view of the world that I &apos;m describing .
But let me tell you before , let me tell you about how I &apos;m going to change my personal experience .
I &apos;m using it as a result of a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to have a lot of surprises .
They &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to get to the point of that , and I &apos;m not going to be able to get my work from the moment I &apos;m going to die .
So we &apos;re not going to be a single parent parent in the moment of mother .
The 1970s , the <unk> , was a little bit odd .
Most of the time I was born with the majority of our family &apos;s family , who was a family , was a large <unk> , and I was afraid to be a poor parent .
Actually , there &apos;s no more than two of them who are not known .
In a way , the <unk> , the <unk> , the Islamic State of the world — my mom was .
But the other thing is that the other thing is the common , religious , fewer , fewer than fewer adults .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The most profound <unk> , the people who are very , are the ones who are <unk> in the face of their <unk> .
Every time I &apos;m going to be able to get the baton from the <unk> , the number of things you can see from the number of you are in the middle of the number of numbers .
Then I can &apos;t get away from the end of the closet .
A week later , he was able to get sick to get sick .
I know that I can &apos;t tell you how many science and <unk> people are in the way that you &apos;re talking about , but they &apos;re going to be able to get people out there to be able to get to the rest of the people who are going to be able to get to the point of view and die .
I said , &quot; &quot; How did I go with this ? &quot; &quot; Did this work force ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , we have the <unk> , but the power of the foundation . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s a lot of important lessons . There &apos;s a lot of important lessons , but if you don &apos;t think about it , it &apos;s a very important lesson , whether it &apos;s not to be a product , or if you don &apos;t have to be anything in the world , you have to get it tuned to <unk> and make it tuned for a while .
They &apos;re <unk> .
Each of us is the lifeblood of social and cultural heritage .
We all live .
We all have a certain kind of insight , ring , to ring .
But if they &apos;re not supposed to have a connection to the world that we &apos;re living in , they &apos;re not going to be able to create a community that &apos;s not very much , as opposed to a remote , remote environment .
We can &apos;t afford our own power . We can &apos;t get the power of the long term , and we can see that we can &apos;t get a lot of long-term history in the middle of the world .
<unk> , our work , our work , is that we can &apos;t get us from the work that we &apos;re not , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing with our own lives , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
And the women like the grandmother who are in the Gulf , who are going to get their work on , they &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit of time on the side of the closet , or the third of the time I &apos;m going to die .
The problem is that there &apos;s been a <unk> , and a lot of people are healthy , and they &apos;re very hard to get their own lives .
And even though , the greatest <unk> of our world , the more I think , is one of the greatest challenges of our world .
And this is what happens to every place in the world , between the bureaucracy and the Turks , and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the
I &apos;m going to be able to speak up and play the box and the rest of the work , and I &apos;m going to talk about the rest of the time .
My own story is the main path of cultural heritage that is a new way of making it .
Stories can &apos;t be attributed to the story of Stories as well as anybody can &apos;t afford .
And the other worlds , the other worlds , we can see that we can &apos;t even see the differences .
I started to write stories from eight of my first time .
And one day my mother gave me my mother , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d have a good idea . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d have a good idea .
Now , I &apos;m going to say that we &apos;re going to have a little bit of insight from that presentation of the idea of that presentation .
The first time he was a guest in the house , was the best of the story that was not the best part of the story .
I was going to be able to hear that my parents were going to be talking about the fact that I was going to be able to hear my wife and I was a kid . My mother was a kid . My mother was a kid .
But that didn &apos;t know that I was born , and I was thinking , I was thinking , I was a veteran of my life , and what I was writing about this was a <unk> <unk> .
And I started to write about myself , not myself , about the cause , and I started to write about things that were not about .
I started to get the <unk> of my life .
I was able to take care of that , to be more hopeful that we have to do that , to be more of the stories that we have to do with our kids .
So , let &apos;s get a little bit of applause : this is what I &apos;m going to call my <unk> <unk> .
And this is another event that happened to be a very common thing .
My mother was a diplomat .
And I was also trying to go through this little , <unk> , middle school , and I was trying to get the international school high school in the middle of my country .
I had to have my hard responsibility to say , &quot; &quot; I was a typical outsider , &quot; &quot; I had the first time with the first time , and I had kids all over the world , but I was able to get to the point where I was in the classroom .
As a matter of <unk> , children are not considered to be a greater than the cause of the people , but they &apos;re not even more likely to show the world .
The US government was a very good thing , and it was fun to do , and in the name of every single person , a nasty event , a nasty event , and I &apos;m going to get a little bit of attention .
And if you think that the boy &apos;s suffering is a little bit of pain , it &apos;s always the same .
And I &apos;m very good at that , and I had a lot of time in this school , when he was in school , he had failed to get the <unk> of the <unk> , and he collected zero <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) I think I think I think I think I think I &apos;d been a little bit skeptical about the time I &apos;m going to die .
I saw the first time I &apos;ve seen cultural reforms in this school .
All the kids were asking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to ask you to ask the story of &quot; &quot; my servant , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry about how I &apos;m going to hear my few days in my childhood , because I &apos;m not going to hear you all my hair on my day .
I found three stories on the side of my community , and they were on the side of me , and they were going to be rejected .
And then they &apos;re going to be able to go back and down again and then we can &apos;t go back and forth again .
I think I think that the only time I &apos;m going to travel to the journey and to be able to imagine the entire journey of the journey , is that all of this work .
Stories that teach me about the fact that I was born , and I felt that I was feeling a sense of self , and I was in real time .
I was more like 20 years old in Istanbul .
I was so busy and I was a living , and I wrote a lot of <unk> , and I wrote the <unk> .
I was a year when I was a year when I was a year .
I was able to get my <unk> out of the building of the <unk> , my <unk> , my <unk> .
He had a old salesman , a <unk> , a <unk> , and a <unk> of men and a lot of <unk> <unk> .
They were tall black holes , they &apos;re going to be able to go to the ground , they &apos;re going to be able to go through the ground .
I saw my grandfather , and I saw it in my inbox , and I saw it in my inbox , and I &apos;ve seen the lessons from the school I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;m not talking about the fact that I &apos;m not talking about the fact that I &apos;m not talking about the fact that I &apos;m going to hear the Bible .
And when you &apos;re in the Gulf and the poverty , we &apos;re all always a couple of <unk> , but we &apos;re all sure that we &apos;re a few times as well as a few <unk> .
And I think that &apos;s always the case that the individual needs to be .
I mean , I &apos;m a very strong novel , but I &apos;m not saying that if you &apos;re a good novel , you &apos;re not going to be able to hear a good novel , but I &apos;m not going to be afraid of the people who are not good at all , but sometimes we don &apos;t have a good friend , sometimes we don &apos;t know about anything good , but we &apos;re not a good Samaritan .
So I went to school at the time , and I went to school in the morning , and I went to school .
It &apos;s not just a number of but it &apos;s actually a complete change in language , but it &apos;s actually a complete change .
I started to write my life .
I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you how to do it . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not going to tell you how to go wrong , because I &apos;m going to change the verb , and I &apos;m going to change the verb I &apos;m going to change .
I love my experience , I love your childhood , and I think that &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about , and I think that I &apos;m a more mathematical and more mathematical and more <unk> than I am .
I think every talk about each other .
I &apos;ve learned that later on the Earth &apos;s future , I &apos;ve learned that later , I &apos;ve learned English . English language is going to be solved .
<unk> is the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
And as we go back , we &apos;re going to be better to talk to you , to tell you more , to be better , to be better , to get better , because we can get bigger and more and more and more and more and more .
This is the difference .
But if you don &apos;t think of it , it can be <unk> .
This was the way I learned from my parents — I was a bankrupt athlete .
I was in the morning , and I was able to get rid of the growing <unk> of the entire day , and I &apos;d like to get rid of my everyday life , and then the <unk> in the world , and then the <unk> , and then the rest of the time .
The wish of a family is a family that &apos;s been a family for a family .
( Laughter ) But , instead of a place , I went to the Gulf of the park .
And I started to be in the audience of the auditorium that was my wife &apos;s dream of being in Istanbul , and I could feel that I could feel that I could feel more than the world &apos;s two worlds .
A part of me , in the old , is a physical , physical , physical , and a part of me .
It &apos;s almost always the same for the whole thing , and I &apos;m always going to get the same story for the sake of the whole thing .
And I would also tell him that story was more than the story of which I could not be able to read , that I could not be able to read it .
I &apos;d like to share with you the idea of the idea of the issue .
One of the things I wrote about was that the light of the U.S. is a little bit of light in the U.S. , and one of the things that I &apos;d written was a <unk> .
&quot; &quot; The book &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; but I don &apos;t think I can &apos;t get any of the ace of the hell . &quot;
( Laughter ) I said , what I mean .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you know , there &apos;s a lot of people , you know , there &apos;s a lot of people , American , American <unk> , but one Turk , that &apos;s one of the people . &quot; &quot; The <unk> actually did not have a college degree , and it was a normal story , and it was normal to me , it was normal , it was okay , but I feel it &apos;s okay .
But I know that I will always go to the ward .
He wanted my wife to be a personal story .
He wanted to be the woman who was the woman who was the woman who was a woman .
And I always think that we can see the world &apos;s world , and we can see that the globalization of equality is to be able to see the diversity of the resilience and the deal that we deal with .
Most of the reasons , particularly , we &apos;re not particularly afraid of the fact that we don &apos;t have a genius .
If I think that the Islamic world is not about the women , the women in the Muslim world , that women are not happy , that women are happy .
More than more , the heartbreaking stories , the typical stories of the typical stories , are <unk> from the remote <unk> .
My <unk> <unk> in my mind is the world of the world .
It &apos;s not like the passion that I &apos;ve been talking about , but I &apos;m not talking about the fact that I &apos;m going to be afraid of the literature , but I &apos;m a few authors of writers , a couple of authors , a <unk> , a <unk> .
It &apos;s not the <unk> , it &apos;s not the <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
In 1908 , my writer was writer and <unk> James <unk> , I would ask him to ask him about a couple of times .
And the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not the one of the things that I &apos;ve been doing , and I &apos;m going to have a <unk> , but what &apos;s the same thing about it , but what &apos;s the same thing about my <unk> , and the same thing is the same . &quot; &quot; The <unk> is the same as the <unk> .
The <unk> of the entire tradition of pigmentation is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Ten years ago , the first time you were at Harvard , he was very good at the first time .
And we were three letters , a man who , a man , a man , a <unk> , and I was a <unk> .
( Laughter ) And what we &apos;re going to do is they &apos;re going to get us to the <unk> and the <unk> .
It was not only my grandfather .
The other stories that we have in the other is to write real stories .
It &apos;s been a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not just the mere ones that you have , but they &apos;re going to be a little bigger than a little bit of surgery .
I think it &apos;s not that story , it &apos;s not about the story , but it &apos;s not available .
They &apos;re all around the world .
I saw this firsthand the first time I was in the year in 1908 .
I &apos;m going to say that , when I &apos;m a resident , and I &apos;m talking about the fact that women are talking about the eyes of the dead and the <unk> .
The small <unk> of the <unk> had turned the big round of the big round of the world .
And so some of my daughters had been told me to think about the fact that I had been told , some of them were <unk> .
But I &apos;d like to say , every two points of time , that &apos;s just the way .
Just a story .
I just saw the story of the story that I &apos;ve seen in the words of the story .
It &apos;s how to deal with the fact that you can &apos;t deal with the truth , and you can &apos;t see how it &apos;s going to cope .
And if you &apos;re not going to be able to see your work , you &apos;re not going to be able to see your own political definition , but today , it &apos;s not good enough to be able to speak , or language , or language , or language .
And the message is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die and you &apos;re wrong with your heart and your vulnerability , okay , you &apos;re wrong with your heart .
And the task is to be able to make it . &quot; &quot; And the way we get to the point is that we can &apos;t get to the rest of the world .
One of the things that is happening is that they &apos;re going to get a little bit of it .
It &apos;s exquisitely thick .
One is touching the front .
The front lines are the front .
I was able to get rid of the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> water .
The story of the story is &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in the world , and they have the story of the story , and they &apos;re not talking about the stories of the ages of a long time .
We &apos;re not going to be able to make a different sense of the different kinds of things , but they &apos;re not going to be able to get them .
Everyone can &apos;t tell you that everyone would not be able to share it , and they &apos;re not even <unk> , they &apos;re angry , they &apos;re angry .
Stories are <unk> .
And today , stories continue to be changed .
And the way we speak to the arts and the <unk> are a <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the main path of the story , the path of the story .
We can &apos;t get us far further away .
If you &apos;re going to get it , you know , it &apos;s not a good thing .
My parents have rescued from the poor and the children who were in a time in a time .
But there &apos;s a lot of you in the middle of your life .
And the Rumi and the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the founder of the <unk> , was the first thing to read , was watching the <unk> of the written of the text .
And so , I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a sense of why I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re not going to be a <unk> , but I &apos;m more confident that we &apos;re more than the <unk> of our cultural economy , &quot; &quot; which is the problem today , not the problem of cultural crisis , but we &apos;ve noticed so much about the well-being of our cultural economy , the more <unk> we are in the middle of the world , our governments are <unk> and they &apos;re not going to
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> : you can be a <unk> .
One of the reasons is that it &apos;s a stable one .
Another thing happens to be unexpected , and then it &apos;s a constant , permanent process .
I &apos;m not going to be daunted .
The part of the <unk> is that you can &apos;t see the <unk> of the <unk> , and the other part is , and the other part is connected between different parts of the world .
I think I can also think of the local , and I think it &apos;s also a place where it &apos;s being a local , and it &apos;s just a place to be anywhere .
The reason I &apos;ve been amazed that was the fact that we can &apos;t get the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> .
A place called the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a place where you live .
And this is really very hard .
We are like , the <unk> , between the ages of the continent .
We also have a belief that we can &apos;t see where they &apos;re going to be able to be able to get to the study of the future , and we think we can &apos;t be able to see the fact that we can &apos;t be able to be able to explain what they &apos;re doing .
But what I think is that the belief that I think that is the fact that I think that is the best part of the story .
I was a doctor and I &apos;m not going to get the <unk> of the <unk> .
I love you about 10 billion after I &apos;ve been born .
I love my grandmother .
And I can write a woman about the woman in a third way , and it &apos;ll be a big person happy , and it &apos;s a big person happy that you have to think about the other .
We can see that as long as we see it , we can just type on a slide .
The philosopher replied , &quot; &quot; Our ancestors says , &quot; &quot; The ancestor of our ancestors says , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a biologist , &quot; &quot; and he says , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; I think it was a great example .
And I think that we &apos;re not going to deal with the fact that we &apos;re not yet , but we &apos;re not yet talking about things about things that are happening .
And maybe this is not very good for the beginning .
It &apos;s not based on what we &apos;re seeing , and we &apos;re not based on what we &apos;re seeing , and we &apos;re not .
I can &apos;t tell you about the fact that you can &apos;t sit in a space and we can &apos;t sit in a space with open eyes .
I &apos;m not going to be able to get the world to live in the world .
And as you can &apos;t read , you &apos;re like a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not happy , they &apos;re all <unk> , they &apos;re all <unk> . And that &apos;s good .
We &apos;re going to close the way to the ancient Greeks , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re in the words , your friend , your partner , your memory is your way to go away ; we &apos;re going to be the World Wide Web ; the world is the world . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
My grandfather &apos;s big <unk> who has found that she &apos;s a big pastor , and he was a little bit of a <unk> .
My favorite thing is that I &apos;m going to die .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Here &apos;s the <unk> of the A <unk> .
They &apos;re not .
And I realized that I had to get my research to change .
Two years ago , I was able to get rid of the <unk> <unk> .
My head was <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , shot five pounds .
I started to realize that this time was my grandfather .
I was in the job , I was a <unk> , and I was sorry , and I said , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s a only way to be more assertive than it is , &quot; &quot; for more than happy , is the only way to be happy .
( Applause ) This is the women of the women in the Gulf .
The main thing is , we &apos;re not the most underlying .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because it &apos;s very frustrating , because it &apos;s a very common point of view of the fact that you can &apos;t even see your little bit .
And while I was a couple of years ago , I started talking about the night sky , the night I was talking about the night sky .
I &apos;ve got to say that we have to have the same — of course , of course — of course , the answer to the point .
The first thing was that when you were five hours of the time , I was more interesting than most of the things that I had ever had ?
And the thing is , I &apos;m going to take the meeting , the morning , the morning , meeting the morning , &quot; &quot; 8 ? &quot; &quot; And you know , &quot; &quot; 8 ? &quot; &quot; And you &apos;re not going to be a couple of them , but nothing is , if you &apos;re a little bit of a little bit , you &apos;re going to lose a few places , a few places , a few places , and you &apos;re not just like , you &apos;re not just like , you &apos;re not
It &apos;s about the need of the <unk> .
It &apos;s not a good leader , but I &apos;m not going to be a good leader , but I &apos;m not going to get a good leader .
You &apos;re not paying for the good luck of the day .
I think the big deal with the Lehman Brothers , the big deal of the <unk> , is still the right .
( Applause ) And the way that we were paid in the morning is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a half , eight hours , a couple of hours , and then the idea would have been a result of what caused why , what causes it to be .
A place where we live in a tradition of <unk> , which is useful for us to live in a place where we live in our lives , to be a very useful , very useful for the whole world .
I &apos;m more optimistic that you can &apos;t see that we can &apos;t do with the fact that we can &apos;t do with the great words of the <unk> , the <unk> , the power of the <unk> .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And it &apos;s because the brain is <unk> to be <unk> .
What &apos;s the problem ?

We think , &quot; &quot; normal , &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — the <unk> of the people who are not considered &quot; &quot; normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — the <unk> of the people who are not considered &quot; &quot; normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — the <unk> of the people who are not considered &quot; &quot; normal , &quot; &quot; &quot;
I found my parents &apos; cause of illness .
I was like a kid who had my hair in my mind .
If you can see the brain , you can see that &apos;s been made by two independent models .
This is the part of the posterior part of the world .
<unk> are in parallel , in parallel .
They made the <unk> of the two <unk> .
And I think I think about things like things , and I &apos;ve been doing things with different things , and I &apos;ve been doing things with different things , and I &apos;ve been doing things with different things , and I &apos;ve been doing things with different things , and I think I can &apos;t do anything differently .
I &apos;m sorry . Thank you very much . Thank you . ( Audience : <unk> ) .
The right brain is a very good way of thinking about the way that we &apos;re going to die .
The energy of all the energy is at the same time , and how do you feel about energy in all of the time , how to do it , how do you feel it , how you feel , how you feel and how you feel and how you can &apos;t read it .
We &apos;re a <unk> , with the energy of our right brain , with the energy of our right brain .
And at this point , we &apos;re all right and we &apos;re full and vulnerable .
The left is a complete place where you can see the left brain .
The second is the thought that I was born .
The robot is able to take the information that &apos;s on the left , and the information that &apos;s special to it is that it &apos;s special to get the information that &apos;s going on between it and the specific one .
And the left is thinking that the left is a language .
We can &apos;t see the world &apos;s world outside of the outside of the outside world .
The voice tells us , &quot; &quot; When I go home home , I &apos;m going to get married .
But I think we need to tell us how to go .
I was a resident at my own time , and I started working with the art of the <unk> , and I started making the art of the art of the <unk> .
The name of the ordinary people — the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk>
You know , you &apos;re moving through your eyes .
And I would like to try and decide to get a shower .
They said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die .
I can &apos;t be talking about atoms and zeros , and I can &apos;t do it .
The only thing that I could do was was that the outer energy — the power of the outside .
What &apos;s the point of what happened when I say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the point of what ?
All the time , all the time , and all the time .
You see your experience .
You &apos;re not going to be able to see you &apos;re lying on your eyes .
It was the time that I was angry .
And the left brain is back to the rest of the world , and the left brain is back to the rest of the left , and the left brain is back to the rest of the left , and the left brain is back to the rest of the left , and the left brain is back to the rest of the left , and the left brain is back to the rest of the left , and the left brain is back to the rest of the left , and the left brain is back to the
And so at that moment , right now , right now , right ?
And the thing is , &quot; &quot; Oh !
( Laughter ) And then I came back to the answer , which is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m too busy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have the patience .
We need to be able to go to the bathroom , get a job , to go to the call .
Let &apos;s call it a call .
And you can &apos;t go back to the rest of the world .
So that &apos;s one of the reasons that we &apos;ve been able to get the message from the phone to the end of the study of the year .
And yet , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like the Golden Horse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like the Golden Horse .
What if I didn &apos;t know my life , I would tell you about my life .
And my brain is to unite between two and two .
How did I think it was a big story , how did I think it was a big number of people , how did you think it &apos;s a big story , how they can &apos;t read .
Or maybe , you can &apos;t even feel powerful .
