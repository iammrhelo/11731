A few years ago Peter <unk> here , at TED , show you a <unk> .
The <unk> .
The idea is , the idea is fairly simple : <unk> from four to four pieces of spaghetti , a meter tape , a meter tape , a meter rope and a marshmallow .
The marshmallow must be on it .
And , although it sounds like this , it &apos;s very hard , because it &apos;s very hard , because this task force forces to work together .
And because I thought this was an interesting idea , I decided to take it into a <unk> .
And it was a big success .
Since then , I &apos;ve spent this practice in about 70 <unk> workshops around the world with students , designers and architects , and even with bosses of Fortune <unk> .
And this exercise gives us deep insights into how people cooperate , and I want to share some of those with you .
Normally , the first step is to prepare people like this ,
They talk about it , how it &apos;s going to look like this , play <unk> .
Then they &apos;re going to plan plan .
They sketches like spaghetti sauce ,
Most of the time they &apos;re going to build larger <unk> of spaghetti sauce .
And at the end , when it &apos;s time , someone &apos;s going to pick up the marshmallow they put it down on top of it , one step back and forth -- <unk> !
They admire their jobs .
But what happens is , it &apos;s mostly , it &apos;s the &quot; <unk> &quot; changes in a &quot; <unk> &quot; , because the weight of the marshmallow will <unk> the whole <unk> and <unk> .
Now , you know , some people have more of the &quot; oh oh . &quot;
What of the worst are college graduates with an MBA .
They lie , they &apos;re <unk> , they get distracted , and they make pretty silly <unk> .
And of course , there &apos;s some teams that make a lot more &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And in the best part of them , it &apos;s a graduate student .
That &apos;s impressive .
And Peter tells us , it &apos;s not just the biggest <unk> that are the most interesting .
So what you &apos;re going to ask is , how could this ? Why ? Why ?
<unk> &apos;s answer is , &quot; None of the kids are wasting the time of the spaghetti sauce <unk> . &quot; Right .
They don &apos;t waste time ,
But there &apos;s a reason .
And that &apos;s why economists are trained to find the only solution .
And then they &apos;re going to do that .
But what happens when they put the marshmallow up on the marshmallow , they don &apos;t have time anymore .
It &apos;s a catastrophe .
Sounds familiar , right ?
What is <unk> different ...
is that they begin with the marshmallow .
They build prototypes , and new prototypes ...
with the marshmallow up on the top , so they have more opportunities to repair the bad prototypes .
Designers recognize this form of collaboration as the foundation of a <unk> process .
In every single version , the children can get feedback on what &apos;s going to do and what doesn &apos;t work ?
So building prototypes is very important .
But let &apos;s look at how different teams it does .
The average thing for most people is about 50 centimeters ...
economists get half the number , lawyers do it , but not much better .
<unk> , better than most adults .
Who &apos;s doing it ?
Architects and engineers , fortunately .
The highest <unk> that I &apos;ve seen was a meter tall .
And why ? Because they ? Because they understand triangles , and <unk> <unk> structures are key to building stable <unk> .
CEOs , something better than average .
But now , it &apos;s interesting : if you put a <unk> at the team when you get it a lot better .
Incredible . You see the team and he thinks , &quot; who win . &quot;
That &apos;s what you can see . And why ?
because they &apos;re good at supporting .
They manage to manage the process .
And every team that &apos;s focused on it and it &apos;s paying attention to the work that &apos;s the performance of the team .
<unk> and supportive skills leads to a success .
If you have 10 teams doing this , if you want to do 10 teams this , it &apos;s going to have a <unk> structure .
And I was trying something interesting .
I thought we were making it more exciting .
So I <unk> 10,000 dollars from software to the winning team .
And what do you think this <unk> did ?
What happened ?
The next one .
Not a single team had a <unk> structure .
A <unk> for example , for example , for example , a centimeter that was enough to win .
Now , what &apos;s interesting is that there &apos;s major impact of action .
We have repeat the exercise of the same students ,
And what do you think that happened ?
So now they understand the use of prototypes .
And this team changed the worst team in one of the best .
They took the highest <unk> at least .
So that &apos;s a good lesson for us about the nature of rewards and success .
You might wonder , why would someone want to spend time doing a <unk> ?
The reason is , I &apos;m working with building digital tools and processes to help teams to build cars , <unk> and visual effects .
And the <unk> helps to see behind the hidden assumptions .
Because , frankly , every project has his own marshmallow , right ?
The challenge provides a shared experience , a shared language , a collective control to the best prototype .
And so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise .
And it &apos;s like <unk> , go to <unk> .
On this blog , you can see how to build the <unk> .
There are <unk> <unk> .
There are examples of how people have tricks all over the world and <unk> <unk> .
There are also <unk> .
And the fundamental lesson is , I think , design is a <unk> .
The stakes of all our senses , and we think we think of our best way to think , sense of what &apos;s going to happen to us .
And sometimes a small prototype of this experience has already been enough to change on &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
And that makes a difference .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s suppose that we have a machine , a machine , a big machine , a &quot; cool &quot; and it &apos;s a time machine .
And everybody here must .
You can go back in time or progress in time , but not here , and right here .
I &apos;m curious what you might choose , because I &apos;ve asked this question of all sorts of friends , and they all want to go back .
They all want to go back to time before cars or Twitter or American Idol .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of hanging from nostalgia to <unk> .
And I can get there .
But I don &apos;t listen to that , I don &apos;t have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and not because I &apos;m <unk> , but it &apos;s the capacity of this planet .
They &apos;re not going backwards , going forward .
So , I want to be able to go into the machine , and I want to take forward in time .
We live in the <unk> of time on this planet at any given time to be healthy , wealth , mobility , chances of diseases .
Never was there a time like this .
My <unk> died all around the age of 60 .
My grandparents had all over the 1970s .
And my parents are already in the 80s .
So I &apos;m hoping to get a lot out of the 90 to get it into the 90 .
But it &apos;s not even about us .
There &apos;s a lot more on the game .
A child that today is born in New Delhi has a life expectancy equivalent to the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
Think about that . That &apos;s an incredible fact .
And why is that ?
The smallpox epidemic . The smallpox epidemic was taking billions of people on this planet .
They had a impact on the demographics of this world as much of any of the war .
But they don &apos;t exist anymore . They &apos;re gone .
We have overcome them . <unk> !
In the richer world , there are diseases that have millions of people , millions of people , <unk> , so good .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
Somebody else does this ?
<unk> , modern medicine is our ability to deliver billions of food to billions of food to the scientific method .
And for me , it &apos;s the scientific method , the beginning of things , whether it works and it doesn &apos;t matter if it works , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
That &apos;s the good news .
But unfortunately , it &apos;s the only good news because there &apos;s a lot of other problems , they &apos;ve already named after , and one is that , despite all our achievements , there &apos;s always a billion people hungry in this world , every day .
Their numbers take up , and it goes fast , and it &apos;s a shame .
And not just that , we also used to use our imagination to pollute this world .
<unk> water , agricultural water , oil , oil , oil : they &apos;re disappearing , and when we can &apos;t be able to be our progress of innovation , we will go away .
So the question is , what is it ? I think that ?
And I think it &apos;s clear that we can be able to make food for billions of years without the country that we live in .
And I think we can deliver this world of <unk> that can &apos;t help it .
I really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
But now that &apos;s what I want you to wake up at night -- one of the things I wake up of night .
We never have any way of doing that of scientific progress , never , and we never could have been able to use it as we can today .
We are at the cusp of the most amazing progress of all sorts of things .
And yet , I really think about hundreds of years , say , 300 years , we have to go back to time for the time of the Enlightenment , to find a time we turned out that we were going to turn out of progress , that we were going to <unk> these innovations and over more areas , we fought .
People hang on their <unk> with such a <unk> that it &apos;s almost impossible to fix them .
And listen , all right , everybody has right on their own opinions ; everybody has even the right to your own opinions about what progress is , but you know where you don &apos;t ?
You don &apos;t have any right to your own facts . No , you don &apos;t .
And I &apos;ve spent some time doing this to try to realize .
A dozen years ago , I wrote a story about &quot; The New Yorker &quot; , a quick story .
And I was amazed that I was surprised to see the most effective environmental impact of the public health in history .
I didn &apos;t know what was doing , so I wrote a story about it , and I was going to go further .
a little bit later , I wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
Again , this is the same time , but this time this time ,
People were mad .
So , I also wrote a story about this , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; <unk> &quot; , why they thought it was based on molecules on a <unk> , rather than a random way of life .
But , you know , you know , I &apos;m doing what I &apos;m doing . I wrote a story , and I was as a journalist , and I &apos;m as a journalist , we &apos;re going to be doing it , we &apos;re going to eat it , we &apos;re going to eat it , and that &apos;s that .
But these stories kept me engaged , but I couldn &apos;t figure out why , but eventually .
And it &apos;s because the <unk> that made me crazy , actually , completely no <unk> .
They were <unk> , well educated , well .
like the people in this room .
And it was just that that sort of thing me so <unk>
But then I thought , you know , you know , let &apos;s be honest , let &apos;s be honest , we have come in this world that we have no longer the same ratio as a <unk> .
We talk about <unk> .
We speak ironic about being a <unk> .
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
Okay , well , there are reasons why I think we &apos;re familiar with them .
We are losing our faith in institutions , in authority , and occasionally , and there &apos;s no reason why not .
You just have to take a few names and understand the people .
Chernobyl , <unk> , the Challenger , <unk> , weapons of mass destruction , not good <unk> punch cards ,
I mean , I mean , you can actually assemble your list .
There are questions and problems with those people we thought they were always right .
So be skeptical .
Let &apos;s ask questions , ask evidence and evidence , don &apos;t go to mind .
But now , it &apos;s the point : if you have evidence , you have to hire them , and that &apos;s not so good .
And the reason that I can say is that we can say that we now are now in an attempt to live <unk> life , and that we hope that it &apos;s going to be as fast as possible .
About 12 years ago , it was published a terribly story , which was a link between the epidemic of autism and the <unk> against measles , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> .
In fact , there were lots of studies going to go to see this .
And that was also , it was a serious issue .
The data came out .
They were found in the United States , in Sweden , in Sweden , in Canada , and all the same result , not least , not least .
But it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t matter because we rely on anecdotes , we believe what we see and what we think is to see what we think we really think of ,
We can &apos;t really honor a lot of paper and a lot of paper engineers that provide us with data and I can come up with this , and I think we all can all be able to do that .
But you know what ?
The consequences are catastrophic , disastrous , and all of this : The United States is one of the most recent countries that are going to reduce the number of vaccines against the measles .
That &apos;s a shame , and we should be ashamed .
It &apos;s terrible .
What is it going to happen to us that we could make that ?
Now , I understand it . I understand it .
Who &apos;s got measles ?
Anybody of this audience will ever die of this audience ?
not often .
And this is not even true , but it occurred to last year last year .
That &apos;s a lot of deaths by measles , 20 to an hour .
But because it &apos;s not going to be able to do the <unk> , and people like Jenny <unk> are coming away from fear of fear of fear of fear of fear of fear and Larry King .
And they can do that because they can &apos;t distinguish between the causes of diffusion and accidental <unk> of conditions .
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but they &apos;re never really really .
And that &apos;s something we need to learn and we need to learn to quickly .
This guy was a hero , Jonas <unk> .
He <unk> our lives of one of our worst .
No fear , no more <unk> . Polio , <unk> !
That &apos;s the guy in the middle , too .
He &apos;s called Paul <unk> .
He developed a vaccine against the <unk> with some other people .
It saved the lives of about 400,000 to 500,000 children in the third world .
Alright , right ?
Well it &apos;s good , except that &apos;s when Paul <unk> <unk> on vaccines and how valuable they are .
and that people should stop it from <unk> .
And so he says that it &apos;s also .
So this is a terrorist a terrorist .
And if he likes to have a public talk , it &apos;s just in the company of <unk> .
He gets up to house phone calls , because there are people who are willing to tell him where his children are <unk> .
And why ? Because Paul has developed a vaccine developed .
I don &apos;t need to say , but vaccines are <unk> .
Let &apos;s take them away and get the diseases come back , horrible diseases , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen .
We have this country back in this country .
And it gets worse soon , soon going to get kids going to die when they get enough of the disease .
And they &apos;re not just about the measles .
What is polio ? That &apos;s why not ?
A former <unk> wrote me back a few weeks ago , and she said that she found me some <unk> <unk> .
No one made me ever say .
She didn &apos;t go to the child with polio .
in no case .
All right .
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio anymore . And you know what ?
Yesterday , polio came up to this .
But , who knows this morning , maybe someone came up on an airplane in Lagos , and he goes to go to go to go to Ohio .
And within a few hours , he lands , <unk> a car and goes to Long Beach , where he &apos;s going to go to one of those great <unk> .
And he doesn &apos;t realize he &apos;s contaminated with a curable disease , and we don &apos;t even know that that &apos;s going to .
That &apos;s the planet that we live there . There &apos;s no <unk> .
We prefer to be <unk> in lies . That &apos;s what we love .
Does everybody have any <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> , a little bit of <unk> to the day ?
I know it &apos;s because half of Americans do it every day .
They take it off and they use alternative drugs , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we &apos;re discovering that they are worthless .
The data goes back to it again .
They make your urine darker , and almost never .
In fact , if you want to spend 28 billion dollars for the darker urine , this is what it &apos;s like .
Dark urine ; <unk> .
Why are we doing it ? Why do we do that ? I think I understand it , we hate Big <unk> .
We hate the government . We mistrust that <unk> .
That &apos;s also to . Our <unk> are crap .
They are that for millions of our <unk> .
They are amazing <unk> and <unk> even for those who can afford them .
So we go away from there , and where do we go ?
We hop in the poor of the Big Bang .
That &apos;s great . I love Big placebo .
But , you know , this is a lot of stuff because this whole thing is crap , and we give billions of dollars .
I brought this some of those things here ,
<unk> , deception , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , I don &apos;t even know what that is , but we give billions of dollars .
And you know what ? If I want to tell you the people to call it to me , and they say , &quot; What is it ? &quot;
They feel good . &quot;
And you know what ? You &apos;re wrong .
Because it doesn &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that says , &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to give a sense of what my experts tell about the <unk> . &quot;
or any of the patients who want to treat his patients with <unk> .
And if you start with evidence and to replace science with belief , it &apos;s going to end you where you don &apos;t want to get true .
And then you end up in the South Africa of <unk> <unk> .
He &apos;s responsible for 400,000 died of his people by saying that <unk> , <unk> and <unk> were more effective than the <unk> means that can slow the deal of AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that has many different strains of <unk> in this disease .
Don &apos;t tell me that these things have no impact .
They have them . They have always got them .
Now this is the most dramatic epidemic in which we now are right now , the absurd struggle between the <unk> <unk> of genetically engineered food .
It &apos;s an idiot . It &apos;s supposed to stop .
It &apos;s about words , metaphors .
It &apos;s ideology , no science .
Everything that we eat , every <unk> rice rice , every <unk> <unk> , every <unk> <unk> , has changed by the people .
Remember , in the &quot; <unk> paradise &quot; were no <unk> .
There was no watermelon .
Even not even <unk> . They all come from us .
We created them in the last 11,000 years .
Some of those products stayed up , and people didn &apos;t .
We <unk> out of what doesn &apos;t <unk> us .
Now we can do that in a more focused way .
And certainly , there are risks attached to that .
But we can produce rice , which is able to grow millions of healthier and live longer lives .
You don &apos;t want ?
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand .
We don &apos;t want to genetically modified food .
And why ?
Well , this is the whole time , too : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , <unk> , we don &apos;t want giant fields to the same crop , right ?
We don &apos;t like companies that take patents on living things .
We don &apos;t want companies to own property rights .
And you know what I &apos;m saying ?
You have right . Let &apos;s do something .
It &apos;s true . Our <unk> are overwhelming , but it &apos;s not science .
It doesn &apos;t have any <unk> with science .
This is about laws , morality , morality .
Science is not a society .
No country .
Even not a concept ; it &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works sometimes , and sometimes it &apos;s not .
But the idea that we have to stop the science of doing her work , because we &apos;re really afraid of doing it , and it &apos;s going to be millions of people going to have to come up with any prosperity .
You know , in the next 50 years , we will need to have 70 percent more food than today .
Seventy percent .
This chart is this chart of the investment in Africa for over the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
They really need it , and we &apos;re going to remember it .
And the reason ? <unk> <unk> food .
We don &apos;t want to use people like <unk> food as a <unk> , for example .
<unk> is this every day of four billion people ; it looks like potatoes .
It &apos;s just a lot of calories . <unk> .
It contains virtually no food like proteins , and scientists are doing it to work .
so that people can eat it without being blind .
They wouldn &apos;t be starving , and you know what ?
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be a <unk> <unk> , but it would be nice .
And all that what I have to say is this : Why are we doing it ?
I mean , let &apos;s say , why are we going to ?
Because we don &apos;t want to push with genes ?
This is about to transmit from genes . Nothing to do with chemicals .
not with our ridiculous passion for hormones , our demand for more , better and <unk> food .
It &apos;s not about Rice <unk> , it &apos;s about people in life .
and it &apos;s about to understand what that means .
Because , you know , you know what ?
And if we don &apos;t do it , if we &apos;re not going to be doing it , we are guilty of something we don &apos;t want to be guilty of : High-Tech colonialism .
I don &apos;t think this is a way to describe this much .
It &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , our <unk> , and we need to really do something about it .
So after this , after this , you might be able to say , &quot; You &apos;d like to say , &quot; You &apos;d like to go to this ridiculous time , you &apos;d like to go to this ridiculous time ? &quot;
Absolutely .
Now they &apos;re still in the present , but we have an amazing chance .
We can do that time we want to use everything we want to use .
We can bring them to a future we want to go to a future we want to go to , and we &apos;re going to go to it to wherever we want to .
We need to continue this <unk> and we need to keep thinking , but if we go forward , we &apos;ll be happy that we &apos;ve done it .
I know that we can do it , and that &apos;s , for me , for what &apos;s needed to be able to know the world .
Thank you .
Thank you .
A <unk> from the Los Angeles Times ...
Steve <unk> , on one day ...
by the center of Los Angeles ...
when he heard this wonderful music ?
That came from a man .
a black man .
<unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> played on a violin , but two strings .
Let me tell you something many of you know ...
because the columns of Steve were formed ,
for a book that was made a movie .
Robert <unk> <unk> plays the role of Steve <unk>
Jamie <unk> that from <unk> Anthony <unk>
the classic educated <unk> ...
who had his eyes to tear down his eyes
because he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia .
<unk> stopped with the <unk> , collapsed ,
and 30 years later , he was homeless .
by the poorest streets of Los Angeles .
You should read Steve &apos;s book or see the movie .
not just for the wonderful connection ...
that was born between those two men .
But also to see the role of music ,
a <unk> role , if I like that ,

I met <unk> in 2008 ...
Two years ago , in a <unk> .
He was listening to the performance of the first and <unk> symphony of Beethoven
And it came back and suggested .
He was talking about a <unk> and social way .
about <unk> and Hillary Clinton ,
<unk> said that the <unk> never would ever go into the world .
all of this to the end of a <unk> <unk>
in the last part of the fourth symphony of music .
We spoke about music . Later I got an email from Steve
who wrote that <unk> would just like to have a <unk> of mine .
You have to know that <unk> doesn &apos;t want to be treated .
When he was treated , he was getting <unk>
<unk> and <unk> ...
and this has signed his life .
The result is that he &apos;s now ...
<unk> of schizophrenia .
During the worst attacks ,
<unk> ...
and he goes away for days .
He was <unk> over the street ,
and it lives with that <unk> and the disorder of his head

<unk> was in such a <unk> state ...
when we first started our first lesson .
He had a <unk> glow in his eyes .
He was lost .
He was talking about ...
invisible demons and smoke
and someone who was trying to poison him in his sleep .
I was scared .
not for myself , I was scared
that I would lose him ...
he would put it into such a <unk>
and I would ruin his relationship with the violin ,
when I first started talking about <unk> ...
And <unk> &apos;s and other exciting examples ,
of what you learn from <unk> .
So I started playing .
I played the first part of the <unk> of Beethoven .
As I played ,
I saw a clear change --
in the eyes of <unk> .
It was as if an invisible drug did work .
a chemical reaction to my game ,
the catalyst was
The <unk> excitement of <unk>

in silent curiosity , there &apos;s no curiosity .
When he grabbed a wonder , he grabbed his own violin --
and it started to play the ear .
Certain samples of <unk> ...
I was supposed to be able to get ready . <unk>
<unk> , <unk> .
We started talking about music , of course ,
to Beethoven and <unk>
<unk> , all the B .
from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
I saw that he &apos;s not just ...
a musical instrument --
but it was personally affected by the music .
He was talking about the same passion
and the same thing as I know and my colleagues ,
from the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
By making music , to talk to music ,
what this guy has changed ...
of the paranoid , <unk> man ...
which is directly from the streets ...
from Los Angeles ...
in a <unk> , <unk> ...
brilliant , classical <unk> musicians ,
Music is healing , it changes us .
For <unk> music , music is a healthy mind .
With music he can be his thoughts
and <unk> ,
through his imagination and creativity
In reality .
That &apos;s how he <unk> .
are <unk> attacks .
I saw that that &apos;s the nature of art .
That &apos;s why we make music .
That &apos;s what we take to take something all this --
deep in our core .
Our emotions .
And that &apos;s our artistic lens ,
that can warp emotions to reality ,
The reality of expression ...
all right .
We are being inspired and united .
<unk>
came from a group of friends back .
The <unk> force came back to him
in a family of musicians
who understood it ...
those are the traits ...

I will always make music with <unk> .
whether it &apos;s in Walt Disney Hall ,
or on the street .
I have become a musician .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Robert <unk> .
I want to play a game that I have stolen from <unk> .
Please forgive me .
I &apos;m Jane <unk> . I &apos;m a game designer .
For about 10 years , I make online video games .
And my goal for the next decade , is to be able to go to the world to save the world in real life , like it &apos;s in games .
Now , I &apos;m going to have a plan for this , and this plan is to be more people , you know , you all included more , you know , to try to spend more time on the play of bigger and better games .
At this moment , we play three billion hours a week online .
Some of you probably think , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to play games . &quot;
Perhaps too much time , because there are so many major problems in the world that are going to be there .
But actually , it turns out , I think that at the end of my research at the Institute for the Institute for The <unk> , which is the opposite .
Three billion hours a week is not enough to solve the world &apos;s problems .
In fact , I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we want to raise that that &apos;s going to increase that number a lot .
I &apos;ve calculated that we need in the entire 21 billion hours of <unk> per week .
That &apos;s probably a strange idea , so I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;m going to <unk> it .
If we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , obesity , faith , believe that we should try to play a week of 21 billion hours of online games .
This is the talk , this is the way that this is pretty good for the future of games that are so important for the future survival of humanity .
This is a portrait by a photographer , <unk> <unk> .
He was going to collect the emotion of video games .
So he put a camera on gamers as they played .
And this is a classic emotion with gaming .
Now , if you &apos;re not a gamer , you probably miss some nuances in this picture .
You probably see the feeling of pressure , a little bit of fear , but also intense concentration , a deep focus , to solve a very hard problem .
If you &apos;re a gamer , you &apos;ll notice some of those nuances : the <unk> around the eyes and the mouth is a sign of optimism .
The eyebrows coming up to be a sign of surprise .
This is a gamer that is about the point of something called a <unk> win .
Ah , you know , you know . Okay , good .
So we have some gamers among us .
A &quot; <unk> win &quot; is a result that is so unbelievably positive , that you could not know that it was possible until you reach it .
It was almost not to imagine .
And when you &apos;re there , you &apos;re surprised to discover what you can really . That &apos;s a <unk> win .
This is a gamer at the point of trying to get a <unk> win .
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of <unk> over the world as we try to address the barriers of the next century .
The face of someone who , against all odds , is to reach a <unk> win .
But unfortunately , we have seen this face in everyday life , while we &apos;re trying to address pressing this pressing problems .
This is what I call &quot; I &apos;m not supposed to be good in the life . &quot;
And this is me actually doing this . Can you see it ? Yes . All right .
This is me that I &apos;m doing it &quot; I don &apos;t make you good . &quot;
This is a wonderful graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley , California , where I was doing my Ph.D in games than in real life .
And this is a problem that many gamers have .
We feel that we &apos;re not even good at the reality as we are in games .
And I mean , with not only good luck , it doesn &apos;t matter any part of it .
We can get more in games . But I mean , I mean , I mean , well , I mean , well , I mean , well , I mean , well , I mean , I &apos;m motivated to do something that counts , inspired to work together .
And when we &apos;re in a game world , I believe that most of us are going to become the best version of ourselves , the most likely they are the most likely to help us .
the most likely that if it &apos;s necessary for the most likely one to continue to stay with a problem for a failure .
And if we live in the real life of a failure of life , when we face it , we often don &apos;t feel like that .
We feel overwhelmed . We feel overwhelmed .
We feel fear anxious , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
We never have those feelings when we play games .
they just don &apos;t exist in games .
So that &apos;s what I was trying to study when I was a student .
What part of games doesn &apos;t allow us to feel like we can &apos;t do anything ?
How can we take those feelings of games and apply it to work in the real world ?
So , I was watching games like this , like , of course , like Hey Warcraft , that &apos;s really the ideal cooperative environment to solve problems .
And I started to realize some of those things that win the &quot; Blind gewinnen &quot; in the online world .
The first thing I noticed is that every time you come to one of those online games , mainly World of Warcraft , there are very many different characters that you &apos;d like to put on a <unk> mission that you &apos;d like to put on a <unk> mission , right ?
But not just a mission , a mission that is perfectly adapted to your level of your level . Right ?
So , you can do it .
They never give you a challenge to you .
But it &apos;s the limits of your ability . So you have to try hard .
But there &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft .
You can &apos;t sit down somewhere .
There &apos;s always something specific and important important that should be done .
And there are also very much <unk> .
Each place where you go , there are hundreds of thousands of people who are willing to help you out your epic mission .
That &apos;s something that we have really hard time in the real life , which is that there are very many collaborators .
And it &apos;s also a <unk> story , this inspirational story that tells us why we are here and what we &apos;re doing here .
And then all the positive feedback that we get .
You &apos;ve heard of a level of <unk> and <unk> strength , and <unk> intelligence .
Sun &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is not getting in the real life .
When I &apos;m here of this stage of this stage , I won &apos;t get a text message from <unk> , <unk> idea , <unk> idea .
Such a feedback that I don &apos;t get in the real life .
Now , the problem with collaborative worlds like World of Warcraft , like World of Warcraft , is that it &apos;s so much time at the end of a <unk> win , which is that we spend all of our time doing this online game .
It &apos;s just better than reality .
Up until now , World of Warcraft has been spent , all together , <unk> million years later , to solve the virtual problems of <unk> &apos;s problems .
Now , that &apos;s not necessarily something just .
It may sound bad .
Just to make that clear : <unk> million years ago , our first human flight was our first human race .
That was the first one , <unk> primates .
Okay , so if we talk about the amount of time we &apos;re investing in games of games , it &apos;s the only way to think about it , well , it &apos;s just about thinking about time in the context of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
But it &apos;s also appropriate , because it turns out that we spend so much time with game of games , but we can change what we are doing when humans are capable .
We &apos;re evolving to a species which is cooperative and genuine .
This is true . I believe this .
So , think about this interesting number .
It was recently published by a researcher named Carnegie Mellon University .
The average young person today , in a country with a major game of culture , will have spent 10,000 hours of culture , for the time that he &apos;s 21 years old .
Now , 10,000 hours , a very interesting number for two reasons .
The first one , for children in the United States , is the exact amount of time that you ever go to school at the age of five and the age of five <unk> until you &apos;re ever present .
So , we have a <unk> ongoing job of education where kids learn a lot about how they &apos;re doing all the rest in school .
Some of you probably &apos;ve read <unk> &apos;s book <unk> &apos;s book .
So you probably heard of his <unk> , the 10,000 hours of <unk> .
It &apos;s this wonderful , cognitive scientific research based on that if we can actually control for 10,000 hours long study at least if we &apos;re going to be 21 , we &apos;re going to <unk> .
We will be good at what we &apos;re doing as the best of the world .
And so , what we &apos;re seeing now is a whole generation of young kids who are <unk> in gaming .
So , the big question is , &quot; Where are gamers so good ? &quot;
Because if we can go back to this , we have a virtual <unk> of human potential .
This is the number of people that are currently playing at least one hour a day playing video games .
These are our <unk> .
500 million people that are exceptional in something .
And in the next decade , we &apos;ll still have a billion gamers that are going to be extremely good at .
And if you don &apos;t know , this is what this is .
The <unk> is <unk> on the developing world that need a lot of stream and wireless <unk> instead of using <unk> Internet tools , especially in India , in India , in India , in India , China and Brazil , online .
They expect one billion gamers to say more to the next decade .
That brings us to 1.5 billion gamers .
So , I was wondering , I was going to be doing these kinds of games such as these kinds of games .
I &apos;ve found four things . The first one is <unk> optimism .
Okay . This is what you can see as extreme <unk> .
<unk> optimism is the first to go to <unk> to address a hurdle , combined with the belief that we have a reasonable chance of success .
<unk> always believe that a <unk> win is possible , and it &apos;s always worth it to try to try and try to .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> in the <unk> of a dense social substance .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that turns out that we prefer people to play a game with them , even though they have all the time .
The reason is that you need trust with someone to play a game .
We trust it that they will spend time with our time , that they &apos;ll be able to play the same set of rules , that they &apos;re going to go to the same purpose , which is the same thing .
So a game play with someone who is doing the bond , the trust and the cooperation .
And as a result , we &apos;re actually building stronger social ties
<unk> productivity . Awesome .
You know , there &apos;s a reason that the average World of Warcraft comes to 22 hours a week , almost like a <unk> profession .
That &apos;s because we know that when we play a game , we are actually happier to work that we &apos;re sort of relaxing or somewhere around .
We know that we humans are making hard work to deliver , useful work .
And gamers are always hard to work when they get the right work .
And in the end , epic meaning .
<unk> are like <unk> on <unk> missions , on stories of planetary levels .
So , a little bit of <unk> to make this clearer .
You all know about Wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
The second largest wiki in the world , with nearly 80,000 articles , is the World of Warcraft .
Five million people use it every month .
They have more <unk> over World of Warcraft with the Internet as well as any other subject result in a different way .
They build a <unk> story .
They build a <unk> source of knowledge about World of Warcraft .
Okay , so those are four of new superpowers to be combined into one thing .
<unk> are <unk> , hopeful .
These are people who believe that they can uniquely change the world around the world .
And the only one problem is that they believe that they can transform virtual worlds , and not the real world .
That &apos;s the problem that I try to solve .
There &apos;s a economist , Edward <unk> .
His work is brilliant . He seeks the reason to spend so much time and energy and money on online worlds .
And he says , &quot; We are no witnesses whatsoever to virtual worlds to virtual worlds and online <unk> . &quot;
And it &apos;s a economist , it &apos;s rational .
And he says ... not like me , I &apos;m a game designer ; I &apos;m <unk> .
But he says that this is perfectly fine , because gamers can achieve more in a online world than in the real life .
They can have stronger social ties in games than in real life .
They get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than actually .
So he says that it &apos;s perfectly fine makes more sense that gamers spend more time in virtual worlds than in the real world .
Now , I also agree that that &apos;s rational , right , right ?
But it &apos;s not an optimum situation .
We have to look into the world more like a game .
So I take my inspiration from something that 2,500 years ago .
These are ancient dictionaries made of <unk> . Okay ?
For that we had some cool controllers , we had <unk> .
And this is the first prototype that serves to play , designed by people .
And if you know how to work from the old Greek historian <unk> , you may have known this story .
the inventors of the first game .
<unk> says that games , especially those who are <unk> , were invented in the Kingdom of <unk> over a famine .
Apparently , the famine was so bad that the king of <unk> decided to do something <unk> .
People <unk> . People <unk> .
It was a extreme situation . They needed to find an extreme solution .
So , <unk> <unk> , they came to <unk> and put a <unk> on it .
One day , everybody eats it .
The next day , everybody plays games .
And they would be immersed in such a game , because play are so interesting , and <unk> us under that <unk> productivity , that they would not have any food .
The next day , they played games .
The day after they ate every day .
And according to <unk> , they loved this 18 years .
they survived a famine so they survived a famine day and the next day .
Now , I think this is exactly how we use games today .
We use games to escape the suffering of the real world .
We use them to escape from everything that is broken in the real world , all the things that are not fulfilling to live in the real life , and we get what we need games .
But that doesn &apos;t have to end up there .
This is very exciting .
After 18 years , according to 18 years old , I think it &apos;s not better .
So the king decided to go one final <unk> would play .
They shared the whole kingdom in two
They played one <unk> , and the winners of that game could be on a <unk> adventure .
They would leave you <unk> , and look at a new city .
just enough people kept dying from food that were still , and hopefully they could be able to grow civilization somewhere else .
Now this sounds crazy , right ?
But recently , DNA evidence has evidence that the <unk> that would lead to the <unk> rich , the same DNA , have the same DNA .
And so scientists have suggested that there &apos;s an amazing story that was true .
And geologists have found evidence of a climate change that would explain that almost 20 years .
So this crazy story could be true .
It could be that they could have saved their culture by play by games , to go to a game for 18 years , and so inspired by the way that it was going to save their whole civilization , they were able to save their whole civilization .
Okay , we can also .
We play Warcraft since 1994 .
It was the first real game of the World of Warcraft of the World of Warcraft . That was 16 years ago .
They played over 18 years , they played over the course of 18 years ,
Let me say that we are ready for our own epic game .
Now , they had half the population looking for a new world .
So that &apos;s where I spend my 21 billion hours of <unk> per week .
We &apos;ll leave half of our akkoord to play an hour a day to solve problems in the world .
Now , I know what you &apos;re wondering , &quot; How are we going to solve those problems ? &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing with the last couple of years , at the Institute for the last couple of years .
We have an impact on our building in our building in Palo Alto , and it &apos;s going to tell us how to deal with the future .
We don &apos;t want to predict it .
We want to form it .
We want to imagine the best possible outcome .
And then we want to give people the power to make reality .
We want to see our &quot; <unk> wins &quot; , and then people give to the resources to achieve their <unk> win .
I &apos;m going to show you just three games that I &apos;ve made , which is an attempt to give people the resources to create their own &quot; Blind <unk> &quot; in the future .
Okay , this is the world without oil .
We did this game in 2007 .
This is an online game where you try to survive oil .
The deficit is <unk> , but we spend enough information in there to show you that it &apos;s really , and to live your lives , if you don &apos;t have any oil anymore . So , if you start off the game , you start telling you your life .
And then we put your <unk> and <unk> data that &apos;s what &apos;s the exact price of oil , which is not available , how the <unk> are affected , how the <unk> are affected , or the schools are being made .
And you have to figure out how to live your life as if this was true . And then we ask you to go to a blog and post it to write some blog and photographs .
We started this game with <unk> players in 2007 .
And we followed them for three years since .
And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
No one wants to change his lifestyle , but it &apos;s good for the world or because it should be good for us .
But if you put them in a <unk> adventure and it tells them , &quot; We have no oil anymore . &quot;
This is an amazing story and adventure to go .
<unk> yourself to see how to survive .
And most of the players liked their own their practices in this game .
So , for example , for the next <unk> game , we decided to aim for more , larger problems than a oil spill .
We created a game called <unk> at the Institute for The <unk> .
The plot was able to calculated a supercomputer only 23 years ago on Earth .
This supercomputer had a name called Global <unk> System <unk> System .
We asked people to get online , almost like a Jerry <unk> movie .
You know , you know , Jerry <unk> movies , you make a dream .
You have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> , and they have to save the world .
But in our game , we have , instead of five people on the <unk> team , everybody on the <unk> team , and it &apos;s your job to find the future of energy of energy , the future of food , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of social media .
We carried 8,000 people around the game for eight weeks .
They came up with 500 creative solutions that you can see when you can see on Google &apos; <unk> .
And then finally , the last game , we &apos;ll take it from the March three March -- this game is created in collaboration with the World Bank called The World Bank Institute .
And if you go to the game , you &apos;ll be certified by the world , you &apos;ll be certified by the World Bank system , as a social media company in 2010 .
<unk> with universities across the very first sub-Saharan Africa , and we invited them to teach them social innovation .
We have a <unk> . We have a system with levels of skills like local insight , knowledge , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
I &apos;d like to invite you all this game to share this game with young kids , anywhere in the world , especially in <unk> , that could take advantage of the benefit of the meeting , to save their own social endeavors to the world .
So I &apos;m going to end .
I want to ask a question .
What is it going to happen ?
We all have these amazing gamers , we have these games that are the ideas of what we could do , but none of them have saved the world .
Well , I hope that your chord is going to be with me , that gamers are a human resource , which we can use to help the real world , that games are a powerful platform for change .
We have all these fantastic superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to <unk> a dense , social fabric , this sense of <unk> optimism , this sense of <unk> optimism and desire for a epic meaning .
I really hope that we can get together to play games to play a difference , to survive on this planet in a planet .
And my hope is that you &apos;re going to join me and play games like this .
And if I look forward to the next decade , I know two things : that we can make every future we can imagine , and we can be able to play every game we want to play .
So , I &apos;m saying , let &apos;s play the <unk> game .
Thank you .
Since time , I was interested in the <unk> .
That may seem strange to be a magician , unless you have the same meaning as I , that it &apos;s something that is fake , so that it &apos;s something that is fake , so that it &apos;s really , really , a <unk> effect , <unk> have a measurable effect on certain studies : the <unk> effect .
Just because the person in question thinks that what it does is it &apos;s a <unk> tool or something else --
In terms of dealing with pain , for example , for example , if you believe that , if you believe that it &apos;s an measurable physical effect , it &apos;s measurable .
Something that is fake , really , really , because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
To make sure we understand each other , I want to show you a very simple <unk> .
And I &apos;ll show you how it works -- this trick is to find out in the &apos; 50s for the &apos; 50s in every time for children .
I learned him as a young boy in the 1970s in the 1970s .
I &apos;m going to do the trick , then I &apos;ll explain it .
And then I explain why I explained it .
This is what happens .
The knife , you can see , my hand , my hand , you can see .
I &apos;m going to hold this blade in this way ,
I &apos;m going to take my sleeve a little bit .
And to make sure that there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , I &apos;ll put it into my sleeve .
That &apos;s how you can see that there &apos;s no movement .
For that long , I can <unk> here , there can &apos;t come from my sleeve .
The goal is very simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if it &apos;s good , it &apos;s going to have the knife going to the knife .
The knife is even so solid , I can shake it and shake it , and it doesn &apos;t fall on the ground .
Nothing comes out of my sleeve , no deception . And you can observe everything accurately .
<unk> !
Now , this trick , I &apos;m often teaching kids to be interested in young kids , because you can see a lot of learning about deception .
Even though the trick is very simple .
Probably many of you know this trick .
This is what happens .
I hold it in my hand .
I &apos;m saying that I <unk> my wrist , to make sure that there &apos;s nothing inside and out of my sleeve .
That &apos;s lying .
The reason I <unk> my wrist is because it &apos;s the secret of the illusion .
At the moment that my hand is going to turn away from your view , my <unk> of its original place goes to one where it &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; Nice trick . &quot; Somebody who didn &apos;t have a youth , sit in the room .
So this is how it goes .
And when I split it , my finger travels .
We can talk about it , why this thing is this thing , why you don &apos;t notice that there are three fingers visible there .
That &apos;s because the brain processes information on a way that doesn &apos;t matter , two , three count , but <unk> .
But that &apos;s not really about , right ? And I &apos;m going to open my hand .
Of course , the knife doesn &apos;t depend on magnetism but through deception , through the presence of my <unk> .
And when I split my hand , the same thing .
And if I <unk> myself again , this movement allows me to go back to my finger to <unk> .
I &apos;m going to take this hand away . You can take a knife .
A nice trick that you can do for friends and family . Thank you .
Now , what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
About a year ago , I was reading a research that was completely open the eyes of my eyes .
I &apos;m not a scientist , so this was amazing .
It turns out that if you give a placebo in the form of a white round pill that looks like a <unk> effect , it has a certain measurable effect .
Make it , if the form of placebo changes , for example , for example , by making a smaller pill , which is going to be blue , and then you can then push a letter to a set of <unk> .
Despite the fact that neither of these changes in terms of any of the changes in terms of mind are <unk> .
But a white pill is not as good as a blue one .
What ? That &apos;s what ?
But it turns out , it &apos;s the <unk> .
But it turns out that in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , that &apos;s more effective than any of those kinds of patterns .
A colored capsule , yellow on one and red on the other side , is better than a white one .
<unk> play plays a role .
A pill twice every day is not as good as three <unk> , I can &apos;t remember the statistics , sorry .
But the point is ...
<unk> play a role .
And the shape plays a role .
And for the ultimate <unk> , we have to go to the needle .
Yes , right ? It &apos;s a <unk> with some sort of <unk> of some kind of <unk> of some kind of <unk> that you put in a patient ...
This is a huge powerful image in his mind .
It &apos;s many times stronger than the white pill .
Let &apos;s show you a graph , when we can show slides to slides .
The point is , the white pill is not as good as the blue one , it &apos;s not as good as the capsule , it &apos;s not as good as the needle .
And none of them have a real <unk> trait .
Just really your faith in your body , it creates a stronger effect .
I wanted to look at that idea in a trick .
I wanted to take something which is clear a trick , and it really acts like this .
We know that inquiry that when you want to go to reality , you have to grab the needle .
This is a <unk> of almost 18 centimeters . It &apos;s <unk> .
I &apos;m going to take her a little bit of <unk> here .
This is actually my flesh . This is not a particularly organic meat .
This is my skin . This is not a <unk> special effect .
I &apos;m going to <unk> my skin and put this needle through my arm , until I was through it .
And when you go to <unk> or <unk> , I did this trick -- I did this trick -- I didn &apos;t even know that I knew too .
One woman would almost go from her .
So , I propose that if you &apos;re <unk> , you know , if you &apos;re <unk> , you know what , I &apos;m the first heavy part of it .
You can look at , but you can look away as you want .
This is what happens .
On the bottom of my arm , I make a little hole .
I &apos;m sorry . You ?
And I &apos;m going to go through a piece of paper , and then by the other end ,
Now , in essence , we are in the same situation as we have the <unk> .
One of them .
But you can count my fingers , right ?
I &apos;m going to show them . Here &apos;s one , two , four , five .
Yeah ?
I know people like seeing this .
They &apos;re thinking , &quot; He &apos;s not stupid enough to go to <unk> for a few minutes of entertainment . &quot; Let me give you a <unk> .
What does that look like ? Pretty good .
Yes , I know it . The people in the back room saying , okay , I didn &apos;t really see that . &apos; People in the other room are closer to the screen .
Let me show you this from nearby .
That &apos;s really my skin . That &apos;s not a <unk> .
That &apos;s my flesh . I can put that pin .
I &apos;m sorry . If it &apos;s too much , you don &apos;t go to that thing .
People back in the back of the room , when they look at the images , they &apos;ll say , &quot; That looks like a nice special effect , but if it was really , it would -- there &apos;s a hole and there . &quot; If it would be real , he &apos;s going to bleed .
Yes , there &apos;s this .
Normally , I was going to take the needle now .
I would clean my arm and show you that there are no <unk> .
But in this context , and with the idea of something that &apos;s fake , and it &apos;s making it really , I just keep the needle , and I &apos;m going to end up with the <unk> .
Over the next few days , I &apos;ll show you several times .
Hopefully , you &apos;re going to look at that . Thank you very much .
I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I have just two really .
The first one seemed to be more on a passionate <unk> .
It was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good structure , <unk> , a <unk> at the menu .
a fish .
The better yet , it was <unk> fish to the <unk> of sustainability .
So you feel good at selling .
I had a relationship with this beauty for a few months .
One day , my head called the head of the company , and asked me if I wanted to speak to an event about the <unk> of the <unk> .
&quot; Absolutely . &quot;
Here was a company that was trying to solve something that was trying to solve this incredible problem .
How do we keep fishing ?
In the last 50 years , we have the oceans in 50 years , as we <unk> forests .
It &apos;s hard to exaggerate the devastation ,
90 percent of the large fish that we love , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they have collapsed .
There &apos;s almost nothing left .
So , how well , how well is it going to matter , aquaculture , <unk> , becomes part of our future .
Although there are many arguments against this .
<unk> pollute , most of them , at least they are inefficient , tuna .
A big <unk> .
It &apos;s about 15 against one .
That means that there &apos;s 15 pounds of wild fish to get a pound of <unk> tuna .
not very sustainable .
And it doesn &apos;t really taste well .
So here was finally a company that was trying to do well .
I wanted to support them .
The day before the event called the <unk> of the company .
Let &apos;s call it Don .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; to get the facts clear , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t pollute it . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s true . &quot;
And he added up , &quot; We &apos;re actually a <unk> .
The <unk> ? 2.5 to one .
2.5 .
&quot; <unk> against one ? What are you doing ? &quot;
&quot; Sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; Awesome . &quot;
And that night , I was sitting in bed and thought , what is a sustainable protein ?
So the next day , just the event , I called Don &apos;t called Don .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t , what are you looking like ? &quot;
He said he didn &apos;t know it . He would <unk> .
So I &apos;ve been on the line with some people in the company .
No one could give me a clear answer .
until finally , I finally got the <unk> on the line .
Let &apos;s call it Don &apos;t call it .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; What are you just some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
Now , he called some algae and some <unk> , and then he said <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yes , feathers , skin , <unk> bones , <unk> , <unk> and processed to feed . &quot;
And I said , &quot; What percentage of you is chicken ? &quot;
thinking , well , two percent .
&quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Don &apos;t you take a sustainable chicken to fish ? &quot;
There was a long time on the line and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
My love was about this fish .
No , not because I &apos;m a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s me .
No , I lost my love for this fish because , I swear , after that conversation , they tasted chicken .
This second fish , this is a very different story .
It &apos;s romantic species , the species that you know more of your fish than you know more of the fish .
I first got in a restaurant in <unk> .
A <unk> journalist spoke for a long time .
It &apos;s more or less .
He came to the table , a bright orange , white color .
The nurse was drinking it .
Almost twice the time .
That &apos;s pretty good .
Who could do a fish so well after he cooked food ?
I don &apos;t , but this guy does .
Let &apos;s call it Miguel .
In fact , his name is also Miguel .
And no , he didn &apos;t drink the fish and he &apos;s not a chef .
At least not how you and I understand it .
He &apos;s a biologist in <unk> La <unk> .
That &apos;s a <unk> in the <unk> of Spain .
At the end of the <unk> river .
In fact , in the &apos; 80s was the <unk> in the hands of <unk> .
They were <unk> on what was actually <unk> .
They did that by <unk> the country .
They built a complicated <unk> , and they <unk> water from the country to the river .
It was not going to succeed , not economically .
And ecologically seen was a catastrophe .
90 percent of the birds died .
for this place , a lot of birds .
And so in 1982 , this is a liberal arts company called the land .
What did they do ?
They came to the <unk> .
They literally put the button .
Instead of pushing water into it , they used to be able to put water into the water .
They put the channels underwater .
They created a <unk> giant <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and at the same time , Miguel and his firm are the ecological devastation entirely .
The <unk> is amazing .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
And you look at the horizon that goes infinitely far away , and you see <unk> channels , and this big fat , rich swamp .
not so long ago , I was there with Miguel .
He &apos;s a great guy , he &apos;s a big batch of three and a quarter of the <unk> .
Okay ? Here are we , <unk> by the <unk> , I <unk> and <unk> , mud my knees , <unk> a <unk> .
Here it points to a rare <unk> .
Now it points to the <unk> of the phytoplankton .
And here , there &apos;s a <unk> that he sees on the <unk> <unk> .
It turns out that Miguel is the largest part of his career in the <unk> National Park in Africa .
I asked him how he has a <unk> .
He said , &quot; <unk> ? I don &apos;t know anything of fish .
I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot;
And then he was talking about this over rare birds and algae and strange <unk> .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong , it was really fascinating , a kind of biological community <unk> .
It was great , but I was in love .
And my head <unk> with the <unk> beautiful fish that I had had this evening .
So I <unk> him . I said , &quot; Miguel , what &apos;s it coming out of your fish ? &quot;
He pointed to the algae .
&quot; I know it , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , it &apos;s great .
But what &apos;s the fish ?
What is the <unk> ? &quot;
And he &apos;s going to tell me by telling you that it &apos;s such a rich system that &apos;s food that they eat in the wild .
The <unk> biomass , the phytoplankton , the animal &apos;s plankton , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to grow ?
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
There &apos;s no food .
Have you ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t run their animals ?
Later that day , I was driving over this field with Miguel and he asked him , &quot; For a place like that , you know , if you look at , &quot; How is it going to be ? &quot;
At that time , it was like a <unk> <unk> .
And we went to see the corner , and we saw the most amazing face , thousands and thousands of pink <unk> , literally a pink carpet so that you could look at .
&quot; That &apos;s a success . &quot;
&quot; Look at their <unk> , pink .
They are at the celebrations . &quot;
<unk> ? I was completely confused .
And I said , &quot; Miguel , are they not on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ! &quot;
&quot; We hit 20 percent of our fish and <unk> deaths .
In fact , this was 600,000 birds in 600,000 birds , over 250 different types .
It &apos;s now the largest and one of the most important private communities in very Europe . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Miguel , it &apos;s a <unk> that doesn &apos;t make the last thing you want to do ? &quot;
He shook his head , no .
He said , &quot; We grow <unk> , not intensely .
This is a green network .
The <unk> are the shrimp .
The shrimp food is the phytoplankton .
So how <unk> the <unk> system , the better system . &quot;
Okay , let &apos;s look at it .
A <unk> who doesn &apos;t bring it to its animals , and a <unk> that are going to measure its success from their hunters &apos;s <unk> .
A <unk> , but also a <unk> .
Oh , by the way , the <unk> , who should not be supposed to be there .
They breed in a village at 250 kilometers away , where the <unk> are better to build nests .
Each morning they fly 250 kilometers to the <unk> .
And every night they fly 250 kilometers ago .
They &apos;re doing it because they can trace the interrupted white line of the highway .
not kidding .
I introduced myself to a <unk> , so I was sitting there .
And I said , &quot; Miguel , they would go 300 kilometers to the <unk> and then at night ? &quot;
Do they do for the boy ? &quot;
He looked like I just looked like a Whitney <unk> .
He said , &quot; No . They do it to be better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t have the skin of my loved one even mentioned , which was amazing , and I don &apos;t like <unk> .
I don &apos;t like you , I don &apos;t like that . I don &apos;t like you .
It &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> taste .
I &apos;m rarely cooking .
But when I tasted it in the restaurant in <unk> , he didn &apos;t really go to <unk> .
He tasted sweet and clean clean of the ocean .
And I was saying that against Miguel and <unk> .
He said , &quot; The skin works like a <unk> .
It &apos;s the last defense thing before the body enters the body .
He has evolved to suck up <unk> . &quot;
And then he added up , &quot; But our water doesn &apos;t have any <unk> . &quot;
Okay . A <unk> who doesn &apos;t work .
A <unk> that are going to measure its success at the success of its predators .
And then I realized that when he said , there was a <unk> that didn &apos;t have a <unk> , it made a big <unk> , because the water that flows out of the <unk> river .
That &apos;s a river that comes out of everything with the current present , chemical <unk> , pesticide use .
And it &apos;s when it comes to the system of <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s the water <unk> than it was inside .
The system is so healthy that it <unk> the water .
So not just a <unk> that doesn &apos;t include their animals , not just a <unk> that are the health of its predators , but a <unk> that &apos;s literally a <unk> .
And not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
Because when the water goes out , it &apos;s going to come out in the Atlantic Ocean .
A drop in the ocean , I know it , but I take it , and you should also , because this love story , although romantic , is also <unk> .
You can say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or cattle .
What we need now is a <unk> new <unk> , one where the food actually tastes good .
But for many people , it &apos;s too radical .
We are not <unk> , we <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We love <unk> .
We love little <unk> .
We talk about local food .
We eat organic .
And if you suggest that these things are the things that make the future of good food , it &apos;s always someone on and says , &quot; Hey , I love pink <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
How are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
Can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t like that question .
No , not because we have already producing more than enough <unk> to feed the world .
One billion people is hungry .
One billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the major inequality of distribution , not the amount .
I don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s determined by the logic of our food system of over the last 50 years .
<unk> grains of <unk> , pesticides on <unk> , chemicals on soil , and the whole of agribusiness was just asked , &quot; If we feed more people cheaper , how could we feed more people cheaper ? &quot;
That &apos;s the motivation .
It &apos;s the <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> of the American <unk> .
We should call it what it is , a corporation in <unk> , a firm that is corrosive to ecological capital , which is the production of how to make it possible .
That &apos;s not business and it &apos;s not a <unk> .
Our everyday bread is now threatened , not due to declining supply , but through declining sources , not by the last <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile water , not by pumps , but by clean water , not by water , but through <unk> and nets , but by the sea in the sea .
Do you want to feed the world ?
Let &apos;s start with the question : How are we going to feed ourselves ?
Or better , how can we create conditions that can feed itself ?
To do that , look , look at the <unk> for the future .
It &apos;s old and it &apos;s <unk> .
It leans over money , and it &apos;s the machines and machines , and it &apos;s never really good for food .
Let &apos;s look at that in the ecological model .
That &apos;s the model that is grounded in two billion years ago .
Now look at Miguel , <unk> like Miguel , <unk> who are not their own <unk> and <unk> making <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> the <unk> , but experts in relationships , but experts in relationships , because they &apos;re experts in flavors .
And if I &apos;m very honest , they are a better chef than I ever will be .
You know , I think it &apos;s fine , because if the future of good food is , it &apos;s going to be lovely .
Thank you .
I grew up , on a constant diet of science fiction .
In the course of secondary school , I went to school to school , went to school for an hour , every day .
And I was always absorbed by a book , a science fiction book , a science fiction book , that would bring me into other worlds , and that , in <unk> sense , my <unk> curiosity .
And , you know , you know , that curiosity <unk> is also the fact that I was , when I was not at school , I was in the forest , <unk> and monsters , frogs , snakes , insects , and they took back into the microscope .
You know , I was a real <unk> .
But it all was all about understanding the world , the limits of the potential of understanding .
And my love for science fiction seemed to become a <unk> in the world around me , because what happened , this was the end of the <unk> years , we went to the moon , we came to the moon , we went to see the deep oceans in the world , that would have been able to see our animals and <unk> that we never had imagined .
This seemed like <unk> with the whole Science fiction .
And I was an artist .
I could draw . I could draw painting .
And because there were no video games , and this <unk> of <unk> movies , and all of these images in the media , I had to create these images in my mind .
You know , that we all had to all have to read , if kids were reading a book and based on the description of the author , put it on the way that we put it into our heads .
And my response to this was , painting , painting , alien creatures , alien worlds , <unk> , all sorts of things .
I was constantly caught in <unk> <unk> .
That was the creativity that had to find a way to find out .
And something interesting happened , the Jacques Cousteau &apos;s programs , they made me very excited about the fact that there was a alien world , just here on Earth .
I would probably not really go to a <unk> world like a <unk> <unk> .
That seemed pretty unlikely .
But that was a world that I could actually just go to this Earth , which was so rich and exotic , that was so rich and exotic , if it was reading the books .
So , I decided to become a diver at 15 years old .
And the one problem with that was that I lived in a small village in Canada , 600 miles of the nearest ocean .
But I didn &apos;t have to leave that <unk> .
I <unk> my father until he finally found a <unk> in Buffalo , New York , just over the border of where we lived ,
And I came up with my certificate , in a pool of a pool of a <unk> center , middle of the winter , in Buffalo , New York .
And I saw the ocean , a ocean , not until two years later , when we moved to California .
Since then , in the <unk> 40 years , I was spending about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in subs .
And I &apos;ve learned that the deep sea floor , and even the shallow oceans , so rich with amazing life , is that it &apos;s really our imagination .
The imagination of nature is such as limitless , compared to our limited , human imagination .
Until this day , I have a great awe for what I see in these dives .
And my continuous love for the ocean is still as much as she was ever .
But when I was an adult , a career was this filmmaker .
And that seemed the best way to have this urge to tell me stories , with my desire to create images .
And as a child , I was always working with drawing <unk> , etc .
Films made a way to capture images and narratives , and that seemed like a lot of sense .
And of course , the stories that I chose to tell you , science fiction fiction was like , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; The <unk> . &quot;
And with &quot; The <unk> &quot; , I brought my love for underwater while diving with movies .
Talk to the two passions .
Something interesting came out of &quot; The <unk> &quot; that came to solve a specific <unk> problem in that movie , creating a sort of liquid <unk> , that we <unk> <unk> animation , <unk> , <unk> .
And this was the first soft surface of the &quot; soft surface &quot; , <unk> animation that ever had ever played in a movie .
And even though the movie never was <unk> , it was hardly any <unk> , I actually have to say something extraordinary , which was that the audience , the global public , was this <unk> magic .
You know , you know , it &apos;s Arthur Clarke &apos;s Law , which is that any enough advanced technology doesn &apos;t be to be able to distinguish of magic .
They saw something magical .
And I was very excited .
and I thought , &quot; Wow , this is something that should be <unk> in the <unk> . &quot;
So , with &quot; <unk> 2 &quot; , what my second film was , we have this much further .
<unk> with <unk> , we created the <unk> <unk> in that movie . The success depended on that that would work .
And that did it . And we created magic .
And we had the same result in the audience .
And we made a little bit of a little more money on that movie .
So , to draw a line between those two points of experience , this led to a whole new world of experience , this is a whole new world of creativity to <unk> .
So , I started a company called <unk> Winston , my good friend <unk> Winston , like the chief <unk> and <unk> was in time , and it was called Digital <unk> .
And the concept of the company was that we would make a leap after the analog processes of optical printers and such , and we would move on to digital manufacturing .
And that &apos;s what we actually did , and it gave us a competition for some competition .
But we found ourselves <unk> , in the mid- &apos; 90s , in the <unk> and <unk> corner , which we originally founded ,
So I wrote this piece called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which means to be absolutely the limits of visual effects of visual effects of <unk> effects , by the way , using realistic human emotional characters in <unk> and the world in <unk> and the world .
And I was told by the people in my company , that we &apos;re not able to be able to be able to do this .
So I put it into the refrigerator , and I made that other movie over a large vessel that was <unk> .
I sold it to the studio as , &quot; Romeo and Juliet &quot; on a ship .
It &apos;s a epic romantic , passionate movie .
What I wanted to do was to be able to go to the true <unk> of the Titanic .
That &apos;s why I made the movie .
And that &apos;s the truth . However , the studio didn &apos;t know .
But I convinced them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to go to the wreckage . We &apos;re going to go to see it .
We &apos;ll use it in the opening of the movie .
It &apos;s going to be very important . It &apos;s going to be a great marketing .
One I convinced them to fund an expedition .
It sounds like crazy . But this is the theme of your imagination that creates a reality .
Because , in fact , we created a reality where I found myself six months later in a Russian submersible , two and a half feet deep , in the north Atlantic to the ocean , looking at the true Titanic , not a movie star , not a film , not a movie , but really .
I was really amazed .
And it was required a lot of preparation , we had to develop cameras and <unk> and all sorts of things .
But it struck me as a lot of this dive , these deep dives that looked like <unk> .
And you know , you know , there was very technical , and it was the huge planning .
You go into a capsule , you go down into this dark hostile environment where there &apos;s no hope of hope if you can &apos;t come back .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , it sounds like I live in a science fiction fiction movie .
This is very cool .
And so , I had the flavor of the deep ocean looking into the deep ocean .
Of course , the curiosity , the <unk> of it .
It was all . It was a curiosity . It was curiosity . It was a sense of imagination .
Because , you know , I was able to put myself in a way that was able to create a visual impact for creating , but I couldn &apos;t imagine what I saw from that window .
As we looked at some of our next expeditions , I saw creatures in hydrothermal vents , and sometimes things I haven &apos;t seen before , things that have no thought that before the science had previously seen before the science at the time we saw them and <unk> .
And so this was completely <unk> and I had to do more .
And so I made a little more strange decision .
After the &apos; Titanic &apos; success , I said , &quot; Okay , I was <unk> my job as a filmmaker , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And so we started to plan these expeditions .
And we ended up with the <unk> , and it was <unk> with robotic vehicles .
We went back to the wreckage of the Titanic .
We took little <unk> <unk> that we had created this fiber optics .
And the idea was to go to , go to , go to a <unk> study of that vessel that was never done before .
No one had ever looked at the wreck . They didn &apos;t have the resources to do , so we developed technology to do it .
So here I am now , on the deck of the Titanic , <unk> in a submersible , and look at shelves that look like this , which I knew knew the connection .
And I <unk> a little <unk> through the vessel of the vessel .
When I tell you that I <unk> it , but my awareness of the vehicle is that I felt physically like the <unk> of the Titanic .
And it was the most <unk> kind of <unk> that I had ever had , because I was able to figure out what would be there , for the lights of the vehicle , because I had a few months later on the set of the vehicle when we were making the movie .
And the set was the set of <unk> on the blueprints of the ships .
So it was an absolutely remarkable experience .
And it made me realize that the <unk> experience , that you can actually have this kind of robotic <unk> , that your awareness <unk> into the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
It was really profound .
And maybe a little bit of a look at what could happen , what could happen , a few decades later , as a &quot; cyborg &quot; for exploration or other goals , in many different types of <unk> that I can imagine as a science fiction fiction .
So , these expeditions to the expeditions , and really begin to appreciate what was there , like the deep ocean wells , that we had these amazing gorgeous animals .
These are practically alien creatures on Earth .
They live in an environment of <unk> .
They don &apos;t live in any sunlight based on how to do that .
And so you can see animals that live next to 500 degrees Fahrenheit hot .
You might think they can &apos;t exist ,
At the same time , I was also very interested in getting very interested in <unk> , again , the Science fiction of fiction .
And I got involved in this <unk> game , very involved in NASA , <unk> on NASA , I went to Russia , and I went to see the <unk> biomedical biomedical <unk> , and all sorts of things , to actually go to the International Space Station with our 3D cameras .
And this was fascinating .
But what was the final result was that I was able to go to space with our <unk> .
And they take it so that they could have access to <unk> , planetary scientists , people who were interested in the extreme environments , they go to the sources and they take samples and take samples and take samples , and so on .
So here , here we were , documentary movies , but also really science doing it , and actually <unk> it .
I had the circle around the course of the science fiction fan of science fiction , you know , as a child , and all of this .
And you know , during this journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science , but I also learned a lot about leadership .
Now you might think that an artistic director should be a leader , unfortunately , the captain of the vessel , and those kinds of things .
I didn &apos;t really really have really really learned about leadership until I did that expeditions .
Because I had to say , &quot; What do I do here ?
Why is this ? What do I win ? &quot;
We don &apos;t deserve any money with these damn programs .
They are hardly any <unk> . There &apos;s no <unk> .
People think it &apos;s more or less that I have gone away between &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; .
And I made all these movies , all of these records for a very limited audience ,
No <unk> , no glory , no money . What are you doing ?
You &apos;re doing it for the work itself , for the challenge , and the ocean is the most challenging environment that it is , for the excitement of the discovery of discovery , and for the strange bond , when a small group of people form a <unk> team .
Because we did all these things that worked with <unk> people for years .
Sometimes it &apos;s time for the sea for <unk> months .
And by the band , you realize that the most important thing is that it &apos;s the most important thing that you have , you know , you &apos;ve got to have your job , you know , that you have a task to work that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
When you go back to <unk> and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the <unk> , and this , and all of this , and that , all of the technologies it and the difficulty , the human performance of the work on the sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain to people in the world . It &apos;s the thing that might have sex with this .
That creates a bond , creates a bond .
So when I came back to my next movie , what &quot; Avatar &quot; was , I was trying to take the same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you make your relationships .
And it really changed the dynamic .
So , there was a little team that I was with a little team , not able to map yet , &quot; Avatar &quot; , new technology , <unk> technology that &apos;s not before .
Quite exciting .
Quite challenging .
And we became a family , over four and a half years .
And it changed completely how I make movies .
So , people would comment on how to say , you know , the ocean was coming back and forth on the planet .
For me , it was more a fundamental way of doing things , the process itself was changing ,
So , what can we do from this ?
You know , what is the learned lessons ?
Well , I think number one is curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing you owns .
<unk> is a powerful force that can manifest reality .
And the respect of your team is more than all the credit for the world .
There are young filmmakers to come up to me and say , &quot; Please give me a little advice . &quot;
And I say , &quot; You don &apos;t need your limitations .
Other people will , if you want to do , don &apos;t do yourself , don &apos;t you .
And take risks . &quot;
NASA has this saying that it &apos;s crazy : &quot; <unk> is not an option . &quot;
But failure is to be an option in art and discovery , because it &apos;s a leap towards the deep .
And not a single important endeavor that innovation is done without any kind of risk .
You have to be willing to take those risks .
And that &apos;s the thought that I &apos;d like to leave you with you , that in whatever you &apos;re doing , it &apos;s an option , but fear not fear . Thank you .
Now , if I give you a big idea , it &apos;s the data that &apos;s the whole data that we use , bigger than the sum of the parts .
Instead of thinking about the <unk> of information , I want to think how we can use information to create patterns and trends that otherwise would otherwise remain invisible to patterns .
This is a typical <unk> <unk> .
The tool I use here is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called <unk> . With <unk> , I can filter one that &apos;s kind of like accidents .
I can see some other pattern coming out of this pattern .
That &apos;s because here in the middle there are the most active people , and that &apos;s the <unk> .
We can go back to <unk> and the data to get a cause of death .
We see that heart disease and <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
And when we go further and back at age 40 , for example , for example , for 40 years , we can see that accidents are the biggest cause of concern .
And when you go deeper into this , it &apos;s especially true for men .
You can see what I mean : this way to look at information like this in a living <unk> <unk> .
If we can do this with raw data , why is it not about content ?
What we have here , this is the cover of every number of <unk> <unk> that &apos;s ever been made .
Everything &apos;s here . It &apos;s all about it .
You can go to your room , and this is what I &apos;m talking about .
With <unk> you can zoom in for a decade .
You can zoom in a year .
You can go to a certain number .
So I &apos;m looking at this . So I see those athletes who came into this number , the sports play .
I &apos;m a fan of <unk> Armstrong , so I &apos;m going to click on it , and that gives me all the numbers that <unk> Armstrong .
If I just look at this very quickly , I &apos;m thinking , &quot; Why don &apos;t we have all the <unk> ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to go back to this point .
Now I see Greg <unk> .
And you see , if you look at this way of doing that through information , smaller and larger , in and out of that , you don &apos;t find yourself , you don &apos;t <unk> .
You &apos;re doing something different .
It &apos;s in between , and we think it changes how to use information .
So I want to take it a little bit more <unk> , a little bit more <unk> .
Here we &apos;ve taken every page of Wikipedia and it &apos;s limited to a small summary .
The summary is made up of a little <unk> and a <unk> to give up the <unk> .
I just want to show you the top 500 I &apos;m just showing you the Top 500 <unk> .
But even in this limited way , we can do a lot of it .
We can get a sense of the subjects that are the <unk> on Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to go on and choose .
Now , I &apos;ve chosen the government , and I see that the <unk> that it &apos;s in the most famous , Time magazine .
This is a very important thing because this is not the idea of the individual <unk> .
You can only get it through a step backwards and look at it all .
And when I look at one of those summaries , I can look deeper at the understanding of the Time Magazine magazine <unk> of the year by the year .
A look at all of these people to tell me the majority of politics .
Some come from the sciences .
A little bit of a few comes out of business .
That &apos;s my boss .
One comes from the <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is that Bono &apos;s also a TED <unk> .
So we can go to all the TED <unk> .
So we navigate it for the first time in the Web as if it &apos;s really a Web page , not from page to page , but on a <unk> .
Now , I &apos;d like to show you one other thing that you might be surprised .
Let me show you the website of the New York Times .
<unk> , this application -- I don &apos;t want to call it the browser , it &apos;s not a browser , but you can see web pages -- we map this <unk> technology -- we map this <unk> technology .
I &apos;m going to go back a step back and spring back , right ?
The reason why this is important is that I just look at web pages just like to look at pages in the same way .
I can look deeper into what I &apos;ve done in certain occasions .
Here &apos;s the status of the demo I just gave you .
I can play some things that I &apos;d like to look at today .
And if I take a step back and look at everything , I can look at my <unk> can perhaps be based on my <unk> .
Here I did some <unk> research , and I was looking for Bing Labs , and there &apos;s live Labs .
From there I can go into the page and go back to the page ,
And it &apos;s a metaphor that makes sense of every time , and every time , it makes every time it &apos;s the sum of the parts of the data .
Today , in our world , we see data as a curse .
We talk about the <unk> of <unk> information .
We talk about it in terms of data .
Now , if we could put that on his head , and the Web on its head , so that instead of going to be able to go from one thing to the next thing we can go to many things , we can go to many things , and see the patterns that otherwise would be hidden .
If we can do that , we can &apos;t be stuck in data , then maybe we can really get information .
Instead of working with information , we can maybe be knowledge .
If we have knowledge , maybe it &apos;s even wisdom .
Thank you so much .
Everybody speaks about happiness .
Now , I &apos;ve given someone the number of those books that I &apos;ve spent over the last five years with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title , and it was after about 40 , and there was a lot more .
There is a lot of interest in happiness , with researchers .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
Everyone wants to make people happy .
But despite that mass of work , there are different cognitive effects that can actually make it possible to think about happiness as well .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you today about the cognitive revolution .
And this is true for ordinary people who think about their own happiness , and this is what &apos;s interesting to think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re like everyone else .
The first catch is the <unk> to play complexity .
It turns out the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not useful word anymore because we apply it to too many things .
And I think that there &apos;s one certain sense of what we might be able to limit , but everything &apos;s considered this thing that we should aufgeben and we will be able to take the more complicated vision of what is well-being of which is well-being .
The second catch is the confusion between experience and memory : that &apos;s the difference between happy life in your life , and you &apos;re happy to be happy with your life .
And that are two totally different things that are going to be thrown on a lot of hope in the concept &quot; happiness . &quot;
And the third trap is the illusion of focus and the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think of a circumstance that impact on our well-being without having to influence the importance of it .
I mean , this is a cognitive <unk> .
There &apos;s no way to get this good .
Now , I &apos;d like to begin with an example of someone who was doing a <unk> and <unk> after one of my talks about one story .
And this was the story .
He said he was listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely fantastic music , and at the end of the recording was there was a terrible <unk> sound .
And when he said , it &apos;s really completely bizarre , that this was the whole experience .
But that was not true .
It was the memory of the experience .
He had had this experience .
He had had 20 minutes of music .
They were not worth much because he was sitting with a memory ; the memory was <unk> , and the memory was already supposed to be like that .
What this this is our <unk> is that we could see ourselves , and others could see as two people .
There &apos;s a <unk> I live that live in the present , and it knows that it &apos;s able to experience the past , but it &apos;s essentially the present .
The doctor moves up to our <unk> -- you know , if the doctor vraagt to say , &quot; Does it hurt pain if I &apos;m here ? &quot;
And then it &apos;s the <unk> I , and it &apos;s the <unk> that I <unk> it , and this is the story of our lives , and that &apos;s the person who is going to say , &quot; How do you have your time ? &quot;
&quot; How was your trip to Albania , &quot; or so .
Those are two very different things , the <unk> I and the <unk> I and the confusion between the understanding of the notion of happiness .
The <unk> I was a storyteller .
And it starts with a fundamental response of our memories -- it starts instantly .
We don &apos;t just tell stories when we tell us stories .
Our memory tells us stories , which is what we can preserve of our experience of our experience .
And let me leave you with one example .
This is an ancient inquiry .
Those are real patients that have a painful surgery .
I spare you the details . This is not painful anymore , but it was painful when this research was in the &apos; 90s .
They had to report every 60 seconds to report their pain .
And these are two patients .
These are their records .
And he &apos;s asked , &quot; Who has most of the pain ? &quot;
And that &apos;s a very easy question .
It &apos;s clear that patient &apos;s pain has had more pain .
His <unk> has taken longer , and for every minute of pain , the patient has had a chance A patient would have had a chance , and more .
But here &apos;s another question : How much pain thinking they had ?
And a surprise : The surprise is that patient A much worse reminder of the <unk> <unk> than patient B.
The stories of the <unk> <unk> because it &apos;s a very important part of the story -- and none of these stories are very inspiring -- but one of them is -- but one of those things is more than the other .
And the worse story is this story where the pain peaked at the end .
That &apos;s a <unk> story .
How do we know ? Because we asked these people after their <unk> , and much later , &quot; How bad was all the true ? &quot;
and it was much worse for A than B , in their memory .
Well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> and the <unk> .
From the point of view of the point of view , I was having B it .
Well , what you could do with patient A , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical trials , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s going to work , and it &apos;s going to be able to push the patient into the tube , without much moving into the tube .
That makes the patient pain pains , but not much , and much less than before .
And if you have a few minutes for that a few minutes ago , I did it for the patient &apos;s <unk> , and I did it for the patient &apos;s patient A much better story because the patient now has a better story about his experience .
What determines a story ?
And that &apos;s true for the stories that it provides memory , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
What a story determines its changes are changes important and important .
<unk> are very , very important , and this case was the most important thing .
Well , I live his life throughout life .
It &apos;s moments of experience , one after the other .
And you ask , what happens to these moments ?
And the answer is very simple .
They are lost forever .
I mean , most of our lives of our lives -- I did -- you know , the psychological present , you know , you know , the psychological present , you know ?
That means , you know , you know , in a life , you have about 600 million .
In a month there are about 600,000 .
The majority don &apos;t leave it .
Most of the world is not paying attention to the <unk> .
And yet , in some sense , you have the impression that they should be counting , that what &apos;s going to happen is that what &apos;s happening in this <unk> life is our lives .
It &apos;s the use of raw material we <unk> as we are on Earth .
And how to use that used to be relevant , but this is not the story that I <unk> for us .
So we have this <unk> and I <unk> it , and those are completely different .
The biggest difference between both of the time in terms of dealing with time .
From the point of view , I have a vacation time , and this is the second week , and this is the second week of the two weeks ago than the vacation was twice the vacation time .
That &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work for me .
In fact , for the last three weeks , I &apos;m hardly much better than the vacation of the vacation of the vacation , because there are no new memories .
You haven &apos;t changed the story .
And in that way , it &apos;s time actually the critical variable that I separates from a <unk> I separates from a <unk> .
Time has very few impact on this story .
The <unk> I &apos;m doing more than remembering and telling stories .
It &apos;s the person making decisions , because if you have a patient that , if you have a patient who , say , you have had two different surgeons in two different surgeons , and that &apos;s what he chooses to choose , then he chose to pick it up with the least bad memory , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s going to pick up .
The <unk> I have no voice in this choice .
We don &apos;t choose between experiences .
We choose between our memories . <unk> and even if we think about the future we think about the future we think we &apos;re not thinking of our future as our experience of our experience .
We think of our future as <unk> memories .
And you can actually look at this as follows , like a dictatorship of the <unk> I , and you can see the <unk> that I sort of take it into the sort of <unk> that I don &apos;t need to take it , I don &apos;t need the sense that it &apos;s the case for the first time that it &apos;s going to take the most frequently part of our <unk> I <unk> .
And that &apos;s kind of hard to justify .
I mean , how often do we use our memories ?
That &apos;s one of the statements that is given to the dominance of the dominance of the <unk> .
And if I &apos;m thinking about that about this , I think about a vacation we had a few years ago in Antarctica , which was clearly our best vacation , and I think it &apos;s quite a lot of time compared to other people &apos;s <unk> .
And I &apos;ve spent my memories in the last four weeks for about 25 minutes over the last four weeks .
Now , if I ever had ever opened the map to the 600 pictures , I would have spent an hour .
That &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s almost an hour .
There is a mismatch .
Now , maybe I &apos;m a little extreme , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in the limited time I have to use memories , but even if you do it , it &apos;s the big question : why do we have so much sense of memory -- why are we doing so that we are so much interested in experience ?
So I want you to think about a <unk> .
Imagine your next vacation you know that at the end of the vacation would be destroyed , and you &apos;ll have a pill to take your memory so that you know nothing else will remember .
Would you choose the same vacation ? And if you chose a different holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two <unk> .
and you have to think about how to resolve conflict .
That &apos;s not so obvious , because if you think of time , if you think of time , you have one particular answer .
And if you think of your memories , you might have a different answer .
Why is we choosing the <unk> that we choose , is a question that is a question that our <unk> with a choice between the two <unk> .
Now , the two <unk> go to two main approaches of happiness .
There are really two types of happiness that we can apply , one I can apply .
So you can ask , how happy is it ?
And then you would ask , how happy are the moments of life that I have ?
And all of these are -- the happiness of moments of time is a complicated process .
What are the emotions that can be measured ?
By the way , we can now be able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the happiness that I have through time .
And if you ask to go to the happiness of the <unk> I was there is a completely different thing .
This is not about how happy someone lives .
It &apos;s about how satisfied or satisfied the person is thinking about her life ,
Totally different concept .
And all those who throw these concepts on one pile will make a <unk> of the study of the happiness , and I <unk> to a group of students from the well-being that have been made a <unk> of the very long time of the study of the fortune of the fortune .
The distinction between the happiness of the happiness that I have and the satisfaction of the <unk> that I have recently realized , and there are now attempts to measure the Gallup Organization of the Gallup Organization for over half a million people who think about their lives and over their experience .
And there are any more efforts in that sense .
So in the last couple years , we begin to get insight into the happiness of the two main elements .
And the most important lesson we &apos;ve learned is that it &apos;s really different from each other .
You can know how happy someone is with his life , and you really learn how happy he is his life , and vice versa .
Just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about 0.5 .
That means that if you would meet someone and they would tell you that his father was a meter tall , how would you know about his height ?
You might know something about his length , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
That &apos;s how much of that uncertainty if I tell you that someone spends his life eight on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are about their <unk> .
So the correlation is weak .
We know something about what &apos;s the satisfaction of the <unk> I define .
We know that money is very important , goals are very important .
We know happiness in particular that means that we are happy with people we should be happy with people we can .
There are other <unk> , but this is a <unk> .
So , if you want to maximize the happiness of the two to try to maximize that it &apos;s going to be doing very different things .
The conclusion of what I &apos;ve said here is that we could really not think of happiness as a <unk> for well-being .
It &apos;s a completely different concept .
And then very quickly -- a different reason -- a different reason why we can &apos;t think of happiness as well as we think about the life , and if we live in the lives of that , and if we live that ?
So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you will not get the right answer .
If you ask that question , you think people have to be happier in California when you live in Ohio .
And what happens is that if you think of life in California , you think of the contrast between California and other places , and contrast that contrast for example , for example , in the climate .
It turns out that the climate is not such as important for me and even not even the way that I &apos;m sure how happy people are .
But it &apos;s because I can have the control of it , and it can turn out -- that some people go to California .
And it &apos;s interesting to go to what &apos;s going to happen with people moving to California in the hopes of the happier .
Well , their <unk> self will not be happier .
That &apos;s what we know .
But one thing that &apos;s going to happen is , they think they &apos;re happier , because if they think about it , they &apos;re going to be reminded of how terrible it was in Ohio .
And they &apos;re going to think they &apos;ve made the right decision .
It &apos;s very hard to think about <unk> about well-being , and I hope you have a sense of how <unk> it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you .
Thank you very much .
And when we put a few weeks ago on the line , you would tell me that there was a very interesting observation that came out of that <unk> .
Can you share this with our share for a few minutes ?
Daniel <unk> : Sure , I think the most interesting result is that we absolutely didn &apos;t expect .
It has to do with the happiness that I <unk> .
And when we look at how emotions are different versus income inequality ?
It turns out that under the <unk> of 60,000 dollars per year , for Americans , it &apos;s about a large population of Americans , like a large representative sample , a large representative sample of the income of 600,000 dollars a year --
CA : 60,000 <unk> : 60,000 60,000 dollars per year , they are unhappy , and they become <unk> as poor .
And up there , we see a completely flat line .
I mean , I mean , I &apos;ve rarely seen that flat lines .
It &apos;s clear that what happens is that the money doesn &apos;t give you a <unk> , but that &apos;s a lack of money to you , and we can measure the misery with big , really big precision .
To the other , I , for the other , I , you know , is a very different story .
The more money you deserve , the more you know you know .
That &apos;s not true for emotions .
CA : But Danny , the whole American pursuit of life is focused on life , freedom and pursuit of happiness .
And when people take the results seriously take seriously , it &apos;s going to take all the things that we believe in , say , <unk> policies and so on .
Is there a chance that politicians did , that the country would generally take a result seriously and make public policy based on it ?
DK : You know , I think there &apos;s a recognition of the role of <unk> in public policy .
That &apos;s when it &apos;s going to get going slowly into the United States , which is a no doubt but in the U.K . , but in the U.K . , this is happening , and in other countries .
People recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public policy .
It &apos;s going to take a time , and people will be going to debate about whether they want to study whether they want to study or study the <unk> of life , so we will be able to study that debate quickly .
As we increase happiness , it &apos;s completely different from how you think and whether you &apos;re thinking about the <unk> I .
This is going to affect the policy in the next few years , I think .
In the United States , it &apos;s been done to measure the <unk> of the population .
That &apos;s what I think about a year or a year of national statistics .
CA : Well , it seems to me that this thing is the subject to the most interesting thing about whether to follow the next few years .
Thank you very much for your invention of the behavioral economics .
Thank you , Danny <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
And that may seem a little bit surprising , because my full-time job , mainly , is about vaccines and seeds , about the things we need to invent and deliver the poorest two billion people .
But energy and climate are extremely important for those people , in fact , more than any of this planet .
The climate changing so well , their crops will not grow .
There will fall too too too too too late .
Things are going to change things so that their fragile environment simply can &apos;t handle it .
And that leads to hunger . It leads to uncertainty . It leads to <unk> .
So it will mean climate change for them .
The price of energy is extremely important for them .
In fact , if you could choose one thing to make a thing cheaper , to reduce poverty , would you choose your power .
The <unk> is <unk> .
Really , really , advanced civilization is based on progress in energy .
The <unk> led to the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century was there was a very quick <unk> for electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air conditioning , and so many things .
And so we have a wonderful situation of electricity in the rich world .
But , now , we make it cheaper -- and we make it twice as cheap -- it &apos;s a new limitation , and it &apos;s a new limitation .
CO2 leads to the warming of the planet , and the comparison of CO2 is actually a very simple one .
When you take up : the CO2 that is emitted , which leads to a temperature rise , and that leads to a number of very negative effects .
The effects of the weather and , perhaps worse , the indirect effects , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to these rapid ecosystems , and that &apos;s how you end up going to collapse .
Now , the exact amount of how you go from a certain amount of growth of CO2 to what &apos;s going to <unk> and where the positive <unk> are , that &apos;s all of uncertainty , but it &apos;s not very much .
And there is definitely uncertainty of how the consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be very serious .
I &apos;ve asked these many questions about <unk> .
should we really close from zero ?
Can &apos;t we take half or a quarter ?
And the answer is that until we reach near zero , the temperature will continue to be going to be going up .
And that &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s very different from , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , a four feet tall underneath a bridge that &apos;s going to take it down .
This is something that should go to zero .
Now , we once emitted a lot of CO2 , over oil , over 26 billion tons .
For every America , this is about 20 tons .
For people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
It &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
And we have to go to , whatever is going to change things to zero .
It &apos;s constantly going up .
Only economic changes have a little bit of economic change , so we have to go from a rapid rate , and from a <unk> to zero .
This equation has four factors .
A little bit of <unk> .
So , you have something on the left-hand side of the left , which you want to go to zero , and that &apos;s based on the number of people , the average use of services of services per person , the average use of energy to every service , and the CO2 emissions by <unk> .
So , let &apos;s see , let &apos;s look at this piece and see how we can go to zero .
Probably one of those values to get one of those values to zero .
That &apos;s a high school math , but let &apos;s take a look .
First of all , we have the population .
Now , the world today has <unk> billion people today .
That &apos;s the level of up to about nine billion .
So , if we really do well with new vaccines , health , health , health care , we could reduce that , maybe 10 or 15 percent , but we can see that there &apos;s about 1.3 .
The second factor is the services we use .
This includes everything , the food that we eat , clothing , TV , TV , heating .
These are very good things , and it &apos;s going to go away from poverty to almost everyone on the planet .
So it &apos;s amazing when this number goes up .
In the richer world , maybe it &apos;s the top one billion , we can probably take <unk> and <unk> , but every year , this number goes up , on average , up , and so on , it &apos;s going to be the <unk> services per person .
Here we have a very simple service .
If you have any enlightenment in your house to read your homework , they don &apos;t , so they go outside , so they go out and read their homework under the <unk> .
So , efficiency , E , the energy for every service .
We have good news .
We have something that isn &apos;t going up .
Through different inventions , different ways of enlightenment , through different kinds of enlightenment , different ways of building cars , different ways of building .
There are many services that you need to reduce the energy that is pretty much lower .
Some individual services , even by 90 percent .
There are other services , like how we produce manure or how to interact , where the space for improvement is much smaller ,
And so , if we are optimistic , there can be a factor of three to maybe , maybe , maybe , a factor of six .
But for these first three factors , we have gone from 26 billion to the best , 13 billion , and that &apos;s just not enough .
So let &apos;s take this fourth factor -- this is going to be an important factor -- this is the CO2 emissions per capita .
So the question is , can you go to zero ?
If you go to <unk> , no .
If you put natural gas , no .
Basically , almost every way to produce electricity at the day , except , the emerging renewable energy and nuclear power produces CO2 .
And what we need to do is to be able to do a new system of creating a new system .
So we need <unk> .
So , if I &apos;m thinking of this term , I &apos;m not supposed to be able to do that that &apos;s impossible .
The <unk> is a miracle . The PC is a miracle .
The Internet and his services are a miracle .
So , the people have contributed to creating many miracles .
Typically , we have no deadline , when you have to have the miracle on a particular date .
Usually you just wait , and sometimes it happens , sometimes , sometimes .
This is a case where we should go to <unk> at full speed and a miracle in a tight agenda .
Now I was thinking , how can I actually display this ?
Is there a kind of natural illustration , a demonstration to people speaking to the imagination ?
I was thinking about a year ago when I was able to bring mosquitos to it , and it was a way of thinking about that .
It made them really involved in the idea that there are people who live with mosquitos .
So , with energy , this was the only thing I could think of .
So I decided to make sure that I would free the environment to the environment this year .
So here we have some natural fireflies .
And I was told that they &apos;re not going to bite , stronger , they might not even be able to even take this jar .
So , there are all sorts of <unk> solutions like that , but they don &apos;t really deliver anything .
We need solutions , one or many , many , many , on an incredible scale , and of a tremendous amount of trustworthiness , and although people in many ways look , there &apos;s only five who can contribute a vital amount .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m doing , <unk> , geothermal , nuclear fusion ,
They might be able to contribute , and if they do better than I expect , it &apos;s better , but my important point here is that we &apos;re going to work on each of those five and we can &apos;t sit there because it looks like that , because they all have their own important difficulty .
Let &apos;s first look at fossil fuels , either burning of coal and burning natural gas .
What should you have to do that , may seem simple , but it &apos;s not .
You have to take all the CO2 off the burning of the burning of pressure , <unk> and liquid , and hope it stays there .
Now there are a number of <unk> that doing this at the level of 60 to 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to go to 100 percent , and determine where we already have to store CO2 , it &apos;s very hard , but the most difficult part of this is the <unk> .
Who will this know ?
Who &apos;s going to be able to stand up for something that literally billions of times larger than any kind of waste could be thought of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
This is a huge volume .
So that &apos;s hard .
The next is nuclear energy energy .
There &apos;s also three major problems .
The cost , especially in <unk> countries , are high .
The question of security , absolutely certainty , could not be able to go , even though you have these human operators , that can be used to nuclear weapons .
And what do you do with the garbage ?
And , although it &apos;s not so much , it &apos;s a lot of concern about it .
One is a good feeling about it .
So there are three very difficult problems that may be solvable , and what needs to be worked .
The last three five of the five , I have <unk> .
These are what people often call the renewable resources .
And that -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t require a fuel -- there &apos;s some downsides .
One is that the density of energy is the density of the energy of these technologies is significantly lower than one of those technologies .
This is <unk> , then you have this over many square kilometers , thousands of times more space than you need for a standard power station .
These are the <unk> sources .
The sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , and not every day , and no every day , it &apos;s not always going to .
And so , if you depend on these sources , you have to find a way to have a way to have energy during those periods that they &apos;re not available .
So , we have big <unk> here .
We have challenges .
Let &apos;s say , for example , this energy source is outside of your country , you don &apos;t need the technology , but you have to do with the risks from elsewhere .
And finally , the <unk> problem .
And to make that visible , I looked at all the kinds of batteries which are made , for cars , for computers , for telephones , for everything , and compared to the amount of electrical energy that used to use the world , and what I thought was that all the batteries that use less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
So we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor of factor that is going to have a factor of 100 better than we have now .
It &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
This is important if you &apos;re trying to get the <unk> source to get higher than 20 to 30 percent of what you use .
If you go to 100 percent , you need a <unk> .
Now , how are we going to find progress , what &apos;s the right approach ?
Is it a <unk> ? How can we achieve this ?
Well , we need a lot of companies that work there , hundreds of them .
In each of those five paths , at least 100 people .
And a lot of them , you know , you &apos;ll find some crazy . That &apos;s good .
And , I think here in the <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of people who have already been striving for this .
Bill <unk> has different companies , including one called <unk> that has a large thermal <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are investing in dozens of companies and some interesting possibilities , and I try to support it .
Nathan Myhrvold and I support a company that might be surprising , nuclear .
There are some innovations in nuclear , modules and liquid .
And there &apos;s no innovation already in this industry , so it &apos;s not so strange that there are good new ideas .
The idea of <unk> is that , instead of just a small part of Uran , one percent , namely , one percent , namely , we decided to use the 99 percent , <unk> .
a little strange idea .
You know , it &apos;s all over here , but they &apos;ve never been able to simulate it , or they would work .
But by the beginning of supercomputers , that &apos;s what &apos;s happening , and yes !
The right materials will probably work .
And because you use the 99 percent , the cost to reduce cost .
You even used to use the waste , and if your fuel &apos;s fuel , you can use the waste of the current nuclear reactors ,
So instead of caring , this is a new fuel , which is great !
It uses this <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s like a candle .
And you see in this animation , it &apos;s often called a <unk> reactor .
So for the fuel , it &apos;s really the solution .
I have a picture of a place in Kentucky .
This is <unk> , the 99 percent , where the one percent is taken .
So it &apos;s called <unk> Uran .
That &apos;s enough for the United States for hundreds of years .
And you can filter it into a cheap way of seawater , you have enough fuel for the entire planet &apos;s life .
So , there are many challenges for the future , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to go forward .
So let &apos;s think , how do we measure ourselves ?
What should our report report ?
Let &apos;s first look at what we need to come out , and then go to the <unk> .
By 2050 , a lot of people talk about 80 percent reduction .
And it &apos;s really important to get that .
And 20 percent is used by poor countries , a part of agriculture .
Hopefully , we have clean forestry and cement .
So , in order for that 80 percent to get the developed countries , including countries like China , their <unk> have completely clean that clean .
And the other requirement required : &quot; Do we have any advanced technologies in all the developed countries , and are we doing that in other places ? &quot;
That &apos;s a big deal .
That &apos;s a big question for that report report .
So how should we see the report for 2020 ?
Well , it needs to satisfy the two requirements .
We need to reduce the efficiency of the efficiency emissions .
The less we <unk> , how less CO2 the CO2 is , and so , how to lower the temperature .
But in some ways , the degree that we &apos;re going to do , by doing things that don &apos;t go to the large <unk> , just maybe , or perhaps , or maybe even slightly less important than the other , than the other , that &apos;s the innovation .
These breakthroughs have to push it at full speed , and we can measure it in terms of companies , <unk> , <unk> things that have changed .
Here &apos;s a big number of beautiful books about it .
The book of Al Gore , &quot; Our Choice &quot; and the book of David <unk> Buch , &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the hot air . &quot;
They light it really well , and they put a framework that can be discussed in large lines , because we need to have a broad <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of stuff to come together .
So this is a wish .
It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
If you just give me one wish for over the next 50 years , I could pick up who I was able to pick a vaccine , I could choose a vaccine , something that I love , or I could choose that &apos;s going to be invented with half of the cost without CO2 , this is the wish I would choose .
This is the most powerful impact .
If we don &apos;t have this wish , the separation between the people that think of the short-term and long-term ones are going to be terrible , between the United States and China , between poor and rich countries , and especially the lives of those two billion .
So , what should we do ?
What is the question I &apos;m going to do ?
We need to go for more funding of research .
As countries come together in places like Copenhagen , they don &apos;t just have to talk about the CO2 .
They have to discuss these <unk> , and you &apos;ll note that they &apos;re going to be amazed by the stupid approaches to these innovative approaches .
We need <unk> , <unk> , ceiling and trade , something that is going to make the cost visible .
We have to carry out the message .
This dialogue has to become <unk> and <unk> , including the steps that take the government .
This is an important wish , but I think we can achieve it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Now , you know , I understand more about <unk> , OK ? I mean , first of all , I mean , the first place to give you a sense of scale of the investment ?
Bill Gates : In fact , Bill Gates : You can buy the supercomputer , all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , is that it &apos;s only tens of millions , and even if we ever test our materials in a Russian nuclear reactor that are going to be able to make sure that our materials are right , it &apos;s going to be able to go into the hundreds of millions .
The <unk> is going to be the construction of the experimental reactor , finding the number of billion , finding the <unk> , the site to such a way to actually build it .
Once you first built the first one , if this works like <unk> , it &apos;s just completely obvious , because the economy , the <unk> , are different than we know it .
CA : And you know , well , to understand it well , it &apos;s going to be moving deep down below the ground like this , almost like this sort of vertical column of nuclear fuels , and then the process starts going back to the top and going down ?
BG : That &apos;s true . Today , the reactor will be <unk> , so you have a lot of people , so you have a lot of people and a lot of the controls that are going to be able to open up , that you have to open up and stuff .
That &apos;s not good .
So , if you have a very cheap fuel that can take you 60 years -- just think of it as a <unk> -- put it down , and it doesn &apos;t last of the complexity .
And it &apos;s just going to burn 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
CA : It &apos;s a <unk> that solves its own <unk> .
BG : Yes . Now , what happens to the waste , you can leave it -- there &apos;s a lot of less waste with this approach -- whether you can take it away , and put it in a different way , and it &apos;s going to be able to put it in a different way .
And we begin to create the waste that exists today , which is that it &apos;s stored in the reactor or is stored in vessels .
That &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
So , what a problem was a problem of these reactors , actually , in fact , what &apos;s going to happen in our , and you reduce the volume of the waste quite dramatic by this process .
CA : But in your global conversation about these possibilities , what is the most important thing to do with this ?
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t selected a particular place , and there are some interesting <unk> everywhere all nuclear hot , so we &apos;re enjoying a lot of interest in the company in Russia , India , India .
I &apos;ve met this <unk> of energy about this , to talk about how this fits into the <unk> .
So I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and the Japanese have done some work .
This is a variant of something that &apos;s already done .
It &apos;s a major leap forward , but it &apos;s like a rapid reactor , and many countries have built it , so anyone who has a rapid reactor has a potential to build the first one .
CA : So , in your mind , your mind and probability of doing something like this ?
BG : Well , we need to have these kinds of <unk> at large scale that are very cheap , we have 20 years old , and then 20 years to implement it .
That &apos;s sort of a kind of well-being we have learned to have learned what we need to meet .
And , you know , you know , <unk> , if everything goes well , what a lot of people might wish , could be easy .
And there are now happy tens of thousands of companies , we need hundreds of them , which is , well , if their investigation is going to be good , if the funding is going to be good , they can compete with this .
And it &apos;s the best if there &apos;s a lot of progress , because then you can use a mixture of those things .
We have least need one to succeed .
CA : In terms of changing changes at large scale , this is the largest one you know ?
BG : A energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
That would have been , even without the <unk> , but the <unk> , it makes it so much bigger .
In the nuclear system , there are other innovators too .
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this one , but the <unk> people , this is a different approach .
There &apos;s a type of <unk> that looks like a little bit of hard , but maybe they &apos;re like us .
So there are different , but the beauty of this thing is a <unk> has a million times as much energy as a <unk> , and , like , if you can interact with the negative effects , it &apos;s essentially the radiation that &apos;s essentially the radiation , the footprint , and the cost , of course , in terms of influence on the land and different things , in terms of the country .
CA : If this doesn &apos;t work , what ?
should we begin with the <unk> to try to keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
BG : If you come to that situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve got obesity and it &apos;s about to get a heart attack .
What are you going to go to ? You can go to a <unk> or something like that .
There &apos;s a line of research that &apos;s called <unk> , which is different techniques that would slow the heat that we &apos;re going to buy for 20 or 30 years .
That &apos;s just a kind of insurance .
You hope you don &apos;t need it .
Some people say that you don &apos;t even need to work like that , because maybe you make you guys happy , you know , you know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> to save you .
I don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s good , but it &apos;s the importance of the problem , but it &apos;s the argument that it &apos;s going to happen to be able to happen , if the innovation is going to be slower , whether it &apos;s going to go faster than we expect .
CA : <unk> skeptics : if you could say one or two sentences to tell them , how would you convince them that they &apos;re wrong ?
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics are coming out of different camps .
There are very few things that have scientific arguments .
Do they say that there are negative feedback effects that have to deal with the clouds that compensate ?
There are very , very few things they can say , there &apos;s a chance of one one that they can say is a chance of one one in one year that &apos;s happening .
The most important problem that we have here is just like AIDS .
You make a mistake , and you spend a lot of time later .
And yes , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of losing the pain to later , and a somewhat <unk> pain .
In fact , it describes the <unk> not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world that take the IPCC and say , well , all right ?
It should be that should be that uncertainty to us this thing .
But my dream is that , if you can make economically , it &apos;s going to stick to the <unk> , then the skeptics say , well , well , it doesn &apos;t give me a CO2 -- I might even wish to wish that it &apos;s going to have CO2 , but I &apos;ll just take it because it &apos;s cheaper than first .
CA : And that would be your response to the argument of <unk> <unk> , that actually if you spend all of this energy on the side of the <unk> , it goes to the cost of all of your other goals to try to save the world of poverty and malaria , etc .
It &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to spend money there when there are better things we can do with it .
BG : Well , what &apos;s the true cost of R &amp; amp ; D , say that the United States has to spend 10 billion more dollars more than now -- is not so dramatic .
It doesn &apos;t have to be taken by other things .
It &apos;s really a big deal , and this is a fair amount of people that can be different from the point of view when you want to fund something that is <unk> ,
That &apos;s , I think , it &apos;s usually a waste .
Unless you &apos;re very close to a solution , and it &apos;s just the learning curve , and it &apos;s very cheap .
I think we need more things that have the potential to have the potential to be much less expensive .
And if the premise that you &apos;re beginning to start is , we can make the energy super expensive , then the rich can afford it .
I mean , I mean , every time we can afford five times , we could actually not have to be able to change our lifestyle without changing our lifestyle .
The catastrophe for those two billion .
And even <unk> has changed .
His <unk> is now , why is not spoken about R. D.
He &apos;s still being , because of his previous statements , it &apos;s associated with the <unk> camp , but it realized that it &apos;s a pretty lonely camp .
And so there &apos;s a red wire that I think is going to be important .
And it &apos;s crazy how few R &amp; amp ; D is funded .
CA : Well , Bill , I suspect that I &apos;m speaking of most of the people here when I say , that I &apos;m really hoping your wish will happen . Thank you .
BG : Thank you .
You &apos;d like to share with you a few months ago when I was writing an article for the Wired magazine .
I love the <unk> with the hand when I was writing it , but I was already ready with the process , and I came up with the word &quot; <unk> &quot; .
I read you the text .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : healthy , strong , <unk> . &quot;
I was reading this for a friend and first time , because it was so ridiculous , but it was just after &quot; <unk> &quot; , and I had to stop to stand back to myself , because of the emotional shock and the blow that these words came to the emotional shock .
All right , this is a good <unk> <unk> .
I think this is an old pressures , right ?
But it was a big deal in early &apos; 80s , when I was starting to begin with the elementary school school and started to develop a picture of myself outside of my family and related to the other children and the world around me .
And I don &apos;t need to say that I didn &apos;t have to say that I didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
With this description , it looks like I was born in a world that I was born in a world where someone who was not supposed to say to say , as a positive thing to say , as I was in my life ,
So , I was going to go to 2009 go to 2009 , and I was expecting a good <unk> .
This is the <unk> version of the text .
Unfortunately , not much better .
In particular , I find the last words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; are disturbing , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
It &apos;s not just about words .
It &apos;s about our opinions about people when we name these words .
The values behind the words , and how to build those values ?
Our language influences us and how to look at the world and how to look at other people .
A lot of old societies including the Greeks and the <unk> believed that it was a <unk> that was a curse like a curse that says something out loud .
So what kind of reality do we want to do , a person that &apos;s limited , or a person that is powerful ?
If we do <unk> things like the <unk> of a person , a child , a child , a child , and we put it into a shadow of their strength .
Do we prefer to open doors for them ?
Somebody who opened doors to my doctor was my doctor , when I was a kid , at the <unk> Institute in <unk> , <unk> .
He &apos;s called Dr. <unk> .
<unk> , whose name apparently was too hard to talk , so he was Dr. P.
Dr. P. <unk> was always very <unk> <unk> and had exactly the good institution to work with children .
I enjoyed almost all the time that I was in that <unk> , except for the <unk> .
I had to do a quick <unk> bunch of repetitive exercises with that thick <unk> -- different colors -- different colors -- to build my <unk> .
I hated that <unk> more than anything .
I hated them , gave them names . I hated them ,
As a <unk> child , I negotiated with Dr. P. <unk> , without the result , of course , of course .
One day he came into a session -- <unk> and <unk> was those sessions -- and he said to me , &quot; Wow . Aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful girl , I &apos;m going to give you a <unk> . &quot;
If you give me a <unk> , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
Of course this was a tactical shift from Dr. P to me , to make the exercises that I didn &apos;t want to do with the richest five year-old girl in the ward , but what it was doing for me was that he was doing a nasty , a new , <unk> experience .
But today , I &apos;m wondering , well , what is his vision , and his observation , that I was a powerful and powerful girl , my self has shaped like a <unk> powerful , powerful and <unk> person into the future .
This is an example of how adults can be able to be able to <unk> the power of a child .
But in the past situations of the <unk> of that <unk> , our language is our evolution to reality that we &apos;d all like to see , the ability to see itself as a <unk> .
Our language follows the changes in society , not , and a lot of those are developed by technology .
In terms of a medical perspective , my legs , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for old bodies , make sure that people can do more with their capacity to be able to be able to identify themselves by the nature of nature to be able to identify themselves .
So maybe technology shows us that there &apos;s a lot of light to see a truth : that all of us have a <unk> and having some <unk> , and that our ability to adapt to our best trait is .
The ability of people to adapt to it , is interesting , because everybody wants to talk to me about the defeat of adversity , and I &apos;m going to give you a confession .
That makes me never happy , and it felt uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and I begin to understand why .
The <unk> &quot; overcome adversity &quot; involves that success or happiness means that you wake up after a <unk> experience , <unk> without having a <unk> experience of life , as well as my success in the life of the <unk> <unk> of a life of a living stream of life expectancy , which other than my disability .
But in reality , we have changed . Of course we are drawn by a challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotional or both .
And my thesis is that it &apos;s a good thing .
<unk> is not a obstacle that we need around , but it can live through .
It &apos;s a part of our life .
I tend to see it as my shadow .
Sometimes I see a lot of very little , sometimes , but it &apos;s always in me .
I certainly won &apos;t be the impact and the importance of someone &apos;s struggles .
There &apos;s difficulty and challenge living in life , and it &apos;s all very different , but the question is not whether you have to deal with adversity , but how to deal with it .
So our responsibility is not simply to protect ourselves from adversity , but it &apos;s paying good attention to it .
We don &apos;t prove to our children if we can make them feel like they can &apos;t be able to adapt .
There is a major difference between the objective of the objective that I &apos;m a <unk> and the subjective public opinion , or whether I &apos;m not <unk> .
Frankly , the only real conditions that I &apos;ve ever encountered , is the world that was always believed to describe me with those definitions .
And in our desire to protect our loved ones by giving them the <unk> facts of their medical forecast , or even a prediction of the <unk> quality of life , we have to be sure that we don &apos;t actually put the first stone on that we actually make someone <unk> .
Maybe it &apos;s the way to look at what &apos;s going on with you and how to fix it , someone more than the pathology himself .
By the end of the &quot; <unk> &quot; of a person , by the side of a person , they don &apos;t recognize a new disease , we create a new disease on top of the natural struggle they might have .
In fact , we judge someone &apos;s added value for our society .
So we need to look at the pathology diseases that look at the range of human capabilities ,
The most important thing is that there &apos;s a collaboration between the visible flaws and our best creative abilities .
It &apos;s not about the difficult time , or to deny that , if we want to avoid whether or not under the <unk> of the <unk> , but instead of trying to figure out , in the <unk> of the <unk> .
Maybe it &apos;s the idea that I want to leave you with , you don &apos;t have to overcome adversity , but it &apos;s supposed to open it up , it &apos;s going to embrace it , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s going to use a <unk> , maybe even using a <unk> , even using it .
And when we understand adversity , it &apos;s consistent and useful , we may feel well less by <unk> .
This year , this year , celebrate the <unk> anniversary of Charles Darwin , and when he was 150 years ago , Darwin wrote a story about the human nature .
Free translated , it &apos;s not the most powerful species that survives , but the most intelligent species , but the species that are the best changes that are going to change .
<unk> is the emergence of creation .
In fact , among the other things that we can tell from Darwin &apos;s work is that the human ability of survival and <unk> is driven by the mental struggle of conflicts .
Again , transformation , transformation , is our greatest ability .
until we get on the trial , we don &apos;t know what we can do .
Perhaps that &apos;s the thing that <unk> us : self-awareness , our sense of our own power .
So we can give ourselves a <unk> .
We can think of adversity as well as well as we can only have difficult time .
Maybe we can see it as a change .
<unk> is a change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted .
I think it &apos;s the most important adversity that we have given to our understanding of the notion of <unk> .
Who is normal ?
There &apos;s no normal .
There &apos;s <unk> . There &apos;s no ordinary . There &apos;s no normal .
And who would be willing to meet that poor , <unk> person ?
I didn &apos;t think it was .
And if we can transform the paradigm of encouraging the paradigm to turn to one of the possibilities of possibilities , or potentially , can be more of the power of much more children than we can <unk> , and they invite their rare and valuable abilities to share their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
<unk> tell us that the only thing that we need humans to have always is useful , it &apos;s useful to contribute .
Well , there are evidence that the Neanderthals were 60,000 years ago , they were able to lose their elderly and severe pain , maybe because the <unk> and the survival of these people , they didn &apos;t think of the people as a broken and valuable .
A few years ago , I was on the marketplace in the village where I grew up in that red piece of <unk> Pennsylvania , and I was curved with a <unk> tomatoes .
It was summer . I had a short pair of pants .
I heard a man behind me saying , &quot; If that &apos;s not Aimee <unk> . &quot;
I turned to , it was an older man . There was no idea who he was .
I said , &quot; Excuse me ? We can &apos;t remember that ? &quot;
He said , &quot; You know , it &apos;s possible that you don &apos;t know we know each other ?
When we first met each other , I was out of your mother &apos;s uterus . &quot;
Oh , this guy .
And of course , a lot of the time .
This guy was a doctor <unk> , a man I knew only about my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because I was coming up with the typical age of two weeks for my own birthday .
My mother &apos;s <unk> was already on vacation , so the man who was watching me was a stranger in my parents .
And because I was born without <unk> and <unk> feet , and a pair of toes on one and the other foot , this stranger would communicate the bad news .
He said to me , &quot; You know , I had to give your parents the forecast that you could never go to , and never could have the <unk> that could have other children and could never have independent life , and that &apos;s how you made a liar . &quot;
The extraordinary thing is he told that he has accumulated over my childhood , whether it was a <unk> I won in the second grade , <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , and he used it , <unk> it , <unk> it , <unk> it , <unk> it .
Of course he called this <unk> , the potential of the human .
no forecast can predict how powerful this can be its way to the quality of life .
Doctor <unk> went further , he said , &quot; Well , I experience that , if it &apos;s not going to <unk> , and even with a limited amount of support , a child will reach out . &quot;
You see , your doctor had changed his mind .
He understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone could do with it .
And in the course of time , my thinking has changed , because , if you asked me , if you asked me , if you had a 15-year-old or a time , I would have no time <unk> .
I used to <unk> that <unk> .
Now , if you ask me , I don &apos;t know what it is like .
That &apos;s because of the experience that I had with it , not despite the experience that it had with it .
Maybe this has changed in me because I &apos;m more exposed to people who have opened doors to me than on those who wanted to limit me and <unk> .
Look , you just need one human that you can see the revelation of your own strength , and you go to there .
If you can give someone the key to his own power , the human mind is so that it &apos;s <unk> , if you can do that and can open up a way for someone to open up , you can open it up in the best way .
You teach them to open doors .
The exact meaning of the word &quot; education &quot; comes from &quot; <unk> &quot; .
That means that what &apos;s inside of the inside of it , is that it &apos;s going to be able to go back to space .
So again , what is the potential to go to it ?
There was a <unk> in the &apos; 60s in England , where they went from <unk> to <unk> to <unk> .
It was called <unk> . In the United States , we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
They split students 10 , nine , eight , seven , so .
The <unk> are getting a <unk> , the best teachers , etc .
During a time of three months , they gave <unk> students 10 , and they would tell them that they were A , they were intelligent .
At the end of the three months , they <unk> on <unk> .
The <unk> &apos;s side of this study is they told the <unk> that they were <unk> .
And that &apos;s also after three months .
Those who were still at school , besides the people who had <unk> .
A key part of this study was that the teachers were also considered to be loved .
The teachers didn &apos;t know that there was something like this .
And he was telling them , these are the students that are coming .
And so they went to teach them , and so they treated them .
I think it &apos;s the only real physical mind that &apos;s a <unk> mind , a <unk> mind doesn &apos;t know much .
He doesn &apos;t see beauty .
He &apos;s our natural , <unk> curiosity , no more curiosity , no our ability to imagination our imagination .
And if we can , if we can strengthen the mind , it can hope to see beauty in itself , to see beauty in itself and others , to be curious and <unk> , then we actually use our power .
If a mind has these qualities , it &apos;s able to create new ways of creation , new ways to be new ways .
Let me conclude with a poem by a <unk> Persian poet , <unk> that my friend Jacques <unk> told me .
The poem is called &quot; The god reading only four words . &quot;
&quot; Every child knows God , not the God of <unk> , not the God of <unk> , but God who knows only four words he &apos;s going to repeat , <unk> with me . &quot;
Thank you .
