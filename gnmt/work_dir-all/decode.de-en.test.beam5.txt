A few years ago , here at TED , Peter <unk> called a <unk> called The <unk> .
The idea is pretty simple . <unk> have to take the <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti cans , like a <unk> tape , like a <unk> tape and a marshmallow .
The marshmallow must be her .
And , even though it &apos;s really just , it &apos;s really hard , because it &apos;s really hard to work together .
And so I thought this was an interesting idea , and I made it into a <unk> .
It was a huge success .
Since then , I &apos;ve done about 70 workshops worldwide , with students , <unk> and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> and there &apos;s some of the things that profound perceptions in the nature of collaboration , and I want to share some of them with you .
Normally , most people start to orient towards the task .
They talk about how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to take power .
You put a little bit of time into planning and organization , and you go to <unk> and <unk> .
They spend a majority of their time in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And finally , just before they don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and they put it gently down at the top , step back and forth !
But what &apos;s going on , almost always happens , is that it &apos;s going to be a &quot; <unk> &quot; because the weight of the <unk> , because the weight of the Higgs field is going to be <unk> and <unk> .
There &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more <unk> than there &apos;s a lot more <unk> than others , and under the <unk> are fresh <unk> .
They &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re really <unk> stuff .
And of course , there &apos;s also teams which have a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; and the best of fresh water are fresh .
And this is pretty amazing .
Like Peter , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
What they might be wondering , how is this ? Why ? What is it ?
And Peter , I said , &quot; None of the kids are investing in the course of the spaghetti sauce . &quot;
They don &apos;t invest time in <unk> .
But there &apos;s another reason .
And that &apos;s that <unk> was trained to find a proper plan , right ?
And it &apos;s to realize it .
What happens when they put the marshmallow up at the top , they have no time more and what happens ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
Sounds familiar , what ?
What &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s going to start with the marshmallow and prototype prototypes , with the marshmallow that the marshmallow at the top , so they could have the way that they could <unk> <unk> prototypes .
<unk> recognize this sort of thing like a <unk> <unk> .
And with every trial , the children could get instant feedback , and what &apos;s not ?
So it &apos;s the performance to work with prototypes , much -- but look at how different teams act .
The average average for most of the time , for example , is to make a difference , is that half of it is going to have a bit more , but not much , but not much , more than the adults .
Who &apos;s at the most successful ?
Architects and engineers , fortunately .
<unk> is what I saw .
And why ? Because they can understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns , are key to sustainable structures .
CEOs lie about average . But this is interesting .
<unk> to the team on the team , they become significant better .
It &apos;s incredible . You can see , &quot; This team is going to win . &quot;
You can predict that . Why is this ?
Because they have certain skills of color .
They conduct the process , they understand it .
And this team , this team that manages to do and work on the work , is significantly improving the performance of the team .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination of success .
If you have 10 teams that are going to be typical , you get about six and you get it right .
Now , I was trying to take some interesting .
I was thinking , well , we have the <unk> .
So I offered a $ <unk> prize for the winners .
What do you think about this <unk> ?
What was the result ?
This is what happened . Not a team had a firm structure .
If someone had a big construction building built , he would have been carrying the price home .
So isn &apos;t it interesting that there &apos;s a strong effect of having a strong effect ?
We repeated this exercise with the same student .
What do you think ?
Now you understand the benefit of the <unk> .
That &apos;s the same thing from the same , bad team one among the best .
They produced the highest construction in time .
So there are some <unk> lessons for us about the nature of power and success .
You might like to ask , why would someone actually spend time doing a <unk> ?
The reason is , I &apos;m going to create digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games , video games , video games .
And what the <unk> does is it &apos;s helping to identify hidden assumptions .
Because open , every project has his own marshmallow .
The challenge is a common experience , a common language , or <unk> to build the right prototype .
And this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
And those of you who care about it , can go to <unk> .
It &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the <unk> .
There is a <unk> there .
You find crazy examples of all over the world , how people tweak the system and <unk> .
There &apos;s also <unk> .
And the fundamental lesson , I think , is that it &apos;s actually a <unk> sport .
It demands that all our senses up to the task , and we use our way to use our thinking , how our sensations and our actions , in the challenge that we have .
And sometimes it &apos;s a little prototype of this experience all that it needs to take us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
And this can make a difference .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s pretend that we have a machine .
A big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a time a time machine .
And everybody in this room must .
And you can go to the past , you can go to the future , you can go to the future , you can &apos;t go to this and now .
And I wonder what you would choose , because I have my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
I don &apos;t know . You know , they wanted to go back to the time , before there was cars or Twitter or America .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s sort of a <unk> to <unk> , <unk> .
That &apos;s what I understand .
I &apos;m not part of this group , I must say .
I don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because I &apos;m a <unk> .
It &apos;s because there &apos;s no way to go back to this planet , they go forward .
So I want to go into this machine , and I want to go to the future .
This is the greatest time you gave you that on the planet , no matter how much you put it , health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , <unk> <unk> .
There was never a time like this .
My <unk> died all than they were 60 .
My grandparents raised this number on <unk> .
My parents are 80 on the <unk> .
So there should be better at the beginning of my <unk> .
But it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than this .
A child born in New Delhi today can be expected to live like the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
Think about that . That &apos;s an incredible fact .
And why is this ?
The smallpox . The smallpox epidemic made billions of people on this planet .
They have the demographics of the Earth in a way that you could have done .
They &apos;re gone . They have disappeared .
We have it <unk> . <unk> .
In the rich world , there are diseases which millions of us threatened only with one generation of us , not yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
Does anyone know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the successes of scientific method .
And from my point of view , the scientific way of trying to get things to try to look at , whether it &apos;s going to work that it doesn &apos;t work like this , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
So that &apos;s the good news .
Unfortunately , it &apos;s all good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve mentioned a lot of other problems .
And one of them is that , despite all our achievements , a billion people going to go to bed every day .
That number goes up , and it goes very quickly , and this is a shame .
And not just that , we used to use our imagination to <unk> this world well .
drinking water , water &apos;s country , oil , oil : they disappear , and that &apos;s going to go soon , and if we don &apos;t disappear from this mess of this mess , we also disappear .
So the question is , can we do that ? I think it &apos;s already ?
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country living without the country .
I think we can provide this world with energy that they can &apos;t yet .
I really believe that , and no , this is not a <unk> .
But this keeps me awake at night -- one of the things I wake up at night , and we have no progress in progress , like now , never really needed .
And we &apos;ve never been able to use it so well , it &apos;s like we can today .
We are at the cusp of amazing , amazing events in many places , but I really think that there must be hundreds of 300 years prior to the Enlightenment in order to find a time we have progress in terms of progress in which we have <unk> more <unk> than now .
People <unk> in their faith , and it &apos;s so scary that you can &apos;t liberate them .
It &apos;s not even the truth .
And listen , everybody has a right to your mind , even a right to your mind .
But you know what you don &apos;t ?
They have no right to their own facts . &apos; <unk> , don &apos;t .
And I took a little time to see this .
About a decade ago , I wrote an article about &quot; The New Yorker &quot; -- a little article .
And I was amazed to resist resistance against resistance to what &apos;s the end of the effective health in health in human history .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I always did , I wrote an article .
And soon after that I wrote a story about cellular food .
The same thing , just bigger .
People were laughing .
So , I also wrote an article , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought it was like , &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules were in a particular way of life to a particular kind of a random manner in nature .
But you know , I &apos;m doing what I &apos;m doing . I wrote the article , I was doing this .
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist .
We type , we &apos;re going to go to a level , we go to eat food , this is okay .
But this article was worried , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and I couldn &apos;t figure it out .
And this is because this <unk> that I didn &apos;t actually have any <unk> at all .
These were <unk> people , <unk> people , <unk> people .
They were just like people in this room .
And this was getting me to this point --
But then I thought , you know , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
We are at a time where we have no capacity for progress as well .
We are talking about <unk> .
We are ironic , with little <unk> about this : &quot; advance . &quot;
Okay , there is some reasons , and I think we know what this is .
We have this confidence in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science of literacy , and there is no reason why this should not be like that .
You can just give a few names and people will understand .
Chernobyl , <unk> , the Challenger , <unk> , weapons of mass production .
I mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
There are questions and problems with people who we thought they were having , they &apos;ve always had that .
Ask questions , require your evidence , give you evidence .
Don &apos;t say anything like that .
But now , there &apos;s this : If you have evidence , you have to take this evidence , and it &apos;s not good .
And I can say this from the reason that we live in an epidemic of fear of fear , like I &apos;ve never seen again .
About 12 years ago , a story was published a story , a horrific story that was <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> vaccine .
Very <unk> .
<unk> studies were done to see whether this was true .
<unk> studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
The data came in .
The data came from the United States , from Sweden , from Sweden , from Canada , and they were all alike , no correlation , no connection , no .
It doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we think of anecdotes , we think what we see is that we can see what we &apos;re seeing , what &apos;s causing us to see what causes us .
We don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a <unk> that we have , and I understand this , I think , I think , all that .
But you know what ?
The result was <unk> .
<unk> because of this fact , America is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> for <unk> goes down .
That &apos;s <unk> and we should be ashamed .
It &apos;s terrible .
What &apos;s happening is that we could do this .
Now , I understand this . That &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
Why is this ?
Does any one single in the audience to see someone dying ?
Not very often .
<unk> in this country , not , but <unk> times in the last year .
These are many deaths from <unk> , 20 per hour .
But because this isn &apos;t going to happen , we can put it in there , and it can be people like that , and people like Jenny can go to love and <unk> through platforms like Oprah and Larry King .
And they can do it , because they don &apos;t connect and connection .
You don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the <unk> .
And this is something that we need to learn , and very quickly .
This guy was a hero , Jonas <unk> .
He was projecting out of one of the worst nightmares of humanity .
No fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The guy in the middle is not so much .
He &apos;s called Paul <unk> .
He &apos;s just developing some other people developed .
He can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
Pretty good , right ?
Now , this is good , besides being able to talk about Paul <unk> and over vaccines , and how valuable they are , and people should stop <unk> .
And that &apos;s actually what it does .
So Paul is a terrorist .
When Paul can talk to a public health talk , he can &apos;t tell us without the armed guards .
There are phone calls home because people like to tell him that they know where their kids go to school .
And why ? Because Paul has a vaccine .
I don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are <unk> .
You take them away , reverse the diseases back , horrible diseases , and this happens to happen .
We have this country now in this country .
And this becomes worse , and pretty soon kids will die , because this is just a question of numbers .
And they &apos;re not just going to die down .
What about <unk> ? Let &apos;s take this . Why not ?
A <unk> of mine was writing a few weeks ago , and I think it &apos;s a little bit of <unk> .
No one has ever said before .
She would not vaccinate her child to <unk> . No case .
<unk> .
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have a <unk> . And you know what ?
We had no <unk> in this country .
Today , I don &apos;t know , maybe I was going to take someone in Lagos on a plane and go to a plane and just go to Los Angeles , right ?
And in a few hours , he goes to a car , and he &apos;s going to go to Long Beach , and he &apos;s coming to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to go one of those <unk> <unk> tonight .
And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s the world &apos;s world .
That &apos;s the planet that we live in . Don &apos;t pretend that it &apos;s not .
We love it to <unk> ourselves . We love that .
Have you ever taken all your <unk> ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that you can help you out .
I know you &apos;ve done this because half of the Americans does this every day .
You take this stuff , and they take an alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , like , they &apos;re useless .
The data back all this time .
They <unk> your urine ; they &apos;re almost never .
That &apos;s all you want to pay for 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
I agree with you .
<unk> urine . dark .
Why do we do this ? Why is this ?
Well , I think I understand -- we hate the diet .
We hate a too strong government . We have no trust in the system .
And this is not supposed to be well . Our healthcare system is <unk> .
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
It &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> ourselves that can afford it .
So we go away from before , and where is where we go ?
We go to the arms of the <unk> .
That &apos;s great . I love the <unk> .
But you know , this is a serious issue , because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
And I have all sorts of artifacts here .
<unk> -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because I don &apos;t know what this is , but we spend billions of dollars on it , this is cheating .
And you know what ? When I tell this , people scream up and say , &quot; What is it ? Do you go to what they want .
That &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
And you know what ? You &apos;ve misunderstood .
Because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to use the evidence of my experts not take up , &quot; or any of the <unk> who want to use his patient with <unk> .
If you go to this way , when you go to and replace it , it &apos;s going to replace your magic and science and go to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
You get to <unk> <unk> in South Africa .
He was 400,000 of his people , because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , are much more effective than antiretroviral AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that is worse than any other of this disease .
Don &apos;t tell me that those things have consequences .
They have them . They always have it .
Now , the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re right there , this is this absurd struggle between the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
That &apos;s a <unk> debate . You have to stop .
It &apos;s a debate about words , over metaphors .
This is ideology , not science .
Everything we eat , every time we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every <unk> , was changed by the people .
You know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
There was no <unk> . There was no <unk> . We did all this .
We &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
And some of those things have worked and some things .
We &apos;re <unk> what &apos;s not working .
Now , we can make it more accurate , and there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin A in rice , and this stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , millions of people to raise their lives .
You don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to say that I don &apos;t understand .
We <unk> <unk> food .
Why are we doing this ?
Now , what I &apos;m all listening to is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields that are wrong .
We don &apos;t want to think that companies can patent lives .
We don &apos;t want companies that have seeds .
And you know what &apos;s my answer all this ?
Yes , you have right . Let &apos;s do that .
It &apos;s true , we have a huge impact , but this isn &apos;t science .
That &apos;s nothing to do with science .
It &apos;s right , morality , morality .
You know , the science is no business .
She &apos;s not a country .
She &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process , and sometimes it &apos;s going to work , and sometimes it &apos;s not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t be able to do , because we have a death of science because we fear millions of them , and millions of people .
You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;ve got to grow 70 percent more food than currently . Seventy percent .
This investment in Africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
You need this , and we don &apos;t give them it .
And why ? <unk> changed food .
We don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> stuff .
<unk> is something that is a half billion people eat .
It &apos;s like a potato .
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories . It &apos;s <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have any nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists all are doing this .
And then people could eat this and would not be blind .
You wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
That would be beautiful . It wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
And all what I can say is , why do we have this ?
I mean , we ask ourselves , why do we do this ?
Because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
It &apos;s not about genes ; it &apos;s not about chemicals .
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our food pyramid to better food , better food , food food .
It &apos;s not about Rice <unk> , it &apos;s about to get people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what this means .
Because you know what ?
If we don &apos;t do that , if we don &apos;t do that we &apos;re going to do such as we do so we do not want to be guilty , I don &apos;t want to be guilty of high-tech colonialism .
There &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
It &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we need to really stop this .
After this incredible fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; You &apos;re going to still go to this ridiculous time and go to the future ? &quot;
Anyway , I want to go to every case .
At the moment , it &apos;s in present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
We can do this time machine , what we want to do .
We can <unk> them , where we want to go to it , and we &apos;re going to go to them where we want to go .
We have to lead those conversations , and we need to think , but if we go back to time machine , we &apos;re going to be glad we &apos;d be glad .
I know that we can , and as far as it comes to me , it &apos;s something that needs to now .
Thank you . Thank you .
When Steve <unk> , <unk> of the Los Angeles Times , a day after the streets of Los Angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
She came from a man , a guy named <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who played on a violin , which was just two strings .
Many of you will know the story of the story , because it was a book that was later a book that was <unk> , with Robert <unk> junior , like Steve <unk> and Jamie <unk> as a <unk> professor who was studied by the <unk> of his <unk> schizophrenia , the <unk> of his <unk> .
<unk> removed at Juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later he was living on the streets of <unk> Row in the center of Los Angeles .
I encourage you all to read <unk> &apos;s book or to look at the movie , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connection between those two men , but also how the music was going to be able to use half , and how it was the instrument that was allowed to be able to go away from the street .
I met Mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the Walt Disney Hall .
He had a demonstration of <unk> first and <unk> <unk> and came back behind this stage to me .
He was talking to a very <unk> and <unk> note about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton , and how the <unk> never could ever go into the baseball world , and this was all the <unk> &apos;s late edition of the first violin of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We came to talk about music , and a few days later , I got an email that was interested in <unk> .
I have to say , I have to say that <unk> treatment was a medical treatment , because it was already with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , a trauma he was following his life .
As a result , there are now particularly vulnerable to these <unk> stages , which is sometimes so bad that it would threaten it and <unk> it , and it &apos;s going to disappear throughout the streets of <unk> Row , <unk> the horror of the horror of their mind .
And in fact , this was a <unk> that was <unk> when we first started with our first <unk> <unk> Hall in the Walt Disney Hall , and he had a completely lost <unk> in his eyes , and this was completely lost .
He was talking about invisible demons and smoke and how someone was trying to poison him .
I was scared , not <unk> , but I was afraid he could lose it in one of its states , and I was able to break it down to the violin of the violin , when I first started talking about <unk> and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> .
So I just started playing .
I played the first sentence by <unk> <unk> .
And while I was playing it , I noticed that in <unk> eyes , there was a <unk> change .
It was as if it was under the impact of the impact of a invisible <unk> , a chemical reaction that was a catalyst .
<unk> abstract anger was transformed into understanding , in a quiet curiosity , and grace .
And as a miracle , it took his violin , and started to listen to some <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and then asked me to go to the end : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
We started talking to talk about music , just from playing over a playing over Beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other things that go to <unk> <unk> .
And I realized that it was not just a compelling knowledge about music , but it was also related to her personal personal connection .
He was talking about a passion , and a way to understand that I only had my colleagues in the <unk> of Los Angeles .
By playing music , he was talking about music , it was out of this <unk> , <unk> Man , who was moved through the streets of Los Angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , at <unk> <unk> musicians .
Music is medicine . Music is changing .
For <unk> music , music means health .
Because the music allows him to go , his thoughts and <unk> with his imagination and creativity in something like this .
And that &apos;s how he <unk> his <unk> .
I understood that that &apos;s the nature of art .
That &apos;s why this is the reason we make music : that it &apos;s going to be inside all of us , deep inside of us , our emotions , through our ability to shape our artistic lens through reality .
And the reality of this expression is that all of us , and it &apos;s moving , inspired us .
What was <unk> , so it brought the music back to a community of friends .
The <unk> force of music was brought back into a family of musicians that understood his talent and his talent .
And I &apos;ll ever come back with <unk> <unk> , whether it &apos;s the Walt Disney Hall or <unk> Row , because it reminds me that I was having a musician .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Thank you . Thank you .
Robert <unk> .
Robert <unk> : I want to play a little bit of play that I have ever stolen .
I hope you forgive me .
I &apos;m Jane <unk> . I design video games .
I &apos;ve been developing 10 years old , and my goal for the next decade , and my goal for the next decade , is to save the world in the reality of how to save this in <unk> .
I have a plan for that , and I want to convince you , I want to convince you more people , including everybody else &apos;s play and <unk> games .
At the moment , we spend three billion hours a week .
Some of you might think , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time games . &quot;
Maybe a lot of time , if you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world ?
But in fact , my research at the Institute for the future for the future is exactly the opposite .
Three billion hours a week , are not nearly enough to solve the <unk> problems of the world .
In fact , I &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive on this planet in this planet , we have to extend that time .
I calculated that it took the time that it took the time to 21 billion hours per week .
This may seem to be able to take a little bit more <unk> , so that it can be true : if we look at problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global warming and obesity , I think we should try to play games for at least 21 billion hours a week .
till the end of the decade , I &apos;m really serious .
Why ?
So why I think that games are so essential to the survival of the survival of human species in the future .
This is a <unk> photographer <unk> <unk> .
He was trying to capture the emotions during play , so it &apos;s a camera that was built on a camera .
This is one of the classical expressions in terms of play .
If you don &apos;t , if you &apos;re not a player , you might not be able to find some of the nuances in this picture .
You probably see this sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but also <unk> concentration , <unk> concentration , a very difficult problem .
If you &apos;re also playing , you see some of those <unk> eyes that look up , and the mouth of optimism is a sign of optimism .
This is a player who &apos;s on the edge of something called the <unk> <unk> .
Oh , you know this . OK . All right .
So we have some players here .
A <unk> victory is a result which is so powerful that you didn &apos;t even know it was possible .
It was almost beyond the imagination .
You can actually be able to actually be able to do that . This is a <unk> victory .
And this is a <unk> victory for a <unk> victory .
And this is what we have to see on millions of faces from <unk> around the world , when we take the hurdles of the next century , and the face of those that will fall into the edge of a <unk> .
Well , unfortunately , we see more of this face in real life , if we &apos;re facing difficult problems .
I refer to it as this &quot; I am bad . &quot;
And it &apos;s my face , see ? Yes ?
That &apos;s me , like , I know , I &apos;m bad .
This is a graffiti in my former home of Berkeley in Berkeley , California , where I was studying why we &apos;re in games better than in real life than in real life .
That &apos;s a problem that many players have .
We think we &apos;re not in the reality of reality like play .
And I don &apos;t only mean less successful , even though it belongs to it .
We can reach into <unk> .
I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , what &apos;s interesting is to do with motivation , inspired by collaboration .
If we &apos;re in a <unk> , I think that many of us in our best version of our best version are going to be able to go back and <unk> the problem with this problem , so it &apos;s going to try to try to take the problem after the <unk> .
And in reality , if we fail , when we hit obstacles , we often feel differently .
We feel overwhelmed . We feel overwhelmed . We feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
These feelings have never , if we play games , they don &apos;t have it .
And this is what I want to look at like <unk> .
Why is it possible in games impossible to think , you couldn &apos;t just achieve all of it ?
How can we take these emotions out of the reality ?
So I was watching games like World of Warcraft that allow the appropriate environment to create the environment of problem-solving .
And I &apos;ve discovered some things that have this epic <unk> in <unk> possible .
So first , if you go to one of this <unk> game , especially at World of Warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to put you on a <unk> mission , and it &apos;s instantly .
But not just any of the mission , but it &apos;s a mission that perfectly appropriate at your level , right ?
So you can do this .
You &apos;re never going to be able to fix it .
But always at the edge of your body , so you have to do well .
But there &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft . You don &apos;t sit around , and you don &apos;t sit around . There &apos;s always going to be something important .
And there &apos;s <unk> staff .
Wherever you &apos;re going to go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with you to join your epic mission .
That &apos;s not so easy in true life , this feeling of life , this feeling that at a <unk> <unk> .
Furthermore , this epic story , this inspirational story , why we &apos;re there , and what we have is that we have to do this all positive feedback .
You know , they &apos;ve heard of level of level , and &quot; + one strength . &quot;
That &apos;s the constant feedback that &apos;s not in true life .
When I leave this stage , I didn &apos;t have -- + 1 speech , and a crazy idea , 20 crazy idea .
I don &apos;t get really a life of that feedback .
So , the problem of how World of Warcraft , like World of Warcraft , is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be at any time on the edge of a <unk> <unk> that we &apos;d rather spend our time in this <unk> .
They &apos;re just better than the reality .
Today , every World world has spent millions of <unk> million years trying to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
That &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
It may sound bad .
But to see it in the context of the context : <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> began going upright .
So it &apos;s the first <unk> primate .
So , if we talk about how much time we spend on playing games , it only makes sense of time , when you look at the time in terms of human evolution , what &apos;s extremely unusual .
But it &apos;s also appropriate , because it turns out that we can use this whole time to play , actually , to change what we are as human beings .
We evolve to be cooperative , very different creatures .
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s the truth .
Let &apos;s look at this interesting statistic recently from a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University : The average young man of today &apos;s in a country with powerful <unk> has 10,000 hours ago with the 21st century .
So , 10,000 hours , is an extremely interesting number , for two reasons .
First of all , for children in the United States , they have spent more hours teaching the scores that they spend in school , from the high school class to the high school -- if you have no money . So we have this whole thing .
<unk> that young people like to learn what it means to be able to be a good player , like everything else that they go to school .
And maybe some of you have this new book of Malcolm <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot; So you &apos;ve read your theory of success , the idea of the success of the performance of 10,000 hours .
It &apos;s based on the great study of research that &apos;s when we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> study with the 21st century until the 21st century is to live in the 21st century .
We &apos;re going to be able to do whatever we want to do as well as the most significant people in the world .
So what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
So the big question is , &quot; What are you doing are <unk> ? &quot;
Because if we could figure it out , we could have never existed in the way that we could ever have human potential .
So many people have currently spent time in the world that spend at least one hour with <unk> .
These are our <unk> . 500 million people that are extraordinary in &quot; Something . &quot;
And in the next decade , we have another billion players who are also extremely good at which .
If you haven &apos;t heard it ?
The <unk> developed , <unk> <unk> , the energy and work on <unk> , that players can play around the world , especially in India , in India , China , Brazil , Brazil .
You should expect some more than one billion players in the next decade .
That &apos;s all 1.5 billion players .
So I started to think what it is , what it &apos;s doing to <unk> these games .
Here are four things I found . The first thing : <unk> .
OK , imagine this as extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do right now to do a challenge with the belief that we have a hopeful hope for success .
Well , I always believe that there &apos;s no doubt that a powerful victory can be possible , and it &apos;s always the same thing .
players don &apos;t sit around .
<unk> are masters in the spiders are social networks .
There is a lot of interesting studies that show that we may like to see people more like we have played with them , even when they have a severe bit of pain .
The reason for this is that it requires a lot of faith to play with someone playing a game .
We trust that someone is spending time with us , that the rules are going to become <unk> , that we have the same target .
So it allows the <unk> to grow by bonds , trust and cooperation .
As a result , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . Fantastic !
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> or <unk> 22 hours a week , like <unk> 22 hours a week .
The reason is that if we play , we actually are actually happier to work on hard if we don &apos;t .
We know that as human beings , as human beings , we &apos;re doing hard doing hard work .
And players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
And ultimately , epic meanings .
The players love to become a part of the <unk> missions that are going to be critical .
Here &apos;s a <unk> to put this in the right light -- you know , all Wikipedia , you know , all Wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
The second largest <unk> of the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> <unk> is the World of Warcraft .
Five million people use it every month .
They have more information about World of Warcraft in the Internet than any of World of Warcraft in the world than any other than any different aspects of the world .
They create a epic story .
They create an epic source of knowing about the World of Warcraft .
Okay , so this is four <unk> that lead to a result . players are <unk> , <unk> individuals .
These are people who think they can change the world as individuals .
And the only problem is they think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
That &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
Edward <unk> is a <unk> .
His work is brilliant .
People spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
And he says , &quot; We are going to witness the witnesses like a <unk> of virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
And this of an economist . So it &apos;s logical .
And he &apos;s saying ... not like I ... I develop games , I &apos;m making games .
So he says that it actually makes sense , because players can actually achieve more than in real life than in real life .
They can create stronger social ties like in real life than in real life , and they get more feedback in play than in real life .
So he says , it &apos;s a moment of moment in the world that players spend more time in the virtual world than in real time .
I agree with this , which is logical .
But it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
We need to begin to create the real world in a game .
My inspiration comes from the one that was 2,500 years ago .
There &apos;s these ancient cubes , from <unk> . You know ?
This fantastic <unk> was there was <unk> .
And this was , like , the first of human beings developed , and if you &apos;re familiar with the old Greek Greek <unk> , you know , you know , you know , this story , you know , this story . The story about how it &apos;s made .
In fact , <unk> have been played games , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> was invented by famine .
<unk> was there was such a big famine that the king of <unk> came to a crazy idea .
People were suffering . People fought .
It was an extreme situation . You needed an extreme solution .
So they invented it , according to <unk> and <unk> a national strategy , a way to eat . The next day you would play .
And they would be like a <unk> that would be <unk> , because games so intriguing and <unk> , <unk> , so that they would forget that there would be nothing to eat .
And then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
And according to <unk> , they survived these 18 years long after they ate a day and played the next .
In the same way , I think we have a games today .
We play games a way to get rid of the suffering of the real world . We create games to avoid everything in the real world , which doesn &apos;t really work in real life , and we need to take what we need from the play .
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
That &apos;s the <unk> .
According to <unk> , 18 years was not better at 18 years ago , so the king , one of the last <unk> <unk> .
They divided the Kingdom of two camps .
They played a <unk> , and the <unk> were allowed to disrupt a <unk> adventure .
You know , they were leaving <unk> and trying to find out a new home , so many people who were food to survive , and they were looking for the rest of the world that they could thrive .
That sounds crazy , right ?
But the latest <unk> show shows that the <unk> kingdom , later the <unk> realm , the same DNA as the old <unk> .
So recently , scientists have come to believe that <unk> story actually is true .
And geologists found evidence of a global <unk> that took almost 20 years to explain what could be possible .
So this crazy story could agree .
In fact , they actually saved their people by play by games for 18 years , and they had 18 years old in games , and then they had a lot of work learned that they saved the whole civilization .
So , we can also .
We &apos;ve ever played all of World of Warcraft .
This was the first time in real time .
That &apos;s the World of <unk> . That was 16 years ago .
They played 18 years for 18 years , we &apos;ve been sitting there for over 16 years .
I &apos;m saying , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
So , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , so I take my 21 billion times a week .
We should argue that we should spend half an hour each day with play , until we have the problems of the real world .
I know you &apos;re going to say , &quot; How do we solve problems of real world ? &quot;
In fact , this question is that I have dedicated to my work in the last few years at the Institute for the future .
We have this <unk> in our office in Palo Alto , it &apos;s how to understand the future .
We don &apos;t want to try to say the future .
What we want to do is create the future .
We want to imagine the best way to think , and then humans will empower the way to take this idea into reality .
We imagine epic <unk> <unk> and giving people the opportunity to reach them .
So I &apos;m going to show you just three games that I designed to try to give people epic <unk> <unk> in their own future .
This is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
The game is 2007 .
It &apos;s a <unk> where you have to overcome a <unk> .
The <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it &apos;s going to be your real life .
how it &apos;s affected by how transportation is <unk> , and you have to figure out how to create your real life if it was true , and we ask them to write about blogging videos or <unk> .
We tested this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve spent her over the last three years .
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience .
No one wants to be able to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
But if you go to a <unk> adventure and say , &quot; We go to the oil . &quot;
That &apos;s a fascinating adventure that &apos;s going to go .
Let &apos;s find out how to survive , and most of our players have the <unk> behaviors .
So , we have a bigger impact for the next <unk> game than just <unk> .
We developed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the center of the future .
The point is that the calculation of a <unk> is that people have 23 years on the planet .
This supercomputer is called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The call for players to <unk> , we have designed like a <unk> <unk> .
You know , you know , Jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s the <unk> . You have the astronauts , the scientists , the scientists , they can save the world .
But in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody &apos;s in <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future of energy , food , health , security , security , and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played this game eight weeks .
They came up with 500 creative solutions that you can read when you go to <unk> .
And the last game we take on the third March . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank .
If you finish the game , you &apos;ll get to the World Bank award for the World Peace prize .
We &apos;re working with universities in the country in the country , and invite them to learn a new social media .
We have a comic book . We have a level of it . We have level for <unk> understanding , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
And I want you to invite you all to share this game with young people , around the world , especially in <unk> that benefit from being able to bring together their own social companies to save the world .
I come to this end .
Let me tell you something .
What is the next thing ?
We have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the world yet .
Well , I hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big difference for transformation .
We have all these kinds of <unk> , <unk> productivity , the ability to create dense social networks , <unk> , <unk> meaning .
But I really hope that we play major games together to survive on this planet in a living century .
And I hope you &apos;ll play this game with me and play it .
In the next decade , I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to be able to be able to create any more of the future that we can create , and that we can play all kinds of games , so I &apos;m going to be able to play the <unk> games !
Thank you .
Now , for some time , I &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> . It may seem strange that a magician might be interested in it , because it &apos;s like , like , a <unk> that goes to a <unk> when someone only gets enough of it .
In other words , <unk> have been shown in some studies of studies , a <unk> effect , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks what &apos;s going to happen is a <unk> or a sort of -- In the <unk> , for example , if the patient is enough enough on the body , it &apos;s called a <unk> effect in the body .
A <unk> gets to a little bit of <unk> , because it &apos;s like this .
So with each other , we understand each other , I want to tell you a little bit about the elemental trick .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . That &apos;s a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s .
I learned this from the <unk> of the <unk> in the 1970s .
I &apos;m going to take it for you and then explain it .
And then I &apos;ll explain why I explain it .
So , see what happens .
The knife that you can investigate ; my hand that you can look at .
I &apos;m just going to keep this knife .
I <unk> my sleeves .
And to make sure that nothing &apos;s going to disappear from my sleeve , it comes out , I &apos;ll just take my wrist right here .
In this way , you can see that it &apos;s not going to move anything like this , and as long as I can <unk> here , nothing can go into my sleeve , or come out .
And the goal here is very simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes fine , it &apos;s going to hold the knife by my bare physical magnetism .
It &apos;s actually so that it &apos;s so solid that I can shake it without the knife .
Nothing moves to my sleeve , or comes out , no <unk> . And you can go to everything .
<unk> !
Now , this is a trick that I often give you little kids that are interested in magic , because you can really learn a lot about deception , if you look carefully , even though it &apos;s a very easy trick .
You probably know , many of you know this trick in this room .
He works like this .
I &apos;m holding this knife .
I &apos;ll tell you that I <unk> my wrist to make sure that nothing goes away from my sleeves or coming out , and this is a lie .
The reason I <unk> my wrist is that it &apos;s the secret to the illusion of illusion .
Because , in the moment , I want you to put my hand away from you , so you can see them from behind the back of the back of this room , my <unk> , just from there , where it was so <unk> .
<unk> trick ?
There &apos;s someone who &apos;s never had a childhood .
So it &apos;s there . Exactly .
And when I look back , the fingers changed its position .
And now , you might be able to talk about why it &apos;s a delusion , why you don &apos;t notice that there are three fingers , because the mind and the way that it doesn &apos;t matter , one , two , three , it &apos;s one , three , but it &apos;s as a group .
But this isn &apos;t really about it , and then I open my hand .
Of course it &apos;s going to hold it , but not by the magnetism &apos;s magnetism , but through a trick , through my <unk> that &apos;s there .
And when I close my hand , the same thing happens to me , the same thing , by the way , is hidden away from this movement .
I take this hand away , and this is the knife .
So this trick is to share your friends and neighbors . Thank you .
Now what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
A year ago , a year ago , I was reading a study that was completely straight away .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why this was an amazing thing .
But it turns out , if you put a placebo in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a <unk> pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a certain amount of measurable effect .
But if you give the form that you put the dopamine receptor on , for example , for example , in a smaller pill , it &apos;s going to change this blue pill , and it turns out that they &apos;re actually measurable more effectively .
And , even though none of the <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
What ? This made me crazy .
But it turned out that this is not all this .
If you take <unk> , they &apos;re more effective than any shape of any shape .
A coffee capsule that &apos;s yellow , and the other red is better than a white capsule .
The <unk> plays a role .
A pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- I can &apos;t remind you the statistics . I &apos;m sorry .
But it &apos;s important .
That &apos;s also the <unk> play .
And the shape plays a role .
And if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach the needle .
Right ? One syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance , which is a patient .
This is a very powerful image in your mind , this is a much stronger pill than a white pill .
This chart is really -- I &apos;m going to show you a different time when we have a <unk> .
So in fact , the white pill doesn &apos;t seem to be as good as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t like that as a capsule , like a capsule that doesn &apos;t like the needle .
And none of them have any kind of <unk> quality , it &apos;s just our belief that this is a stronger impact .
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a trick .
I take something that is a delusion , and it really looks like this .
We know that this study has to reach the needle , when it &apos;s supposed to go to the thing .
This is 18 inches long ago . It &apos;s very , very <unk> , and I &apos;m going to start it first a little bit of <unk> .
That &apos;s really my flesh . It &apos;s not <unk> special flesh .
This is my skin . This is not a <unk> of Hollywood .
So I &apos;m going to put this needle into my skin , and it goes through them until they go back to the other side .
If you &apos;re going to fall -- if you fall into <unk> -- I showed it a few friends in the hotel room , and some people that I didn &apos;t know , and some people that I didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s a woman has become almost <unk> .
So , I &apos;m suggesting that if you &apos;re going to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , look for the next 30 seconds , or you know , you know , I &apos;m going to end the first <unk> part of here .
You can see , you can see , you can see , you can <unk> , if you like .
So , this is what this is like , right here , where my flesh starts , the lower portion of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
I &apos;m sorry . Do you mind ?
And now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side of my skin .
Now , we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the <unk> .
about that .
But now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
So , I &apos;m going to show you . That &apos;s one , two , three , four , five .
Well ,
I know what people think when they see it .
They say , &quot; Okay , it &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> yourself to have the skin just a few minutes long . &quot;
Now , I &apos;m going to show you .
What does this look like ? Pretty good .
Yes , I know . And people say , &quot; Okay . I haven &apos;t seen that . &quot;
The people in the <unk> are now coming .
Let me tell you about that .
That &apos;s really my skin . This is not a <unk> of Hollywood .
That &apos;s my flesh , and I can <unk> it .
I &apos;m sorry . If you &apos;re going to get a little , look away , look away .
The people at the back of the time , they &apos;ll see that at some time , you &apos;ll see , &quot; Well , that &apos;s quite impressive , but if it really would look , this is a hole , and here , if it really was , it would bleed it . &quot;
Okay , let me tell you a little bit about you .
Yes , here &apos;s it .
Normally , I would pick up the needle .
I would clean my arm and show you that there are no lesions .
But I think in this context , in this context , I think it &apos;s going to make some <unk> , I &apos;m going to just take the needle and go from the stage .
We &apos;re going to come back to the next few days .
I hope you &apos;re enjoying it . Thank you .
So I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I just loved two .
This first one , this was more like a passionate <unk> .
It was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
What &apos;s a fish .
even better , he was born into <unk> &apos;s meant to be raised by sustainability standards .
So you could feel comfortable with him .
I had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
One day called the CEO of the company and asked if I could argue about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; Of course . &quot;
So here &apos;s a firm that was trying to solve what this is this incredible problem for our chefs . How do we have a fish on our <unk> ?
In the last 50 years , we didn &apos;t have the ocean &apos;s ocean as we have defeated forests .
It &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , which is that the tuna , the tuna , the <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
It &apos;s almost nothing left .
So it &apos;s going to be a little bit of <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
There &apos;s a lot of arguments about that , <unk> the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , and they &apos;re inefficient , one big disadvantage .
He &apos;s about 15 to one .
That &apos;s what &apos;s called 15 pounds of <unk> .
Not very sustainable .
<unk> is not very good .
So here was a company that was trying to make it right .
I was supportive .
The day before the event , I called the CEO of the <unk> for the company .
Don &apos;t call it .
&quot; Don . &quot; I said , &quot; Just to have the facts right , you &apos;re familiar with the fact that you &apos;re familiar with the sea in the ocean that you don &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; We are so high out of the waste of our fish , not concentrated . &quot;
And then he added , &quot; We &apos;re essentially a world .
This <unk> from 2.5 to one .
&quot; The best way . &quot;
2.5 are one , great .
&quot; That &apos;s one ? What does you grow ? &quot;
<unk> proteins , he said .
&quot; Great . &quot; I said .
And that night , I was sitting in bed and thinking , what &apos;s a sustainable protein ?
So I called the next day , just before the event , Don &apos;t .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t , what for example ? &quot;
He said he didn &apos;t know he was there .
Now , I <unk> with some people in the company . No one was able to give me a <unk> answer , until I finally was with the senior biologists .
Let &apos;s call it not .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; for example , you know , for example ?
Now , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; How much percentage <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
maybe two percent .
&quot; That &apos;s about about 30 percent . &quot;
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t , what &apos;s this going on ? &quot;
There was a long breaks in the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s a lot of you in the world . &quot;
I <unk> from this fish .
No , not because I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
That &apos;s me .
No , I actually have a <unk> of this fish out of this fish because , I swear to God , after this conversation after chicken .
This second fish , this is a different type of <unk> .
It &apos;s the romantic way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , your fish learn your fish , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
I ate it first in a restaurant in <unk> .
A <unk> journalist had spoken for this fish .
It has a <unk> .
He came up to the table with a bright orange white color .
The chef had sold it .
Shut up .
<unk> was still delicious .
Who can actually taste a fish like that well after he was sold ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
We call it Miguel . In fact , Miguel .
And no , he didn &apos;t buy the fish and it &apos;s not a chef . At least in the way that you and I understand it .
He &apos;s a biologist at <unk> La <unk> .
This is a <unk> in the <unk> corner .
She &apos;s near the <unk> of the river .
By the end of the 1980s , this was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
They raised <unk> on what was essentially <unk> .
They did this by taking the country <unk> .
They built this complicated series of channels of canals , and they raised water from the country to the river .
Well , they couldn &apos;t make any difference , not economically .
And it was ecologically a catastrophe .
It took about 90 percent of the birds that are many birds .
And in 1982 , a Spanish company was buying the country .
What did they do ?
They have the stream of water on the stream .
They literally have the lever .
Instead , they used to use the water to use it to use the water back to the water .
They <unk> the channels .
They created an 11,000 acres of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , shrimp , <unk> -- and all of his company , the ecological devastation completely .
This is incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
They stare at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all they &apos;re seeing are <unk> channels and this dense , <unk> march .
I was no longer there in time with Miguel .
He &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts Charles Darwin , and this is a &quot; A crocodile in <unk> . &quot;
Okay ? There we were , and we fought through the <unk> and I was <unk> and <unk> , <unk> up till my knees , and Miguel <unk> .
Here &apos;s a rare <unk> .
So he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
And here , there &apos;s a pattern of <unk> that remembers the <unk> giraffe .
It turns out that Miguel has spent the largest part of his career in Africa in Africa .
I asked him how to become a <unk> .
He said , &quot; Fish ? I don &apos;t know about fish .
I &apos;m an expert of relationships . &quot;
And it goes back and goes to more <unk> of rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
And don &apos;t get me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , like this .
It &apos;s great , but I was in love .
And my head was weak about this selling piece of <unk> <unk> that I had on the <unk> .
So I was interrupted , and I said , &quot; Miguel , what &apos;s it coming out of your way ? &quot;
He showed up on the algae .
&quot; I know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , which is incredible .
But what &apos;s your fish ?
What is the <unk> ? &quot;
Now , he continues to tell me that it &apos;s such a <unk> system that was eating the fish which they would eat in the wild .
The <unk> biomass , which is the phytoplankton , is that it feeds the fishes .
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
There is no food .
You know , you know about a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
Later on , I was driving around this site with Miguel , and I asked him , &quot; To be a place which seems natural to be , &quot; different than any farm I was ever , &quot; How are you going to succeed ? &quot;
At the moment , it was as if there was a <unk> that would require a <unk> <unk> .
And we have flipped around the corner , and we saw the most incredible sight , thousands and <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a literally continuous <unk> carpet so far .
&quot; That &apos;s success . &quot;
&quot; Look at your <unk> , pink .
She &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? I was completely confused .
So I said , &quot; Miguel , don &apos;t they tell you ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
So last year , 600,000 birds , there was more than 250 different types .
It &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private communities in Europe .
I said , &quot; Miguel , it &apos;s a good <unk> is not the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
He shook his head , no .
He said , &quot; We build <unk> . &quot;
This is a <unk> network .
The <unk> eat the <unk> .
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
So , you know , the <unk> are the better system . &quot;
Okay , let &apos;s rethink this : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measure their success at the health of their predators .
A <unk> , but also a <unk> .
Oh , and by the way , that &apos;s not supposed to be there .
They breed 240 kilometers away from 240 feet , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
Every morning they fly 240 feet every year .
And every night they go to 240 kilometers .
They make it , because they can follow the white white line of the <unk> line .
Seriously .
So I had introduced a journey of the penguins , so I was sitting there .
I said , &quot; Miguel , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm and then they fly 240 miles back ?
Do they do that ? &quot;
He looked at me as a song of Whitney Houston .
He said , &quot; No . You do this because the food is better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious , and I don &apos;t like a <unk> . I don &apos;t like them .
It &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
I almost never <unk> .
And yet , when I tried it in this restaurant , they didn &apos;t even have to go to <unk> <unk> .
She &apos;s fried , and it would take a bite off the ocean .
So I mentioned this to Miguel and <unk> .
He said , &quot; The skin is like a <unk> .
She &apos;s the last <unk> before the body .
She evolved over evolution to evolve <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And then he added , &quot; But our water has no <unk> . &quot;
Okay , a farm that &apos;s not feeding their fish ; a farm they measure their success on their success .
And then it was clear when he said , if he said , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , because the water that goes through this farm from this farm .
It &apos;s a river which causes all of these things to have the rivers of rivers today to lead them to <unk> chemical pollutants .
And when it fought the system through the system , this leaves the water cleaner when it &apos;s <unk> .
The system is so healthy , it cleans water .
So not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measure their success on their own side of their predators , but a farm which is literally a <unk> , and not just for those fish , but for you .
Because when the water goes down to the water , it &apos;s <unk> in the Atlantic .
A drop in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;m going to take it to you , and that should be , because this <unk> , like romantic , is also <unk> .
You could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
What we need is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one where food actually tasted good taste .
But for many people , this is a little too radical .
We &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . We are lover .
We love <unk> . We love little <unk> . We talk about food food . We eat food .
And if you claim that these things are going to be the future of good food , someone will say , &quot; Hey , people , I love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
How are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
Can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t like this question .
No , not because we have enough calories to have enough calories to feed the world .
A billion people will be hungry .
A billion -- this is more than ever before -- because of the <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
Now , I don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s the logic of our evolutionary biology for the last 50 years .
<unk> grain on <unk> , <unk> on <unk> cells , chemicals on earth , and all the time , the <unk> could just say , &quot; If we feed more people cheaper , how awful can this be ? &quot;
That was the cause . It was the <unk> . It was the <unk> of the American agriculture .
We should call them what it is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> that &apos;s going to rapidly <unk> capital , which is able to make that production .
This is not a <unk> , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
Today , our <unk> is threatened by <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
It &apos;s not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through <unk> country , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by <unk> , but through <unk> and nets , but through fish in the ocean .
You want to feed the world ?
Let &apos;s start with the question : How are we going to feed ourselves ?
Or better , how can we create conditions that can enable every community to grow themselves ?
To do this , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
<unk> , chemistry , chemistry , and it never produces a really good food .
Let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
That &apos;s that this is the two billion years of <unk> .
Look Miguel , like Miguel .
Companies that are not worlds to be able to <unk> , which is , instead of <unk> , businesses , which can grow <unk> , instead of just <unk> and <unk> , but experts on relationships .
Because they &apos;re experts who also are experts .
And if I really &apos;m honest , it &apos;s a better chef when I &apos;m you .
You know , this is me right , because if it &apos;s good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
Thank you .
I grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
In my high school , I went to school to school every day for an hour .
And my nose was always stuck in a book , a <unk> that my thoughts in other worlds , and in my mind , <unk> my <unk> , <unk> curiosity .
This curiosity showed up , that I was always when I was not in school , <unk> and <unk> , frogs , snakes and <unk> , all home and <unk> , all home and <unk> , all home .
I was completely <unk> , you know .
It was all about trying to understand the world , and the limits of what &apos;s going to happen .
And my love for science fiction seemed to come out in my environment , because then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon , and we went to the moon to the sea floor .
Jacques Cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world full of wonder that we never could have imagined .
That &apos;s probably good at that <unk> <unk> .
And I was artists .
I was able to draw . I could draw .
And there &apos;s no video games that have this <unk> movies with <unk> movies the whole <unk> movies , and I had to create the images in my mind .
That &apos;s all we had to read , and when we read a book as children , we took the description of the <unk> and <unk> it on the canvas in our heads .
My response was to draw it and painting by aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> , all that .
In the <unk> , I was always caught by the teachers , as I was hiding , hidden behind the Atlantic .
The creativity needed to go out .
And what &apos;s interesting was something interesting , what struck me about Jacques <unk> shows , was this idea of a completely unknown world here on our planet .
Certainly , I would never reach a alien world with a spaceship , which was pretty unlikely .
But here was a world that I could actually go into here , here on Earth , and it was equally fascinating and exotic as all that I had always imagined when I had these books .
So I decided that when I was 15 to become the diver .
The only thing was that I lived in a small village in Canada , 3,000 kilometers away from the nearest ocean .
But I didn &apos;t even take it away .
I <unk> my father until he finally had a <unk> on Buffalo in Buffalo , New York , right , on the other side of the border , where we lived .
I was doing my <unk> at a pole in a pole corner of the winter in Buffalo , New York .
But the ocean , but a real ocean , I just got two years later , when we moved to California .
Since then , in the age of 40 , I spent about three hours underwater , I spent about 3,000 hours underwater . 500 hours of this .
And I learned that the world of the deep sea of ocean , even in the <unk> oceans , is so rich in life , as we can really never imagine .
The imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
To the days , I have this profound awe for what I see on my <unk> .
And my love for the ocean , with the same intensity as eh and you .
When I was an adult as an adult , it was the <unk> .
This seemed the best way to tell , my inner urge to tell stories to tell me how to combine this to <unk> images .
As a child , I just drew <unk> and it &apos;s like .
So , movies , they were able to bring images and <unk> together . That was fit together .
And of course , the stories that I was <unk> out of the <unk> : &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
In &quot; <unk> &quot; , I was able to connect my <unk> and diving with the <unk> .
So , sort of , my two passions are intertwined .
Something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : To solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to create such a way of liquid <unk> -- that &apos;s how we worked on suspended animation .
What it came out was the first <unk> <unk> that you see in a movie .
The film didn &apos;t have any money , well , it just played his <unk> , but I noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like the <unk> of the magic that came out of the magic that came from this .
According to Arthur Clarke &apos;s Law &apos;s Law , you know , you know , <unk> technology and <unk> is not different from each other .
So they saw some <unk> .
And this was really exciting .
And I was thinking to myself , &quot; Wow , this must be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
So we went to see in &quot; Terminator 2 , &quot; my next movie , a lot further .
Together with <unk> , we created this guy from liquid metal , and the success depended on how this effect would hit .
And it worked . Again , we &apos;ve created some <unk> , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we have a little bit more money a little bit more money .
From these two experiences , it came from a completely new world , a whole new world of creativity to <unk> .
So I founded a firm firm called Winston friend Winston , which was that at the time of the best project and <unk> . She was called Digital <unk> .
The idea of this company was it was able to elaborate <unk> processes using visual processing to start with visual processing , etc .
That &apos;s what we did , and that was a time for us to have a time for a time .
But in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we did was we actually founded the company -- too slowly .
I was writing this piece of &quot; Avatar , &quot; which was supposed to be the visual effects of visual effects and <unk> effects in completely new heights , <unk> characters that were being produced by <unk> human , <unk> characters , and the <unk> should be <unk> .
But the <unk> went back quite beautiful , and the people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t able to do that .
So I <unk> this , and I did this other movie over the big vessel that goes down .
The <unk> I was selling this as &quot; Romeo and Julia on a boat . &quot; It was a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of scale .
But in fact , I was actually trying to put it into true <unk> of the Titanic .
That &apos;s why I made this film .
That &apos;s the truth . The studio did not know .
But I was convinced , but I &apos;m going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to go to the <unk> . We &apos;re going to film the real <unk> .
We &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> movie .
That &apos;s a big deal . It &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
And I <unk> them to fund an expedition .
Sounds crazy , but this goes back back to the imagination .
In fact , in fact , six months later , a reality , a reality , that I was able to put myself in a Russian <unk> , four kilometers away from the surface of the sea floor , and I was looking into the real Titanic from a <unk> .
This was not a movie , no high-definition reality , which was really .
So , this blew really completely up .
And it was a huge amount of preparation , and we had to build cameras and <unk> and all sorts of things .
And I noticed how this <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
Well , they were also <unk> and <unk> planning .
You go up into this capsule , you &apos;re going to go into this dark , <unk> environment down , where there &apos;s no hope of saving when you don &apos;t go back to it .
And I was thinking , &quot; Wow , this is exactly the same thing as I was in a <unk> .
That &apos;s really cool . &quot;
I was really obsessed with studying the deep ocean .
But anyway , by the part who &apos;s doing with curiosity and science , it was all . It was an adventure , it was curiosity . It was imagination .
And it was a experience that could not give me Hollywood .
Because , you know , I was able to imagine a creature that was able to design a visual effect , but I couldn &apos;t imagine what I would see outside of the <unk> .
In some of the following expeditions , I &apos;ve seen things like <unk> in <unk> , and sometimes things that I &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that have no time before , and when we saw them , they didn &apos;t even have words .
So that &apos;s what was <unk> , and I wanted to be more .
And that &apos;s how I made some unusual decision .
After the success of &quot; The Titanic &quot; I said , &quot; Okay , I want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker on ice and a time . &quot;
And then we started to plan these expeditions .
We came to <unk> , and <unk> it with <unk> .
We went back to the <unk> of the Titanic .
We took little robots that we had built a <unk> <unk> .
Our goal was to look back and look at the inner side of the <unk> that never be done before .
No one was exploring the interior of the <unk> . You have no means for that , so we developed the technology .
Now , I &apos;m sitting there on the deck of the Titanic , and I &apos;m sitting there on the floor of the Titanic , and I see <unk> that this kind of graph looks like this little and I know that once the band has played it .
And I was flying with a little helicopter flying through the corridors of the <unk> .
Actually , it &apos;s just the case , but my awareness is within the <unk> .
It felt like , as if I was physically alive , it was physically within the world .
This was the <unk> form of a <unk> that I &apos;ve ever experienced , because before I went around a corner , I always knew what was going to happen in the <unk> of the <unk> , because I was walking across the film .
The set was a specific copy of the <unk> of the <unk> .
So this was a very peculiar experience .
She made me realize this <unk> <unk> that you use such as <unk> <unk> and your consciousness in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
It was really profound profound .
And maybe a little bit of the way that might be able to happen , what might happen in a few decades , if you have to go to <unk> to explore something or other things , in all sorts of ways , that I can imagine as <unk> .
After this expedition , we started this thing that we &apos;ve seen at the bottom , for example , for example , for example , for example , like this <unk> , where we saw these amazing animals that we saw in the world , but this is like this .
They live with <unk> .
They don &apos;t exist in any way of affecting the system , how to do that .
And this is how you see animals right next to a 500 degrees centigrade .
<unk> live , and you can &apos;t imagine that they can survive there .
At the same time , I was also very interested in <unk> , which was the <unk> from my childhood .
And so I ended up with people who interest to space , and it &apos;s going to be able to go to <unk> and <unk> . You go to Russia , they go to Russia &apos;s protocol , they &apos;re going to go through the <unk> protocol and take it into the <unk> <unk> and take it into the <unk> .
That &apos;s fascinating .
But at the end of the end , it was going to take out that I was <unk> with the deep sea .
I took it to them with them , and I gave them access to the world : <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in these extreme extreme situations , and I took it to the source that they could take samples and use instruments and <unk> .
We turned to <unk> , but actually , in fact , science and engineering said , well .
So , along the line , the circle of my existence as a child , as a child , and the purpose of reality .
In the course of this <unk> , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science , but I learned a lot about <unk> .
Now you surely think there must be a director of a surgeon who is also a leader like a <unk> or so .
But I didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before I had these expeditions .
Because at some point , I had to say , &quot; What do I do here ?
Why do I do this ? What is this ? &quot;
These <unk> movies don &apos;t take us a cash .
We &apos;re just going to play the <unk> . That &apos;s not a clue .
Everybody thinks I was between &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and I would have had some on the <unk> on a towel .
I have all these movies , this <unk> , for a very small audience .
No glory , no credit , no money . What are you doing ?
You &apos;re doing it to the challenge to the challenge , and the ocean &apos;s the ocean , and the ocean &apos;s , you know , because you &apos;re doing it , and because of the weird connection that &apos;s going to create a group of people .
Because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working around for many years , and sometimes we have two to three months in the lake .
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is that it &apos;s the <unk> that you have , because there &apos;s one task which you cannot explain .
When you go back to country and say , &quot; We &apos;ve got to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the whole <unk> , the whole technology , and the problems , the human mind , if you go to see it , &quot; then , you can &apos;t explain the other people . &quot; That &apos;s like , like , that they can never explain it .
There &apos;s a connection , a <unk> respect .
So , when I came back to my film , I was able to turn the &quot; Avatar &quot; , I used to use the same <unk> , which is that your team respects respected and deserves their respect .
That &apos;s how the dynamic was changed .
So , I was back with a little team on <unk> terrain . We was called &quot; Avatar &quot; with a new technology that had no time .
<unk> exciting .
An enormous challenge .
And we were given a family of four and a half years .
That &apos;s how it changed to make movies , completely .
There were people who said , well , we could have these <unk> actually have good <unk> and <unk> on the planet .
For me , it was more like a <unk> way to do my job , which is the actual process that was changed .
So what is all that ?
What lessons have we learned ?
I think it &apos;s the first place that is curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful human trait .
Our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
And the <unk> of your team is more than the <unk> of the world .
To me , young filmmakers say , &quot; Please give me a advice like this . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t take you .
That &apos;s some other stuff for you . Don &apos;t you go to yourself , don &apos;t be willing to commit risks . &quot;
The NASA has a <unk> : &quot; Scheitern is not an alternative . &quot;
But in the arts and exploration , failure to be an alternative , because it will guarantee it a <unk> .
There was no big project that was demanding innovation , without the risks .
You have to be willing to take these risks .
That &apos;s the thought that I &apos;d like to give you the way I &apos;d like to tell you about the way that I &apos;d like to give you a choice , fear of fear . Thank you .
Now , if I want to give you a thing today , it &apos;s the whole of the data that we consume , bigger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about thinking about the sum of their parts of the world , I want you to think about how we can use information that &apos;s going to be able to use patterns , and we can see these trends that otherwise would not be visible .
So what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> that &apos;s organized .
The program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called <unk> , and what I can do with <unk> is that I can filter a certain death case , which is that we can tell crashes .
And immediately , I see a different pattern that &apos;s going to make it .
And it &apos;s because in the <unk> here , there are people in the <unk> here and they &apos;re over here .
We can go one step further , and then we can map the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not everybody .
Now , if we look at , if we go to the age of 40 , we &apos;re going to see 40 years old , we &apos;ll see that crashes as well as human beings should care .
And that &apos;s how <unk> is true , it &apos;s true among men .
So , you know , it &apos;s so that the reputation of information and data in this way is to think of a <unk> <unk> .
And if we can do this for raw data , why don &apos;t we also apply to content ?
Now , what we &apos;ve got here is that the <unk> of every single single person ever being printed .
It &apos;s all there . It &apos;s all online .
You can try to test it in my pocket .
<unk> can be immersed in a decade .
You can dive into a particular year .
You can go directly to a certain copy .
Now , when I look up here , I look at the athletes that appear in this edition and the sports .
I &apos;m a <unk> fan fan , so I <unk> this thing to show all the spending that <unk> Armstrong .
Now , if I want to take a <unk> look , I would like to think , &quot; OK , what if I look at all the time ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to take a step back and <unk> the point .
Now I see Greg <unk> .
And this is how you get a sense of this kind of information that &apos;s going to be based on this type of information , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and you don &apos;t just go to it .
You &apos;re doing something different .
It &apos;s something between , and we think it &apos;s going to be able to use the way information .
Now , I want to take this idea a little bit further along with something like a little bit crazy .
What we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single <unk> , and it &apos;s reduced to a little summary .
The summary contains a quick <unk> and a symbol for the domain of the matter .
Let me show you just the top 500 of the <unk> <unk> .
But even in this <unk> , we can do a lot of things .
Immediately , we get a sense about the issues that are about Wikipedia on Wikipedia .
So I &apos;m going to pick up the issue of government .
Now , after I first held , I know , the government of the government , I know , are the <unk> that are going to match Time for the year .
This is really important , because this is a realization that isn &apos;t going to be in a single box .
That &apos;s just to see when you go back and look at the whole thing .
<unk> on one particular summaries , I can go back to the theme of Time <unk> &quot; people of this year , &quot; and all of it together .
Now , if I look at all these people , I realize that the majority of it are <unk> . Some people come from science -- some , less , come from the economy . Here &apos;s my boss , and one comes out of the <unk> .
And interestingly , it &apos;s a TED Prize winner .
So now we can jump and look at the TED Prize winner .
You see , we can browse the net for the net as if it &apos;s actually a net , not just the way it &apos;s a net , but it &apos;s a lot of more abstract .
And so I want to show you what a little bit of a surprise could be .
Let me just show you just the New York Times &apos;s website .
<unk> , this application -- I don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s not a browser , but you can look at websites -- and we can take these <unk> to every single website like this .
So I can go back to a step back and just go to a specific <unk> .
That &apos;s why this is important , because it &apos;s just by watching websites in this way that can look at the same way .
So , I can zoom in on some time in a time frame .
Here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration that I was thinking about this .
And I can sort of everything that I &apos;ve ever seen before , <unk> .
And if I take a step back and look at it , I can look at my course , perhaps , I can maybe be able to go to my <unk> . Here I was looking for him to go for Bing , or look at the <unk> Labs .
And I can go into this page , and they can go back to it .
It &apos;s a metaphor that used to be used again , and every time it &apos;s the bigger picture , it &apos;s bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
Right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
We talk about the <unk> .
We talk from drowning in information .
What if we could turn this situation around and put the Internet on the head , so that instead of going to be able to go from one to many things to many things , many things could go to many things , and figure out patterns that otherwise would be hidden ?
If we can do this , this may become more possible , perhaps a new source of information , maybe a new source of information .
And , instead of just going to be able to go to information , we can get information .
And when we learn knowledge , maybe we can actually take a <unk> .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m listening to , thank you .
Each of us is talking about happiness .
I have some people who have spent the number of the books that were published in the title in the last five years , and they were spending about about 40 to 40 , and they were much more .
There &apos;s a massive wave of interest of interest in happiness among researchers .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
Everyone would like to make people happy .
But despite all of this tide of work , there &apos;s several cognitive <unk> that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
And my talk today is mainly related to this cognitive behavior .
That &apos;s true for <unk> that think about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true of scientists who think of happiness as well as everybody else .
The first of this <unk> is a <unk> to say to <unk> .
It turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
I think there &apos;s a certain sense that we could be able to limit it , but in large and large it &apos;s what we need to be able to stop , and we need to take the complicated view of what well-being is well-being .
The second thing is a <unk> of experience and memory : In fact , it &apos;s between happiness in its life and happiness of its life or with its life .
And these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the sense of happiness .
And the third one is the <unk> , and this is the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without its significance .
I mean , this is a genuine cognitive trap .
There &apos;s just no way to get there .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a <unk> that had a story written after one of my lectures that was a story . &#91; Unclear &#93; Now he said he had a <unk> , and it was perfectly beautiful music , and this was the end of the shot .
And then he added a rather emotional , which is the whole experience .
But this didn &apos;t have it .
What it was was that it was ruined the memories .
He had the experience .
There was 20 minutes of music .
She didn &apos;t go to it because he was with a memory of memory , the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything that was going to have it .
What this really tells us is that we could think about us and think about other people in the sense of two ways of self .
There is a <unk> self that lives in the present and present it in the presence of the past , but it &apos;s only the present .
It &apos;s the <unk> self , which is the doctor <unk> -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; Do it hurt ? &quot;
And then there is a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is this , and the history of our lives , and it &apos;s the history of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to <unk> the doctor by saying , &quot; How did you feel ? &quot;
Or , &quot; Who was your journey to <unk> ? &quot; , like that ?
These are two very different entities , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the two to the end of the <unk> of happiness of happiness .
Now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
And this starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts out immediately .
We don &apos;t just tell stories if we want to tell us stories .
Our memory tells us stories , which is what we have to be able to hold of our <unk> is a story .
And let &apos;s begin with an example .
There &apos;s an old study .
These are real patients who perform a painful procedure .
I &apos;m not going to go to any detail , but it &apos;s not painful , but she was painful when this trial was done in the 1990s .
They were asked every 60 seconds to report their pain .
And here are two patients . These are their records .
And you &apos;re asked , &quot; Who &apos;s more geleden ? &quot;
And this is a very simple question .
Patient B has no more geleden . His <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a chance of having patient B , and more .
But now , there is a different question : &quot; How was that thinking that they were suffering ? &quot;
And here &apos;s a surprise .
And the surprise is that patient A much worse <unk> than a much worse <unk> than a patient .
The stories of <unk> was different , and because it &apos;s a very critical part of history , how it ends .
And none of these stories are very sophisticated or excellent -- but one of them is this clear -- but one of them is much worse than the other .
And it &apos;s the much worse than the pain in the end was the pain in its peak . It &apos;s a terrible story .
How do we know ?
Because we &apos;ve asked these people to their <unk> , and even later , &quot; How bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
And she was much worse for A than B in the <unk> .
Now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
In terms of the <unk> self , that was clearly a poorer time .
Now what you could do with patient A , and we actually did , actually , clinical trials , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s going to work , you know , you could actually go to the <unk> of patient A &apos;s way without shaking the tube .
That &apos;s going to lead to the patient &apos;s suffering , but just a little less than before .
And if you have a few minutes long , you have to make sure that the <unk> self is a bad self , and you have to make sure that the <unk> self is a much better story because now you have a better story about your experience .
What is a story ?
And this is true for the stories that provides us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
In fact , a story of a story is <unk> , <unk> moments and ends .
<unk> are very , very important , and in this case , end .
Now , the <unk> self will live continuously .
It has moments of time , one after another .
And you wonder , what happens to these moments ?
And the answer is really easy . You know , you &apos;re lost forever .
I mean , most of the time of our lives -- and I did -- you know , you know , the psychological present present than about three seconds -- what it means is that in a life , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a life -- there are about 600,000 million there . In a month there are about 600,000 .
Most of them are completely ignored of the <unk> self .
And yet , you kind of give it to the sense that they should count what &apos;s going to happen during that moments of life .
It &apos;s the finite resource we use in this world .
And as we use it , it would be important to be important , but this is not the story that the <unk> self .
So we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really different .
The biggest difference between them is this time .
In terms of the <unk> self , if you have a holiday , it &apos;s the second week , like the first one , it &apos;s the first one , it &apos;s twice the time , like the <unk> vacation .
That &apos;s how this doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> self .
For the most part of the <unk> self , a <unk> vacation is hardly better than the <unk> holiday , because there are no new memories .
They haven &apos;t changed the story .
And in this way , this is the time , the critical variable that a <unk> self is different from a <unk> self , is a very little influence on this story .
Now , the <unk> self , more than to remember and tell stories .
It &apos;s actually the same thing , because if you have a patient , because if you have a patient that , say , there are two main surgeons in two different surgeons who choose to choose what he &apos;s supposed to choose , is that it &apos;s the memory that is less bad , and this is the surgeon who &apos;s selected .
The <unk> self has no voice in that choice .
In fact , we don &apos;t choose between <unk> . We choose between memories .
And even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future as our experience .
We think about our future as <unk> memories .
And essentially , you can look at this , you know , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self as one , as one , the <unk> self without the <unk> self .
I have the impression that , if we do that , if we &apos;re doing holiday , this is what &apos;s called <unk> <unk> on the <unk> self .
And this is a little hard to justify , I think .
I mean , how do we have the memories of our memories ?
This is one of the explanations that &apos;s the dominance of the <unk> self .
And when I think about this , I think on a vacation we &apos;ve done a few years ago on Antarctica , which was clearly the best holiday I had ever had , and I think it &apos;s a lot of times in terms of how often I think of other people .
And I &apos;ve probably described from my memories of my memories , I would say about 25 minutes tall in the last four years .
Now , if I would have you open up the folder , I &apos;d have spent an hour &apos;s time doing this .
That &apos;s three weeks , and this is a half a hour .
There seems like there seem to be a <unk> .
Now , I like a little bit of extremely , you know , you know , how little <unk> I have about the memory of your memories , but even if you give more of that , there &apos;s a real question . Why are we doing memory so much weight in the weight of the weight ?
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
Imagine your next vacation , you know , you know , at the end of the <unk> , all your pictures will be destroyed , and you get a <unk> drug , so you don &apos;t know .
Now , would you choose the same vacation ? And if you choose a other holiday , there is a conflict between your two ways of self , and you need to think of how you actually take this conflict , and that &apos;s not obvious , because if you think of your time , you might have an answer .
Why is we choosing the <unk> that we choose is a problem with a choice between the two types of self .
Now , the two forms of self , two terms of happiness , are two terms of happiness .
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , a self within a self .
So you can ask , how happy is this <unk> self ?
And then you would wonder , how happy are the moments of life in the life of the <unk> self ?
And they all are -- happiness for moments of time is a complicated process .
What are the emotions that are measured ?
And , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness of happiness as well as the time .
After the happiness of the <unk> self , it &apos;s a different thing .
That &apos;s not about how happy one person lives .
It &apos;s about how happy or excellent the person is thinking about their lives .
Very different term .
Each which doesn &apos;t make any sense of the terms of happiness , and I belong to a lot of scientists that are going to have a lot of scientists on well-being which have long known for the long term .
The distinction between the end of happiness of the <unk> self and the happiness of the <unk> self has been realized , and now you &apos;re trying to measure both of the <unk> .
The Gallup Organization has developed a worldwide survey , which is more than a half million people are questions about what they think about their lives and about their experience , and there were other efforts in the direction .
So in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of both kinds of self .
And the <unk> lesson we &apos;ve learned , I think , is that they &apos;re really different .
You can know how happy someone is with their lives , and this teaches them not much about how happy you live in life and vice versa .
Just to give you a sense of relation to relation to relation to connection .
What it means is that if you would meet someone and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?
Now , you know , you might know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
They have so much uncertainty .
If I tell you that someone &apos;s life is like eight based on a scale of 10 years , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with its <unk> self .
So that correlation is low .
We know a little bit about what it does .
We know that money is very important , goals are very important .
We know that happiness mainly means being satisfied with people we like to spend time with people that we like .
There &apos;s other pleasure , but it &apos;s dominant .
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the self of the self , you &apos;re going to do very different things .
The conclusion from what I &apos;ve said here is that we &apos;re actually not supposed to be able to really imagine if we &apos;re a <unk> for well-being .
It &apos;s a completely different term .
Now , a very quick thing , a different reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness , is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
So , if you ask the simple question , how happy people are you in California , you don &apos;t get the right answer .
If you think about this question , if you think the people in California have to be happier when you say , in Ohio , we live in Ohio .
And what happens is that when you think about life in California , you think of the difference between California and other places , and this difference , say , in the climate .
Well , it turns out the climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
But it &apos;s because the <unk> self is responsible , you can end up at California .
And it &apos;s interesting to track what happens with people that go to California in the hope to become happier .
Now , your <unk> self will not become happier .
We know this .
But one thing is going to happen . You &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier , because when they &apos;re thinking about it , they &apos;re going to be reminded of how terrible the weather is in Ohio , and they feel that they made the right decision .
It &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and I hope I have some sense of how difficult it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you .
Now , when we first mentioned a few weeks ago , you &apos;ve mentioned that it was a pretty interesting conclusion that came from this Gallup survey .
Is this something that you can get to participate , because you have a few minutes left ?
Daniel <unk> : Sure .
I think the most interesting thing that we &apos;ve found in the Gallup survey is a number that we &apos;ve never expected to find .
We found this in terms of the <unk> self .
If we look at ourselves , we vary like emotions to income .
And it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans , it &apos;s a very large sample of Americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a large representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year of income --
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in a year is people are unhappy , and they become increasingly <unk> , you &apos;re poorer .
That &apos;s what we get on a completely flat line .
I mean , I &apos;ve never seen so much flat lines .
What happens is , it &apos;s obvious that money is a <unk> <unk> , but that lack of money a lot of money to have a <unk> <unk> , and we can measure this very clearly very , very clear .
In the sense of the other self , of the <unk> self , you get a different story .
The more money you deserve are more money .
That &apos;s not true for emotions .
CA : But Danny , in the whole country , is about life to life , freedom to seek happiness .
If people take this seriously seriously seriously , I mean , it all looks like this , everything we think , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
Is there a chance that there is a chance that the country would take the country generally a <unk> like the seriousness of the seriousness , and it would make sense of politics ?
DK : You know , I think there &apos;s tribute to the role of the <unk> in politics .
The recognition is going to be slow down to the United States , not a question , but in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s going to happen in other countries .
People are realizing that they should think of happiness when they think of politics .
It &apos;s going to take a while , and people will argue whether they want to study whether they want to study whether they want to go to study , so we have to go to this discussion fairly soon .
As you can measure happiness , it can be very different depending on how you might think of the <unk> self , whether you think of the <unk> self .
That &apos;s going to affect politics , I think , in the coming years .
In the United States , you have to measure the <unk> of the population .
That &apos;s , I think , in the next one or two decades , be part of the national statistics .
CA : Well , it seems to me , this subject gets to , or at least , should be the most interesting political debate in the future .
Thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
Thank you , Danny <unk> .
Today I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
And this may be surprising , perhaps , because my <unk> at the foundation , it &apos;s just about vaccines and seeds to produce the things that we invent , and to deliver the poorest two billion to a better life .
But energy and climate are extremely important for those people , even more than any other species on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow in many years . We too much or less . The things are going to be changing how it can &apos;t withstand their fragile environment .
This leads to <unk> . It leads to <unk> .
So , it will become a climate crisis for them .
It &apos;s also the <unk> for them .
In fact , if you could reduce one of the price of the price to reduce the price of the most effective energy .
Now , the <unk> is about the time .
In fact , it &apos;s based on <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> was the Industrial Revolution , and in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in <unk> , and so we have refrigerators , <unk> , and so many things .
So we are in a wonderful situation in a wonderful situation in the rich world .
But if we reduce the price of reducing -- let &apos;s cut the price down -- we &apos;re going to have a new barrier and this barrier is combined with CO2 .
CO2 heats the planets , and the equation for CO2 is actually quite clear .
They <unk> the CO2 CO2 , which leads to the <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative effects -- effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the natural ecosystems that can &apos;t adapt to the natural ecosystems that can &apos;t adapt to the natural ecosystems .
Now , the exact same connection between the kind of <unk> and the <unk> and where their other effects are , there &apos;s some <unk> , but not quite a lot .
And there &apos;s no doubt about how bad these implications are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
I have asked the question of several times : &quot; Do we really go to the end of the world ?
Don &apos;t they have half the size or a quarter ? &quot;
The answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature goes up .
So it &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s very different than to say , we have a three feet tall that you have to have to go under a three meters , which is that you have to put it down . That &apos;s how you put it down .
This is going to go down to zero .
Now , every year , every year every year , every year , every year , every year , it &apos;s going to <unk> 26 billion tons .
Every one of the Americans is about 20 tons ; people from poor countries , less than one .
On average , it &apos;s about five tons of every planet .
And somehow , we have to create changes that can reduce this in zero .
It &apos;s now increased .
In fact , there &apos;s only different economic changes in it , and we have to go to <unk> growth , and we &apos;ve got to go to a reduction in zero .
This equation has four factors ; a little bit of <unk> . You have this thing on the left -- CO2 -- that &apos;s going to depend on the number of the people that each person on average the average energy , the average energy for every human and the CO2 that it &apos;s going to use every person on average the average energy for every service and CO2 that is going to be a <unk> .
So , let &apos;s look at every factor of one , and we think how we get this at zero .
In fact , one of those figures are very close to zero .
Now this is primary algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
First , we have the population .
Today <unk> billion people live .
And it turns out that it &apos;s nine billion <unk> to move on to nine billion .
In fact , if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , we could be able to reduce <unk> and <unk> that are 10 percent to 15 percent , but we can see a slope about 1.3 .
The second factor is the services we use .
That includes all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
These are very good things , and what it means is that these services are accessible to almost everyone on the planet .
It &apos;s great that this number goes up .
In the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to use <unk> and less use , but it &apos;s less likely , but it &apos;s going to be more than doubling every year , the number of services that are being provided by the number of services that are going to be provided by .
Here we see a very basic service here . Are there a lot of light that can read the homework ?
And those students didn &apos;t have it , so they go and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
Now , in terms of efficiency , the energy , the power of service , is there &apos;s good news .
We have something that &apos;s not going up .
Because of different successes , because of different successes in the <unk> process , there &apos;s a lot of work that &apos;s going to be able to be able to dramatically reduce , can be reduced to the cost of getting to be able to be able to be able to go to , <unk> , <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Some individual services can reduce 90 percent .
In other parts of the world , as the result , at 105 a.m . , <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , is the <unk> of improvement in progress .
In total , if we are optimistic , maybe we can be less likely to be able to use a factor of three or maybe a factor 6 , maybe a factor of six .
But with the first three factors , we have gone from 26 billion to maybe 13 billion tons of oil , and that &apos;s just not enough !
So let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this will be a <unk> -- this is the amount of CO2 that is going to be a <unk> .
It turns out the question is if you can get it at the zero .
If you burn Coal : No .
If you burn natural gas , no .
That &apos;s almost every current source of energy consumption of electricity today , except for renewable energy production .
So what we need on a global level is to create a new system .
We need <unk> .
Now , when I use the term &quot; <unk> &quot; , I don &apos;t mean the impossible .
The <unk> is a miracle . The PC is a miracle .
The Internet and its services is a miracle .
These people have contributed to the evolution of the <unk> .
Normally , there &apos;s no <unk> that you need to have a miracle until a typical date .
Normally , you &apos;re just wrong , and some of you don &apos;t get it .
But in this case , we have to put <unk> and a miracle in very short time .
Now , I was wondering , how can I really actually <unk> that ?
Is it a natural <unk> , a demonstration to this idea of the idea of people here ?
I remembered last year , when I was going to mosquitos , it allowed people to do that .
The idea was that it was really tangible , you know , that there are people who live with mosquitos .
So for energy , this was this one .
I decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be able to be my <unk> contribution to the environment .
So here &apos;s some natural fireflies .
They told me that they don &apos;t bite . In fact , they don &apos;t even leave the glass .
Well , there &apos;s all kinds of <unk> like this , but they all don &apos;t get much .
We need solutions , or one or many which have a tremendous amount of scaling and incredible <unk> , and although there &apos;s lots of different ways that humans might be able to see these large requirements .
I have <unk> , <unk> , fusion and <unk> .
This might be able to do a <unk> and if they do better than I expect , it &apos;s great , but my <unk> here is that we have all the five needs , and we can &apos;t be able to give them up because it &apos;s all <unk> problems .
Let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning coal from coal or natural gas .
What you need to do , it may seem just like this , but it &apos;s not . You have to all have the CO2 that comes out of the burning of the burning of the <unk> , capture under pressure , and then it stays somewhere there .
There are some <unk> that it &apos;s going to be 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be going to be very difficult for 100 percent . And it &apos;s going to make a difference for the CO2 of the CO2 of the CO2 of the CO2 of the CO2 of the CO2 .
Who will make it ?
Who can guarantee something that literally a billion times bigger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
That &apos;s a lot of volume .
So this is a big deal .
The next : <unk> .
It &apos;s also three big problems , and the cost , especially in <unk> countries , are high . The question is that you really feel that nothing could go wrong , despite the human cooperation that the fuel doesn &apos;t use weapons .
What do you do with the garbage ?
Because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
People have to feel good at this point : 10 : 20.000 -- 10 : 20.000 -- 10 : 25,000 of these are three very difficult problems that may be solvable .
So three very difficult problems that may be solvable , and that &apos;s why you should work .
The last three of the five I &apos;ve summarized .
These are the most sophisticated energies as they &apos;re often called .
And even though they have -- even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
One is the <unk> that these technologies are dramatically reduced as to <unk> .
These are <unk> , you know , you &apos;ve heard of many <unk> , every time a typical power station .
In addition to these sources , these kinds of <unk> have <unk> .
The sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem to every day , it doesn &apos;t seem to every day and so on .
That &apos;s why , if you depend on this source , you have to have a way to have the energy that you &apos;re not available at once .
So there are big <unk> there . There are challenges of transmission : if we say that the source of energy is outside of the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you don &apos;t need to just take the technology that &apos;s different from where it comes differently .
And there is a <unk> .
And in order to show the dimension , I have all the kinds of batteries that are made , which are the cars , computers , mobile phone , <unk> , for all , and that &apos;s what I was doing with the amount of electronic energy that used to store the world , compared to the world , less than 10 minutes of the <unk> .
So we need a big breakthrough , something that is going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches approaches .
That &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
This is what happens when you try to take these different sources of information to say 20 percent -- 30 percent of the <unk> .
If you want to support 100 percent , you need an incredible <unk> .
Now , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
A &apos; <unk> Project ? How come we ?
What we need is a lot of companies that work . Hundreds .
In every five areas , we need at least 100 people .
In many words , you &apos;ll say , you know , you &apos;re nuts ! That &apos;s good .
I think there &apos;s this in the TED group there are many who already engaged there .
Bill <unk> has developed several companies among other companies , among other things called the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is investing in dozens of companies doing great stuff and some interesting ways and I try to support this .
Nathan Myhrvold , and I &apos;m funded a company that might have been able to follow the nuclear approach .
There are some innovations in <unk> ; modular , liquid .
The development has stopped in this industry recently , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts <unk> .
The <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> that &apos;s one percent that &apos;s going to burn , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
That &apos;s a kind of crazy idea .
But actually , you &apos;ve had been thinking about this , but you &apos;ve never been able to simulate whether it was going to work , but since then , there &apos;s modern supercomputer model , you can simulate it , and see it , that it &apos;s <unk> .
And because you burn those 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
In fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors .
Instead of breaking over your head , you just burn it . It &apos;s a great thing .
That uranium is <unk> , a little bit like a candle .
You see , it &apos;s a kind of a column when it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
That solves the <unk> .
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky .
That &apos;s the waste , which is the 99 percent . You &apos;ve got this part which is <unk> , <unk> uranium .
The U.S. government for hundreds of years .
And if you go to <unk> and <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the life of the planet .
You know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s one example of many hundreds of thousands of concepts that we need to go to forward .
Let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
What should our evidence look like ?
Now , we go to the goal that we need to reach and then talk about the <unk> .
Many are spoken by 80 percent by 2050 .
It &apos;s really very important that we get there .
The remaining 20 percent are going to be produced in the poor countries , and we &apos;ll have some agriculture . Hopefully it &apos;s going to be <unk> and cement until that &apos;s going to be clean .
So in order to reach these 80 percent , the developed world needs to be developed , including countries like China , their <unk> completely .
The other note tells us whether we use technology technology , whether it &apos;s in all the developed world , and we &apos;re on the way that they get to the rest .
That &apos;s great .
This is going to become a <unk> .
If we go back from there , what should data should look up in 2020 ?
It should be the same elements .
We should use the <unk> to get to reduce reduction , less we <unk> , the less we will be the <unk> and the temperature .
But in fact , this note is this note to the things that we &apos;re doing , which is not going to lead to the large environmental movement , but it &apos;s just a bit less important like the speed of innovation to these breakthroughs .
These breakthroughs to be able to follow with <unk> , and we can measure : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
There &apos;s lots of big books about this theme .
The Al Gore &apos;s book , &quot; We have a choice , &quot; and David <unk> &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the hotdog . &quot;
They go through it , and they can create a framework that can be widely shared , because we need to support it all the side of the pages .
There &apos;s some things that have to come together .
That &apos;s a wish .
A very <unk> wish that we invent this technology .
If you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , I could pick up the president , a vaccine , and I love this wish , or I could choose this wish , which is <unk> <unk> without CO2 , this wish will take away from the wish .
That &apos;s the biggest impact .
If we don &apos;t get this wish will be the wish of the <unk> between the long-term ones and the short-term people that are going to be terrible , between the United States and China , between the poor and the rich and almost every life of those two billion .
So what do we need ?
What do I have to do ?
We need to use more <unk> .
If countries are going to meet in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about CO2 .
You should talk to these <unk> , and you would be shocked by the <unk> of the <unk> that are going to spend these innovative approaches .
We need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> &apos;s food , a <unk> thing .
We have to spread the message .
We need to lead dialogue and <unk> and also the things that have been done by the government .
It &apos;s an important wish , but I think we can do it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you all very much . Just to understand a little bit better -- <unk> , can give us a sense of scale of that investment ?
Bill Gates : You know , Bill Gates : You know , what &apos;s going to do on a supercomputer and all the big scientists , and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a Russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , it &apos;s only going to work in the <unk> million .
The difficult step is to build the first <unk> to find additional billions and billions of which actually build the <unk> and the location of the first building .
And once the first thing is done when he &apos;s going to win like this , it &apos;s all clear , because it &apos;s all clear , because the <unk> , the <unk> , is different as we know it .
CA : So , in order to understand this , this is going to be deep , almost in the bottom of the ground , almost like a vertical pillar of nuclear energy processing , this is the way that starts going up and starts down to the bottom ?
BG : Exactly . Today , you &apos;ve got to have the reactor <unk> , so there &apos;s lots of people and lots of people who can go wrong , so this thing where you open it and stuff or <unk> it . That &apos;s not good !
But if you have a very cheap fuel , you can put it back for 60 years -- think about a column -- you know , without the whole <unk> .
And it &apos;s sitting there and burns 60 years and it &apos;s done .
CA : A <unk> that &apos;s offering a solution to the garbage .
BG : Yes . Now what &apos;s going on with the garbage : You can sit it down -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this way -- you take it and put it into the next reactor and burn it .
And we &apos;re beginning to take the waste that already exists , which exists in this <unk> or <unk> . That &apos;s our <unk> .
So it &apos;s what &apos;s a problem that was a problem , which we live in our lives , and that &apos;s going to dramatically reduce the speed of this process .
CA : But as you &apos;ve spoken with different people in the world , they &apos;ve spoken about those opportunities .
What is the most important thing to do ?
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t yet set up a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> for all the called &quot; <unk> &quot; in Russia , so there &apos;s huge interest in Russia , India , China , China , China , China , China , China , and how this fits to <unk> .
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and the Japanese have made a difference .
This is a kind of variation that was done .
That &apos;s a big step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster bit , and some countries have this built , so that it &apos;s one that has a rapid reactor to our first .
CA : So , in your mind , what time was time , what &apos;s going on ?
BG : So now we need one of those <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years for inventing and 20 years .
That &apos;s sort of the <unk> that shows us the <unk> that we need to <unk> .
And , you know , you know , <unk> if everything &apos;s good , and this is a big wish , could it be easy .
And fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds and hundreds of them who , as their approach to work , can work for the pilots that work .
And it would be best if it could make a difference , because then you could use a mixture .
Anyway , we need a solution .
CA : <unk> the big possible breakthroughs , this is the best thing you know ?
BG : A <unk> is the <unk> .
That &apos;s without the <unk> , but it &apos;s going to make it so much more important .
In the nuclear sector , there are other cutting-edge companies .
You know , we don &apos;t know how this works like this , but it &apos;s the modular way , but it &apos;s the modular way that it &apos;s a different approach .
There &apos;s a liquid <unk> that looks a little hard , but maybe it &apos;s going to tell us .
And so there are different , but this beautiful thing is that a million times a million times so much energy , like one , a <unk> , and therefore , if you manage to deal with the problem , the footprint and the cost of the cost , the impact on the country and other things , the impact on the ground and other things , almost in a <unk> .
CA : If it doesn &apos;t work , what is it ?
Do we need to <unk> <unk> to try to keep operating ?
BG : If you come to this situation , it &apos;s like having too much food and a little bit of a heart attack . What do you take ? You might need a <unk> or so .
There &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> that &apos;s called <unk> that deals with various techniques to heat the warming in order for 20 to 30 years .
That &apos;s just a <unk> .
You hope that we don &apos;t need that .
Some people say , you know , you should not be able to work at the insurance , because maybe you want to eat , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , because you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
I don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a conversation about how to have this problem , whether it &apos;s going to be going to be able to go faster , or this innovation is longer than we expect .
CA : <unk> : Do you have one or two sentences to try to convince you ?
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics are living in very different camps .
Those who make scientific arguments are very little .
Tell them that there &apos;s a negative impact that having to do with clouds that are shifting ?
There are very , very few things they can tell you that there is a chance in one million .
The <unk> here is as like AIDS .
You make the mistakes now , and you pay a lot of it later .
And that &apos;s why this idea , now , if you have all sorts of <unk> problems to invest in something that you have -- and that &apos;s why the investment is not so clear . In fact , the IPCC are not necessarily the worst , and there are people in the rich world that tell the IPCC that the IPCC are going to tell the IPCC .
The fact is that this uncertainty should worry about us .
But my dream here is that , if you can do economically , it &apos;s going to be able to remove the <unk> : &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not interested in it because I don &apos;t really care , because it &apos;s cheaper , but I &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous way . &quot;
CA : And that would be your answer to the <unk> argument that if you use all of this time and energy to solve the CO2 problem , all those other targets suffer from malaria , and that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources available to malaria and so on , it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources that we can do .
BG : Well , the actual cost for the research is that we should have spent the U.S. spending 10 billion dollars a year than they &apos;re doing today -- this is not so dramatic .
That &apos;s not supposed to be other things .
You come up to big <unk> , and you can &apos;t agree that it &apos;s going to be an economic rule when you have something that is not economically economically , and it &apos;s the most of the waste .
It &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very quick before a <unk> and funded the <unk> . I think we should try to make more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
If the <unk> that you get , it &apos;s a very high <unk> , you can just keep the rich ones .
I mean , every one of us here could spend five times in our energy without changing our lifestyle .
But for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
And even <unk> thinking .
His new <unk> is now , &quot; Why is the research not going to be discussed ? &quot;
It &apos;s still , because of his former stories , with the <unk> associated , but it &apos;s understood that this is a very lonely group , and so it &apos;s going to take the <unk> .
And this is a <unk> that I think is for appropriate .
The research , it &apos;s just nuts how little it &apos;s going to support .
CA : Bill , I think I &apos;m talking about almost all the people here , when I tell you , I &apos;m really sure that your wish becomes true . Thank you .
BG : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about a few months ago in writing about an article for Italian Wired .
I used to write my <unk> <unk> , but I was ready with the <unk> of the <unk> , and I noticed that I &apos;ve never been in my life in my life , what is the word &quot; disabled &quot; .
Let me tell you the entry .
&quot; <unk> . &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , powerful , <unk> . &quot;
I have this list out of a friend loud , and I had to laugh like this , so that it was so silly , but I just came up with &quot; <unk> &quot; and I had no more <unk> , and I had to stop thinking about this <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Now , of course , this was a <unk> old <unk> . I just thought that the output must be pretty old .
But in fact , it was a story on the early &apos; 80s when I first started with elementary school buildings , and it began to create my <unk> building outside of my <unk> building , and also in terms of other kids and to the rest of the world around me .
And thank God , I was using no <unk> .
If I take this chart seriously seriously , I was born into a world that would perceive someone like me as a person who lives in a meaningful way , but now I &apos;m going to share with the opportunities and the adventure that I &apos;ve experienced .
So I immediately asked myself to go to the <unk> of 2009 , and I was expected to find a <unk> .
Here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
<unk> is not much better .
In particular , the last two words are the &quot; Middle East <unk> &quot; and healthy .
But it &apos;s not just about the words .
It &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
It &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how to build these values ?
Our language influences our way to our thinking and how to see the world and humans around us .
Many <unk> societies , including the Greeks and the <unk> , they really believed that the <unk> of a <unk> has a big force , because what you can say is that it can be <unk> .
So what do we want to do -- what do we want -- a <unk> human beings ?
In fact , it &apos;s already able to say a human being as a child , could be enough , they could be able to limit them and <unk> them .
Wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open ?
A human being who was open for me , was my pediatrician was in the <unk> . <unk> Institute in <unk> .
He &apos;s called Dr. <unk> . A <unk> whose name you can think of , as you can tell the majority of Americans could not be able to stand correctly .
And Dr. P.
I found that time that I spent in this hospital , I was just fine -- until my <unk> .
I had to repeat some of the exercises that seem infinite , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- in different colors -- this is what you know to build my <unk> , and I hated it . I hated it .
And , imagine , I even have a <unk> child with Dr. P. and so on , this means that those practices , without success .
And one day he looked at me at one of my exercises -- those exercises were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re a powerful , <unk> and a young girl , you will <unk> one day .
And when you put it back , I &apos;ll give you 100 bucks . &quot;
This was just a simple trick by Dr. P. I &apos;m doing the exercises that I didn &apos;t want to make , with the prospect of becoming a <unk> <unk> girl in the second floor , but he was actually able to see my daily <unk> <unk> with new eyes . This was a new and <unk> experience .
And I &apos;m wondering , as a result , how much his vision of me had shaped like a powerful and <unk> young girl , and I could imagine being able to see me as one of the nature of nature of powerful people .
This is just one example of how adults can be able to encourage the imagination to be able to encourage imagination .
But as you know , how to see some <unk> examples of the evidence , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine what we would all wish we would all wish to see , it would give us all the individuals to see themselves like <unk> people .
Our language <unk> the social changes that are going to be triggered by a technological transformation .
From the medical point of view , you can say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of Titan and artificial <unk> &apos;s body , to really use all of the ways to use it to use , actually , to use all of the ways to use it to have its own identity .
And it &apos;s going to orient to groups around the world that they choose .
So maybe it &apos;s going to take this technological transformation , because you know , there &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every human being could have done a lot of the world and can be very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to it , is our greatest gain .
The human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how to go with <unk> <unk> and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about the questions of people to answer the questions of people , and I think that &apos;s why .
This is a sentence of how to live the idea of <unk> from the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge without being able to get through the experience without being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take a <unk> with a prosthetic limb , or , as well as humans with my body .
But the truth is that we change us , of course , of course , we are the challenge of our challenge , whether it &apos;s physical or emotional or even both of them .
And I &apos;m saying that this is good .
<unk> are not a obstacle that we need to get to <unk> to our lives better .
<unk> are just to our lives .
And I tend to look like <unk> as my shadow .
Sometimes I realize that it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s not too easy , but it &apos;s all of me .
And I don &apos;t want to go to the impact of the impact , or the severity of the <unk> of a human being .
There are <unk> and challenges , and it &apos;s just <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> , and every person is different , but the question isn &apos;t whether we &apos;re going to get it out there .
So , we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to go to <unk> , but it &apos;s also to prepare it so well .
And we don &apos;t make our kids a favor when we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
You have to clear two things : to be able to be able to be a health issue , and to the other social concern about whether I &apos;m disabled or not .
And to be honest , the only one and a permanent disability , with which I had to tell myself , is that the world always does , they can describe me with these definitions .
In our wish to protect people who lie to us at the heart of the heart and the hard to tell them the hard truth to communicate , or even a prediction for quality of life , that it &apos;s supposed to be , we have to pay attention to the fact that we don &apos;t actually have a foundation .
Perhaps this is the concept of the concept that just <unk> what &apos;s going on in a broken way , and how to fix this , for any greater disability than the <unk> .
If we don &apos;t treat a people like a human being , and not all of its forces and sense of and recognizing , we can create in addition to the natural struggle that they may have to lead to another disease .
We <unk> a human being based on our society .
So , we have to look beyond the <unk> and to focus on all the human possibilities .
But in the <unk> , it &apos;s that between our <unk> and our brilliance , there &apos;s a connection .
We should not be able to <unk> the <unk> times or <unk> , we should not be able to go to it , but it &apos;s about to go to the <unk> of the carpet , but it &apos;s about to see it in the <unk> of the <unk> .
It may be about me to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome <unk> , but it &apos;s open to it to embrace it , to embrace it , to take it to <unk> , to actually take a <unk> and maybe even use it .
And perhaps , we can make it , <unk> as a natural way of seeing , <unk> and useful , and so through our presence of their presence .
In this year , we celebrate the 200 . Geburtstag of Charles Darwin , and when he wrote 150 years ago over evolution , Darwin , in my eyes , it pointed out that it &apos;s true in human nature .
I would like to put it into this : not the most powerful of its way of surviving , and also not the <unk> of its way , but who can adapt to the changes of the changes .
And it comes out of conflicts .
Not just from Darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of human beings to survive and <unk> , of course , of the human mind of the human mind .
So , again , change , change and customization , are the greatest skills of humans .
And maybe we know exactly what wood is that we &apos;re <unk> when we &apos;re really tested .
Maybe it &apos;s the sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of awareness , a sense of our own power .
We can give ourselves something like that .
We can give a sense of a new sense of what &apos;s going to go beyond the difficult time .
Maybe we can see <unk> as a change .
<unk> represent a change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted .
I think the biggest harm we have is to think of ourselves , is that we have to be normal .
Let &apos;s face -- who is normal ?
There is no ordinary .
There &apos;s this <unk> . The <unk> . But it &apos;s not the regular , and you would really know this poor , gray person to really know if it really exists ?
I don &apos;t think .
It would be great if we think this paradigm of normal to another of the possibilities of the power of the matter , to be able to formulate a little bit of dangerous to be able to put it into a lot of very many children , and it &apos;s able to introduce the forces of a lot of very much to bring to society in the society .
<unk> discovered that we &apos;ve always had people of the members of our society ever needed to be a <unk> and a contribution .
There is evidence that the Neanderthals have been around 60,000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical injuries , and that might happen , because the <unk> in the <unk> of the human society was valuable .
They have no sense of these people and useless ; they were like something like that and <unk> .
A few years ago , I went into the city where I grew up in a <unk> in this &#91; Red Zone &#93; &#91; Red Zone &#93; &#91; Red Zone &#93; , and I was standing there on a <unk> tomatoes .
It was summer , and I had <unk> .
And I listen to how one guy tells me , &quot; After this is not Aimee <unk> . &quot;
And I <unk> around and seeing this older man . I had no idea who it is .
And I was like , &quot; Excuse me , sir , we know ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , you know , you don &apos;t remember me .
When I first looked at it , I was pulled out of your mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
Oh , so .
And , of course , it &apos;s going to click .
This was Dr. <unk> , a man that I only knew from my mother about this day , because of course , I was very typical with my birthday in two weeks .
The doctor for my mother &apos;s medical diagnosis was on vacation , and my parents knew the guy who was me in the world .
And because I was born without <unk> , and my feet would have been to that and I had just a few toes on this and a bunch of toes in the other foot he had to have the bad news .
He said to me , &quot; Well , I had to tell your parents that you &apos;d never run , and never be going to be <unk> like other kids or that you could never live without independent life , and ever since then . &quot;
But what &apos;s extraordinary was that he had been collecting my whole childhood , whether I was going to win at a <unk> in the second grade , whether I was <unk> with the Halloween party , whether I had my scholarship or one of my graduate students , and he used these clips to teach his students , <unk> from the <unk> Medical School .
And he called this part of his <unk> the X factor , the potential of the human spirit .
You can &apos;t just point enough how to be able to be the quality of life for the quality of life .
And Dr. <unk> said , he said , &quot; I &apos;ve learned that kids when they don &apos;t always say something else , and even if it gets a little different , if you don &apos;t say kids , well , kids can really get a lot of work . &quot;
Look , Dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
He had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone deals with two different things .
And I also changed my thinking about the time when they asked me at age 15 , if they asked me about the age of 15 ago , if I had my prostheses of flesh and bone <unk> , I wouldn &apos;t have a second <unk> .
I was going to just go normal a normal way .
If you ask me this question , I &apos;m not sure that .
And this is what this is happening , <unk> I &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and I don &apos;t experience these experiences .
And perhaps this transformation could happen , because I &apos;m having so many people who have been able to have the doors to have me open , instead of people to see me , or to give me a sense of <unk> .
You see , it really needs just a people who can show you how you can <unk> your forces , and you &apos;re through .
If you allow someone to touch your own , your own , your inner powers -- the human mind -- if you can do this , and you can open it up for someone to open up a door , then you &apos;re good at these people .
They get them to open doors .
The meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
It means to produce something that &apos;s in one , the potential of <unk> .
Again , which is what we want to do ?
In the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s was done a <unk> , there was a <unk> in <unk> .
They call it &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in America called <unk> .
The students are going to split grades .
And the A students are getting paid harder time records , getting better teachers .
They &apos;ve given over a hundred thousand students to have a &quot; <unk> &quot; with a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- they were told they were very clever , they were very clever , and after those three months they were writing .
And of course , it &apos;s <unk> to listen to the heart of the way that the <unk> was being said that they were just enough .
And that &apos;s the same for the three months .
But only those who were still in school -- except for students who have had the school .
That &apos;s very critical at this trial that was that the teachers didn &apos;t have to be <unk> .
The teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
You &apos;ve just been told that were the <unk> and that are the students have enough . And they &apos;ve taught them what they &apos;ve taught them and treated them .
The only real disability is a spiritual mind , a ghost , no longer exists . He doesn &apos;t find any more of our natural , <unk> <unk> and our innate ability of imagination of imagination .
But if we do it , if we manage to create the human spirit , continue to hope , it &apos;s going to be able to find out , curiosity , curiosity , <unk> , and then our powers really are positive .
If a mind has a mind about those qualities , we can create a new reality , and we can create a new reality .
I want to end with a poem that was written by a poet poet named <unk> in the 14th century , and my friend Jacques <unk> has told my friend Jacques <unk> , and the poem is called &quot; The God only four words , not the god of the name , not the God of the name , but the God only once four words knows . &quot;
<unk> with me . Thank you .
