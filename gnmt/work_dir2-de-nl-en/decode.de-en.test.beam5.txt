For a few years ago , here with TED , Peter <unk> called a <unk> called <unk> .
And the concept is quite easy . It &apos;s really hard for those <unk> <unk> with 20 <unk> , and there are <unk> tape , and a marshmallow building .
And the marshmallow should look down .
And , as though it &apos;s really hard , it &apos;s really hard , because it &apos;s really hard , because it &apos;s really hard .
And so I thought this is an interesting concept , and I &apos;ve got it into a <unk> .
It was a huge job .
And since I was at the same time , I &apos;ve done at a 70 of the world , with students , <unk> and architect , and there &apos;s something like that , in fact , even though it &apos;s a little bit more sophisticated in those nature , and I &apos;d like to have some of them with you .
Well , as they start , you start asking the most people in the future .
And you have the reason , which is thinking about how it looks like , in order for power .
And then you have a little bit of a little bit more time , and as a result . You have <unk> and <unk> .
You &apos;re going to put a lot of the time in the middle of these days in the world , in the same way .
And then , finally , before they have no time , they get the marshmallow , and they &apos;re going to put it on top of the top , a step back to the top of the top .
And then , as soon as it is , it &apos;s going to be a &quot; <unk> &quot; by a &quot; <unk> &quot; , because of the way it &apos;s the way that it makes all the time , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
There are a bunch of people , or they have a lot of &quot; <unk> &quot; as other people , and if you have <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re lying , they are <unk> , they are <unk> , and they can really create <unk> .
And there &apos;s always a team that has a lot of &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> and under the best time , and if you have <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s pretty amazing .
For Peter <unk> , they only do not just the highest <unk> , but the idea of all the <unk> .
So what might they ask , and why ?
And Peter says , &quot; <unk> of the kind of kind of kind of <unk> in the middle of the <unk> . &quot;
You don &apos;t have a time in <unk> .
Well , there &apos;s another thing about that .
And this is how <unk> <unk> , which is a really easy plan .
And then the way to do that .
So , what happens when they got the marshmallow at the top of the top , they have no time , and was done ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
<unk> you know ?
So what <unk> is different , they build up with the marshmallow , and they build a prototype , and they have a little bit more <unk> to the top of the top , so that they have more <unk> prototypes .
Now , the way you see is this kind of role as the essence of a <unk> .
And then , in fact , if they took a little bit of the kind of kind of <unk> , it &apos;s not .
So that is the prestatie , in the prototype , a big -- but we &apos;ve got a look at different teams .
It &apos;s the equivalent of that at the same time when it comes to <unk> , which is a little bit of the time , as you know , and not a lot of it , but it &apos;s not a lot of the adult .
Wie is the <unk> ?
Now , architect and nurses , too .
<unk> is that <unk> , I saw .
And why ? Because they have <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> patronen to build <unk> .
<unk> lie a little bit about . But here &apos;s interesting .
<unk> man a <unk> <unk> in the team , they get better .
It &apos;s really hard . You can see , and recognize this team . &quot;
You can say that . Why ?
Because they have a kind of idea of <unk> .
You &apos;ve got the way of making it .
And this team , and the way it does , and how does this job change , which is the job quality of teams .
<unk> Fähigkeiten and <unk> , and they have to change the green .
If you have 10 teams , which typical , you &apos;ve got a look at six , which you have .
So I took a little bit more <unk> .
And I thought , well , let &apos;s look at it .
And so , I took a $ a $ <unk> $ .
So what are you thinking about this ?
So what was the impact ?
That &apos;s what happened here . Not a team of a <unk> .
As a result of a <unk> could be built , there would be the cost of school for home .
Is it not interesting , and how many of you have a big effect ?
So we &apos;ve got a job with the same <unk> .
So what does this happen ?
Now you know the good success .
So it was a big , <unk> team at the best .
You &apos;ve got the center in the last time in the same time .
And it &apos;s really <unk> <unk> for us , about those nature , or job .
You might look at the question : Why would anyone do more <unk> ?
And the reason is , I think , digital tools , and we are creating the same kind of teams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And the idea that it &apos;s doing is , in fact , in order to identify them in order to identify <unk> <unk> .
Because of course , every project has got your job .
And the uitdaging makes a common sense , which is a common opportunity called <unk> , which is the actual prototype prototype .
And this is the quality of the experience , which is so simple .
And then you know , you know , it can have been <unk> .
It &apos;s a blog , which you see , which is called the <unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> here .
You can find <unk> examples of all the world , which is the way people in the West , and <unk> .
And it &apos;s very <unk> .
And the basic idea that we believe is , in fact , is that , in fact , is a <unk> sport .
It means that we have all the sense of the way that we focus on the job , and that we think our way in the future , which we are , in the future , which we are .
And so , soms is a small prototype of mine everything , and a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; .
And this is a big difference .
Thank you .
So we are doing something like this .
A big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
And every one in this room has to be able .
And you can go in that <unk> , you can go in the future , and you can stay in here and right now .
And I &apos;m wondering , well , I &apos;m going to ask you , because I &apos;ve got my friends in the last time , and they wanted to get all of the time in that <unk> .
I don &apos;t know . You wanted to go back to that time , for the auto , of Twitter , or Twitter for America .
I don &apos;t know .
And I &apos;m sure that you have to be a little bit of the way that we have to do with it .
And I snap .
I &apos;m not part of this kind of kind of thing .
I &apos;m not in that time , and that &apos;s not because I &apos;m a <unk> .
It &apos;s the way that the future of this planeet is not going to go back .
I will put in this machine , and I will .
This is that <unk> time , which you could do on this planeet , which is you , for example , for example , which shows you , gezondheidszorg , <unk> , providing care , <unk> .
And there was no way of a time .
I &apos;d be found , though , all of these <unk> were all the time .
I mean , my kids were doing this getal on <unk> .
My ouders are the 80 at the time .
That &apos;s going to be a little bit of a second in the beginning of my head at the same time .
But it &apos;s not even more than us , because this is a larger thing .
So a kind of kind of kind of kind of being born in <unk> , so long to live in the world for 100 years .
Think about it . That &apos;s a really wonderful one .
And why is it so ?
You know , the pokken . The pokken have had to be a billion people on this planet .
You &apos;ve got that <unk> of the Earth on the surface of the Earth , which is not the time you get .
It &apos;s gone . You &apos;re dead .
We &apos;ve got them <unk> . <unk> .
In the rijke world , there are different diseases , which is one of the millions of us , not even again .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
Well , one of a sudden that is that ?
<unk> , modern geneeskunde , our ability to eat , to have a lot of people , which are <unk> for the most important approach .
And from my view , the evidence is that evidence , in fact , is the way that it works , in order to change it , as it does not make any of the world .
And this is the good time .
Now , it &apos;s all the way that the Internet is all the way , because he &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve got more <unk> .
And one of the things that we have is that for all of our lives a billion people in the world every single day .
This is a number of weight , and it &apos;s very fast , and it &apos;s <unk> .
And not only this , we &apos;ve been able to use the status of the world <unk> .
drinkwater , <unk> land , <unk> , carbon , gas , gas , even though , and then , as soon as we go from this chaos , we get rid of the chaos of the chaos .
And the question is : can we do this ?
And I believe that we can be able to generate voedsel , which is a $ 100 human population , if they live .
And I think , we can provide the world with power , which is not going to destroy .
I believe it &apos;s really , and nee , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
But this right right now right now right now right now -- one of the things that I want to do was right now .
And we &apos;ve never seen it in the way that we have to do .
So we are quite exciting , interesting events in many different areas . And anyway , I believe that we &apos;ve had so many , 300 years before that time , in which we &apos;ve been thinking about this time , in which we have a time , in which we have all of these things <unk> , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , have more <unk> .
And those people <unk> in their belief , and it &apos;s so scary that you can &apos;t afford them .
Not even the truth goes to them .
And you know , everybody has a right to one right person in the mind , but one of the truth to be in the future , for the first time .
Now you know , don &apos;t you know ?
You don &apos;t have gelijk to their own data . <unk> , you have not .
And I &apos;ve taken a little bit of that .
For a decade , I wrote a artikel in &quot; The New Yorker , &quot; and he wrote a little movie .
And I was verbaasd , and I was listening to battle by battle by that <unk> <unk> in the human history in human history .
I didn &apos;t know what I was doing , and I was a little bit of the time , and then I had a artikel for the time .
And so quickly , I &apos;d like to read a artikel about <unk> .
All right , it &apos;s different .
They were <unk> .
And so I also wrote a artikel , and I couldn &apos;t understand why those who thought was &quot; <unk> , &quot; and why they were thought of how they were in a particular kind of <unk> as a particular kind of <unk> as a little bit of the nature .
But you know , I was playing . I was in the artikel , I went through .
I &apos;m a journalist .
We can draw , and we &apos;re going to eat .
But this artikel took me , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and then , finally , I was going to get it .
And this is the reason that this was <unk> , which was not <unk> at all .
These were <unk> people , <unk> people , <unk> people .
They were net who people in this room .
And that allowed me to be here .
And then I thought , you know , you know , you know .
We are a point of course , if we look at the exact same line , which we have to be in the past .
And we &apos;ve got the reason for it .
And we have reason with the very first time , in fact , &quot; <unk> &quot; .
All right , well , it &apos;s important , and I think you know what .
And we have the vertrouwen in the societies , in the way , in the spirit , and sometimes in that wetenschap , and there &apos;s no more than that .
There &apos;s a couple of <unk> and those people are going to be .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
I mean , you know , you know , you can take your hand .
Now , there are questions and <unk> with people , or the people , or how they were <unk> .
If you ask questions , desire , desire , desire .
If you look at it as well .
But now , if you &apos;ve got bewijs , you should be able to do this bewijs , and we are not really happy .
And I can tell you that we &apos;re going to say that we are in a epidemie where I &apos;ve never seen them before , and hopelijk never see it .
It was a story about 12 years ago , a little bit of <unk> , which that <unk> with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
All right .
Now , <unk> studies were then taken out of the way .
<unk> studies should be done ; it &apos;s a creative thing .
And those data came down .
And those data coming out of the United States , from England , from Canada , from Canada , and they were all the way , not all of the way , not a lot , not a lot .
It &apos;s not a difference . It &apos;s not a difference , because we believe that we &apos;ve been able to think of science , and we think of what we really really have .
And we don &apos;t believe in a real time , or a <unk> , which we are going to do , and I know that we know all .
But you know ?
And the result of it was <unk> .
<unk> roads : The United States is one in the world , which is one in the world in the world , in which it is that <unk> for <unk> .
This is <unk> , and we should be .
It &apos;s terrible .
So what we did was that we can do that .
Now , I begrijp that . That &apos;s what I do .
Because there &apos;s somebody <unk> here ?
Now , if you have a single one in the publiek , you see a person in the audience ?
It &apos;s not very much a lot .
<unk> in this country was not true , but <unk> for the world in the last decade .
That &apos;s a lot of people by <unk> , 20 per uur .
But because this is not what we &apos;re doing here , and people who are <unk> , and people who can go and explain to them , and we have a little bit of fun of the fear of <unk> , and Larry King &apos;s <unk> .
And they can do that , because they engage and engage with it .
You don &apos;t know if these things seem to be , but it &apos;s not going to be <unk> .
And this is something that we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
This guy was a held , Jonas <unk> .
There &apos;s one of the ergste things that we did by the world of the world .
Not fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
This guy in the middle of it is not that .
There &apos;s Paul <unk> .
There &apos;s actually a couple of different people in a couple of different people .
There can be a life of <unk> , 500,000 kids per week in the ontwikkelingslanden .
Pretty good , right ?
Now , this is good , though Paul <unk> , and over and over and saying , who &apos;s going to say , and say , well , you know , and the people in order to stop .
And this says something like this .
Paul is a <unk> .
Now , if Paul in a public <unk> , there &apos;s no way you can have <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s always <unk> , because those people tell him how they want to go to school .
And why ? Because there was Paul a <unk> .
I don &apos;t need to say , but users are <unk> .
You know , you know , you get to get rid of the ziekte , and it &apos;s kind of <unk> .
So we &apos;ve got in this country <unk> .
And it &apos;s more likely , and it &apos;s going to be more likely to eat , because this is just a question of number .
And they &apos;re not just <unk> .
So what is it with <unk> ? Can we ask .
A <unk> of mine has been written for a few weken , and I think about it .
No one got you before .
She &apos;s not the kind of kind of kind of kind of not .
<unk> .
Why ? Because we haven &apos;t got <unk> .
We &apos;ve never had a <unk> in this country .
Now , I don &apos;t know , you know , I &apos;m not going to get a visit of a vliegtuig in Lagos in a vliegtuig , and it &apos;s in the moment of Los Angeles , in the moment of Ohio .
And then , in a few months , there &apos;s a little car , and there &apos;s going to go through Long Beach , and there &apos;s one of the <unk> <unk> here , and there &apos;s one of these <unk> <unk> here .
And there &apos;s no way that there is a <unk> ziekte , and we don &apos;t know , because we don &apos;t know , because the world works .
That &apos;s the planet , in the way we live . Don &apos;t look like it .
We love it ; we love it .
Have you ever leave all of your children right now ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , which help you have to help .
I know that you &apos;ve done this , because those of the American , which is all the time .
You take that stuff , and they take a single choice , and it makes no difference , which is not a matter of the way that it is <unk> .
And those data points out there .
You get your urine of your urine . There &apos;s nothing like that .
That &apos;s fine , you want to get for 28 dollars to be eaten .
I &apos;d be here .
<unk> . <unk> .
Why are we doing this ?
Well , I believe , we know -- we haten the <unk> .
We haten a high school . We have no vertrouwen in the system .
And we should not even get rid of our time .
It &apos;s more <unk> by people .
It &apos;s absolutely amazing , and it &apos;s really beautiful to us .
So we go through the way , and where are we doing ?
We go in the poor .
That &apos;s super . I love that <unk> .
But you know , it &apos;s really a good good thing , because it &apos;s crap , and we have a $ <unk> .
And I &apos;ve got all sorts of <unk> here .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , da weiß ich nicht , was das ist , aber wir haben <unk> .
And you know ? Well , I &apos;m going to ask you the guys , and say , &quot; Well , what does it give you care ? Let &apos;s get those guys ?
So they get kind of right . &quot;
And you know ? You &apos;ve got <unk> .
Because it &apos;s why it says , &quot; Hmm , I ’ m going to say , &quot; Hmm , I ’ m going to say , &quot; Hmm , I ’ m going to say , &quot; Oh , you know , of the same kind of <unk> , which is the same kind of <unk> , which is the patient .
Now , if you start looking at this pad , and the magic and magic and the magic , the way you can &apos;t do .
You know , you get to <unk> <unk> in Zuid-Afrika .
There was 400,000 people there , because there was a lot of <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> as a result of <unk> drugs , which we know about AIDS , or as we know about AIDS .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in a country , which is when each other of these ziekte has been <unk> .
Don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
They have them . They &apos;ve got them .
Now , that <unk> epidemie , in which we are at the same time , is this <unk> conflict between the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
It &apos;s a great argument . You should stop .
It &apos;s a debate about the words , in the sense of sense .
This is ideologie , right ?
Everything we eat , every single time we eat , every single gun , every single gun , was the people in the world .
Well , you know , it was not <unk> in the paradijs .
There was no <unk> . There was no <unk> . We &apos;ve done everything .
We &apos;ve done in the afgelopen three years .
And it &apos;s hard for it , and it &apos;s not <unk> .
We are <unk> , which is not working .
Now we can look at it , and we have an impact , but we can be able to do something like it , and it can help have millions of people , and you can help have miljoenen people , and you know , thousands of people .
You don &apos;t want you ?
I &apos;m not going to say that .
So we see what we see when we were doing a little bit better .
Why ?
Now , I &apos;m going to say , well , if I want to say , well , it &apos;s a lot of chemicals , <unk> , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to do a big field .
We don &apos;t want to do that , and we don &apos;t want bedrijven .
And we don &apos;t want to do that , and we don &apos;t want businesses .
And you know , was my antwoord about all this ?
Yes , you have right now .
It &apos;s wrong , we &apos;ve got a huge <unk> , but it &apos;s not science .
It has nothing to do with wetenschap .
It &apos;s natural , moral , <unk> .
You know , you know that the wetenschap is not a company .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even a concept ; it &apos;s a proces .
It &apos;s a proces , and so sometimes it &apos;s not , but the concept that we have to do is that we have to do the question that we have to do , because we really have a real <unk> , and they want to get a real <unk> , and they want to get miljoenen people out of the way .
Well , you know , in the next 50 years , we have 70 percent of food , and 70 percent .
This investment in Africa in the afgelopen 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
You have that , and we &apos;ve got it .
And why ? What ? What ?
We don &apos;t want people to eat , and we want to eat it as well .
<unk> is something that is a half miljard people .
It &apos;s like a <unk> .
It &apos;s just a separate <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have any food , it &apos;s not proteïne , and as a scientists , all of that .
And then those people could eat it , and they would not be blind .
You wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , and you know ?
That &apos;s really cool . It wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it was really .
And everything I want to say is , why should we get this ?
I &apos;m wondering , why are we getting rid of this ?
Because what we want to do with you is not a natural ?
It &apos;s not about , of course , Gene <unk> . It &apos;s not about chemicals .
It &apos;s not about our <unk> passion for it , which is our ability of food , a little bit of food , food , <unk> .
It &apos;s not about Rice <unk> , it &apos;s about to get people in the way , and it &apos;s always the time that it means .
Because you know ?
Now , if we don &apos;t even do that as we go even further than where we are , I believe , you know , it &apos;s not guilty , high-tech <unk> .
There &apos;s no other evidence for that , and it &apos;s here .
It &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s bad , it &apos;s not <unk> , and we &apos;ve really got that really .
After all this very rare , you &apos;d say , &quot; Do you want to say , &quot; Do you want to say , &quot; Do you want to say in these <unk> <unk> and in the future ? &quot;
All right . All right .
Now , in the moment , in the present , in the present , we &apos;ve got a fantastic opportunity .
And we can get this <unk> for everything we want .
So we can <unk> them , and we can do them with them , and we can move them in the way we want .
And we &apos;ve got this time , and we &apos;ve got to think , but if we go in those <unk> , we &apos;ve got to go in those <unk> , and in the future , we &apos;ve got a long time .
I know that we can be able , and at the top of it , it &apos;s really what the world needs .
Thank you . Thank you .
If Steve <unk> , in the Los Angeles Times , there was a long time in the middle of Los Angeles in Los Angeles , and there was a great love .
She was a man , a man , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who had only two <unk> , which was only two <unk> .
Many of you have seen that story , because of <unk> papers wrote a book called <unk> , which was getting <unk> , and Jamie <unk> , as Steve <unk> and Jamie <unk> , in the middle of <unk> , was <unk> <unk> , which was <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> , which was <unk> <unk> .
<unk> followed by <unk> , <unk> , 30 years later , and 30 years later lived in the straten of <unk> <unk> in Los Angeles .
Now , I &apos;m going to read all of you , <unk> boek , and look at the film , so you know , but not just a little bit of feeling that between these both of these things , and then , as those love , which is the way that the muziek is making , which is the instrument that allows you to do , which is the instrument that allows you to get rid of the straat .
And I photographed Mr. <unk> in 2008 , for two years , in the <unk> , <unk> Hall .
There was a show of a show of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and it took me from that podium for me .
There was in a really <unk> , and then <unk> , and Hillary <unk> , Hillary Clinton , and then , as those <unk> <unk> , it would be never even the way that the <unk> <unk> of the world was going in the front of the world , and all the way of the world in the world for the first time .
And we went to talk a little bit like a story , and a few months later , I took a e-mail , in the state , which was <unk> for me .
Now , I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; Well , you &apos;ve got a <unk> computer , because there was all the time with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , a <unk> , which is the way that he has been doing .
And if we look at it , it &apos;s really hard for these <unk> , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so bad , and then it turns out to <unk> , in the way , in the straten of <unk> <unk> , in the straten , in the straten of <unk> <unk> , and all the way of its own .
And in fact , in fact , in the middle of the age , if we were at the same time , if we went to the first one in the <unk> Disney Hall , there was an <unk> <unk> in their eyes , and there was completely <unk> .
There was a <unk> <unk> and rook , and he was , who was in the position of somebody in the slaap .
I was scared , not <unk> , but I was able to get rid of the way that there was going to be able to go into one of these places , and then I could see him in the world , and then there was a little bit more profound than I went through , and other exciting ways of <unk> .
So I started playing .
I did the first set of <unk> <unk> .
And then , when I got there , I got a little bit of the time , and a <unk> change was going to be a <unk> .
It was , if it was under the impact of a onzichtbare <unk> , a chemical reactie , which was my game .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in fact , in the past , in fact , in a deep sense and <unk> .
And then , as a wonder , it took place , and then I went , to hear a lot of <unk> , and then asked me , &quot; Hey , she &apos;s going to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And then we were then , in the way , across the way , across the way , across the way of Beethoven , <unk> , <unk> , and all of those others <unk> , or all those other people , or <unk> <unk> .
And I realized that there was not just a science of love talking to love with muziek , but it &apos;s really a scary personal experience .
There was one of the things that I &apos;d like to do with was a kind of understanding of the way that I was different from my businesses in the middle of Los Angeles .
And by there , there was a love of love , and he was in love with this <unk> man , which has gone through those straten , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> .
Muziek is education .
And for example , for example , is a very good love .
Because it allows me to give it to him , and then it <unk> with the arts and creativiteit in something called <unk> .
And so it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
And I remember that this kind of thing is the way that the nature is .
And this is what we &apos;re saying is that we &apos;re all in the way that we are all in the way that in all of us , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , if we care about it , in the traditional lens , we can create .
And the essence of that , which is all of us , and then , inspired , inspired , and our way .
So what <unk> <unk> , so he brought it into a community of a community or a family .
And the <unk> power of the muziek was in a family or muzikanten , which was the arts <unk> and he was <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to go back with <unk> <unk> , and of course , in fact , in fact , in the middle of Disney , <unk> Hall , because there &apos;s me thinking why I &apos;ve become an artist .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Thank you . Thank you .
Robert <unk> .
Robert <unk> : So I &apos;d like to play a little bit , which I &apos;d like to do with the <unk> .
And I really hope , you know .
I am for Jane <unk> . I <unk> <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve been a little bit of 10 years old , and my goal for the next decade is , in the next decade , in order to make the world in the reality , which is the world in the reality .
I want a plan for it . I want to do more people , including you all , more time with the game and <unk> games .
We want to spend three billion hours of a week in a week .
Some of you may say , &quot; Well , this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
Now , perhaps a little bit more time , if you think about how many problems we have to do in the real world .
But in fact , my research research in the future for the future , is the opposite of the future .
It &apos;s only 3 to a week of a week of a week ; it &apos;s not nearly enough to solve the world .
And in fact , I &apos;m overtuigd that , if we want to have the next eeuw to do this , we need to be more likely to be more likely .
I mean , you know , that the potential for 21 miljard per week has been a week at 21 .
It seems to be a little bit more <unk> , even though I want to do this , as we look at the issues , as we look forward , as long as we look at honger , poverty , global conflict , and the future , you believe , should be online for 21 to 21 .
Now , if you go to the next stage , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m really sorry .
Why ?
And the way I believe is that games for the survival of the human species are in the future .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
There was the name of it in play with play . And so there &apos;s a little camera in there .
This is one of the original terms in play .
Now , if you are not a joke , you may have some of the <unk> in this picture .
Now you see this kind of <unk> , which is a little bit of fear , but it &apos;s going to be <unk> , in the context of a really difficult time .
Now , if you look at it , you see a couple of <unk> here , which is going to put it in front of you and give it a hint of alternatives . Those are <unk> .
This is a speaker , which is the map of a <unk> <unk> .
Oh , you know . OK .
So we &apos;ve got some of this .
Now a little bit of the time is a little bit of the time that it &apos;s pretty likely that you were not aware of that before .
It was <unk> about the failure . And as if you were to get rid of it .
That you might be able to be able to do this .
This is a letter of a <unk> <unk> .
And this is what we &apos;re looking at , and if we look at it in the world , we &apos;ve got to see if we look at it as we look at the next eeuw of the next eeuw . And that &apos;s the way that the way of all the way in the way that we have to put on the top of the line in the line .
Well , what we &apos;re looking for is this kind of face in the universe , when we have a very , very <unk> problems .
I want it to be &quot; in the way &quot; in the future .
And it &apos;s my gezicht , you see ? Yes ?
And this is what I &apos;m saying , &quot; In life , I &apos;m bad .
This is a <unk> in my friend in Berkeley , in Berkeley , where I was in my 20s , and in my 20s , in fact , in the form of life .
This is a problem , which is a question of a couple of <unk> .
And we think that we are not really good at the reality .
And I &apos;m not even more successful , as I look at it .
So we &apos;re going to be able to change it again .
I mean , in the context , in the context , which is something called <unk> , inspired by samenwerking .
Now , if we are in a business model , I believe that many of us in our best piece of view , every one of us , the problem , is the issue of the solution to the problem , which is really long for the time , which is even long before it &apos;s going back again .
And in the reality , when we fail , when we go to obstakels , we feel very differently .
We are naked , and we get rid of our time , and we feel you , you know , maybe <unk> , gefrustreerd .
These are the gevoelens we don &apos;t know when we play games , in games , in the game .
And that &apos;s what I found when I wanted to look like <unk> .
Why is it that in the game you don &apos;t want to think about everything ?
Now , who can we look at these gevoelens in the context of the reality ?
So I &apos;d like playing games or the World of Warcraft , which is that the ideal environment is the ideal environment .
And I discovered some of the things that <unk> <unk> in <unk> for the time .
So , first of all , if you go in one of these <unk> , you know , in the World of Warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters , which are ready , you know , a <unk> missie , and that &apos;s directly .
But not just a question , but a Mission , which is perfect , which perfect was perfect for your current level , right ?
So you get that .
You won &apos;t get a job , which you can &apos;t solve .
But then , when you get to Rand your ability , you need to change .
But it &apos;s not Chinese in the World of Warcraft . Man zit not in front of it , and you have a little bit more to do it again .
And it &apos;s <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to go through , <unk> by people , which you &apos;re going to do with you , for example , to you , in order for your <unk> .
And this is not the real life in the real world that we &apos;ve got to get a <unk> .
And so he has this <unk> verhaal , and this <unk> story , which we are , and then we &apos;ve got to do this . And then we get there .
You know , it &apos;s like &quot; level &quot; level , and &quot; + 1 will &quot; or &quot; + 1 &quot; .
Now this is a lot of <unk> feedback in the real life .
Now , when I go out this podium , I don &apos;t say , you &apos;re going to say , + 1 <unk> concept , $ 20 <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get a lot of life in the face .
Now , the problem that the Internet or the World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so <unk> , in fact , in the way that it &apos;s almost like , in fact , in the way we have a little bit of the top of the time in these <unk> .
It &apos;s better as the reality .
All right , for example , all of the World , or three years ago , took a little bit of <unk> and <unk> in the virtual trouble .
That &apos;s not necessarily a little bit .
It may seem <unk> .
But then , in the context , in the context , for example , has been a <unk> , <unk> miljoen years , of course , to begin to go back .
This is the first time of <unk> .
All right now , even though we want to spend a time at the time , which is the only time you want to change the time in terms of the time in terms of the time in terms of the human space in terms of time .
But as well as it turns out , that we &apos;re going to be able to use this time , which is the way that we have to change the world .
And we &apos;re starting to get rid of the way that we have to do with it .
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s why I believe .
Now , if you look at this interesting stage , which recently was that one of the Carnegie Mellon University was written by Carnegie Mellon , which was in a country , in fact , in a country , in fact , in a form of <unk> of <unk> to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> .
So , 10,000 months is a very interesting thing , two redenen .
For example , for example , in the United States in the United States , in the same time that they put in the school , which is in the school of the high school , from the high school to the High School of the high school -- as we haven &apos;t solved here .
<unk> , in the young people , in the young people , was to say , is a good piece of choice , which is in the school .
And maybe some of you know about this , or Malcolm <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; , you know , you know the theorie of the way that you know about the way that the question of 10,000 hours .
You know , if you look at the great studies of the design , that , if we look at 10,000 <unk> , we &apos;ve been able to put in the middle of the time <unk> to the right , and we have to put it in the past .
So we were doing this kind of thing , even more than the human world .
So what we &apos;ve got here is a completely generatie jonge people , who are <unk> .
And the big question is , &quot; Well , what is it going to say , &quot; Well , are it <unk> ? &quot;
Because if we could look at this , we &apos;ve never seen before <unk> <unk> .
So many people we have in the world in the world , which is at least a half uur per dag .
This is our <unk> . 500 miljoen people , which was pretty good at one .
And in the next decade , we &apos;ve got another $ a big deal , which was pretty good .
If you don &apos;t hear it ?
And those <unk> <unk> , the power of energy , the power rate , in terms of the <unk> , so that the other people around the world , in fact , in India , in China , in China , Brazilië online .
You might expect a thousand to the next decade by the next decade .
So we &apos;ve got a million <unk> .
So I was starting to say , &quot; Well , what is it , what is the game of our games ?
Here &apos;s these four things that I found . So , as the first thing : <unk> .
All right , let me show you as extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do a little bit of thing to you , in order to do with the belief that we have a <unk> for .
And there &apos;s always a question of that , and it &apos;s going to be more <unk> , and that it &apos;s going to be better .
That &apos;s not what we have .
<unk> are <unk> in the spinnen closer together .
There &apos;s a lot more interesting studies that show you that we are more comfortable , because we &apos;ve got more interesting when we call them <unk> .
And the reason for that is that it &apos;s a lot of knowledge , which is a lot of the game .
And we really have to believe that there &apos;s time with our time , which is the way that those lines are <unk> , and then we have all the time .
And so for example , it makes sense of <unk> , and it &apos;s necessary and education .
And if we do this , we &apos;re making <unk> social relationships .
<unk> . Great .
Well , you know , there &apos;s a solution , which is a state of <unk> or 22 uur per week , as it does .
And the reason is that when we are playing , as we are , we are really interested in how to do , as if we are listening , or not .
Now we know if we think of as a human nature , as we get hard , great job .
And what we &apos;re missing is a lot of hard work when they get the correct job .
And finally , it makes sense .
And here &apos;s how we love it , and it &apos;s kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So here a little bit of a little bit of the straight line in the straight line . You know all about all the Wikipedia , which is the highest <unk> of the world .
This is the 10 <unk> of the world , which is the World of 10 <unk> <unk> .
Five thousand people are using every maand .
You &apos;ve got more information about the World or Warcraft of Warcraft in the Internet , if you look at anything else in the world .
So you have a <unk> verhaal .
So you create a <unk> source of the kennis or of Warcraft .
All right , it &apos;s four <unk> , which is to get a little bit different . <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s people who believe that they believe that they can change the world .
And the only question is that they believe , in fact , they can change the virtual werelden , but not that real .
This is the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
Edward <unk> is a <unk> .
His job is briljant . There &apos;s an amazing question .
It &apos;s a lot of time , the power and the money in <unk> .
And there says , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to be solved by not as much as a <unk> in virtual werelden and <unk> . &quot;
And this one of a graphic . So it makes sense .
And there &apos;s ... not even who I ... I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m a little .
And so there &apos;s this idea that makes sense , because spelers can be able to change more than in the universe .
You can look at it in play with <unk> <unk> as in the form of life , and you get more feedback , and it &apos;s going to be more feedback and <unk> in games .
And so there &apos;s a really profound way that it &apos;s going on in the virtual world as a real time in the virtual world .
I &apos;m only going to get rid of that .
But it &apos;s absolutely not <unk> .
So we &apos;ve been able to change the real world in a game .
My <unk> comes from a gebeurtenis , for 2,500 years .
Well , it &apos;s like this <unk> , or <unk> . Do you know ?
So for this wonderful <unk> , it was <unk> .
And that was the first time of people <unk> . And as you know , and then you know when you &apos;ve got the job of the oude Griekse <unk> <unk> , you know , you &apos;ve got this verhaal , and that &apos;s why and why games have taken .
And according to <unk> , games were playing games , in fact , <unk> <unk> , in fact , <unk> as a famine .
And it was a long long time , which was so high high famine , which was the koning of <unk> .
Those people suffer . Those people vochten .
It was a very extreme situation . Man needed a extreme solution .
And so they call it , <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> a long job would be .
And in fact , they were in the middle of the <unk> , and so it &apos;s really fascinerend , and in fact , in fact , it would be surprised , in fact , that it would be not even <unk> .
And then , then , the next dag would be playing . And the next dag would you eat .
And the idea of <unk> , they lived for 18 years long , when they were high school , and in the next minute .
So , I think , well , we &apos;re going to have some games .
And we &apos;re going to put games a little bit of the experience in the human world . And we &apos;re going to have some games , which is not working in the real world , which is not working in the real world , and we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
But this is not the end .
That &apos;s that <unk> .
And by <unk> , after 18 years old , they didn &apos;t get a job as long as the koning , one of the gentleman , in the middle of the Middle East .
You would get it in two <unk> .
And you speelden with a <unk> , and they had <unk> to a <unk> avontuur .
You know , when it took off , and they took place in a new town , and you &apos;ve got to get so many people back , as it was for the rest of the rest of the rest , in the rest of an area , in which they were .
That &apos;s absurd .
But the final <unk> show of that <unk> , which is when it comes to <unk> <unk> , which is the same kind of DNA who <unk> <unk> .
And so , as a scientist , scientists , in the way , is that <unk> <unk> really wrong .
<unk> found bewijs for a global economy , which was almost 20 , which was going to be able to explain high school .
So this <unk> <unk> .
Now , if they were able to do their people through games , you know , 18 years old in games , and then they had <unk> and so forth , and so forth , so many of you have taken all over the world , and so many of you have learned that the entire world has gotten that entire civilization .
So , we can also .
So we are playing for 1994 .
It was the first time in real time .
That &apos;s the World or <unk> . It was 16 years old .
So you &apos;ve taken 18 years long , and we were playing for 16 years .
I &apos;m going to say , we are ready for our own <unk> .
So , they took that percent of their beschaving in that search for a new world . And so I &apos;m going to take my 21 billion <unk> per week .
And we &apos;d be able to put it in the same time that the time of a single day of a single day , if we &apos;ve taken the problems of the human world .
I want you to ask , &quot; Well , who do we solve problems in the world ?
And in play ? &quot; And in fact , this question , I &apos;m my job in the world in the world , in the first time .
So we &apos;ve got this <unk> in our kantoor in the middle of <unk> <unk> , and it would like to get out of the future .
And we don &apos;t want to ask the future for you .
So what we want to do is that the future .
And we want to get this kind of best , and then people in the past , in that sense , in that sense , in that sense .
So what we &apos;re looking for is a lot of <unk> <unk> and giving people to help them .
So , I &apos;m going to show you a little piece of movies , which I &apos;m working for , and I &apos;m going to give you a lot of people in their future .
This is &quot; the world right now . &quot;
This game is from 2007 .
It &apos;s a <unk> , in which you have a <unk> .
And that <unk> is uitgevonden , but we &apos;ve got enough <unk> , and you have your real life as well as you can live with , and you know , as if you are <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , which is going to be , you know , which is not one of the food cost , which is it , it would be <unk> .
You know , as the transport of energy , from school , it &apos;s going to be <unk> . And you &apos;ve got to figure out how to create your real life as it was true . And we try to figure out how to look .
So we &apos;ve got this game with <unk> <unk> in 2007 , and we &apos;ve got them since that number of three years .
And I ’ m going to say , it was a <unk> experience .
No one wants to change their lives , because it &apos;s good for the environment , or we should .
But if you were in a <unk> avontuur , and they said , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to have the olie . &quot;
This is a really beautiful avontuur of that .
And then you &apos;d like , who you were going to be . And the most important one we &apos;ve got to do in the game , which is the answer in the face of <unk> .
So what we &apos;ve done is what we have to do for the next time we have a higher , more , more than just <unk> .
So we have the game called &quot; <unk> &quot; at the Institute for the future .
It &apos;s going to be the berekening of a <unk> , which is the people alone for 23 years .
This supercomputer called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; , <unk> .
And we call the question of a piece of cheese , and we &apos;ve created a &quot; <unk> &quot; .
You know , Jerry <unk> , which is the &quot; <unk> . &quot; You &apos;ve got the <unk> , the scientists , and you can see them , and you can see the world .
But in our context , in the same time , we say , you know , every single person in the world , and it &apos;s our job , which is our job , the future for power , food , veiligheid and the future of natural rechtvaardigheid .
For example , 8,000 letters speelden eight weken long .
You know , you &apos;ve got 500 <unk> <unk> , which you can say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And the final piece of the next piece of weeks is that we have a piece of paper in samenwerking with the Wereldbank .
If you take the game , you get through the Wereldbank , which is the World <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
We are working with universiteiten in a way of <unk> and sending them a , sociaal <unk> .
So we &apos;ve got a strip in there . We &apos;ve got &quot; level &quot; for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , vision and <unk> .
So I &apos;d like to share all of you all the time , with young people , in the world , in the world , all in the world , all the way together , in order to take care of their own , in order to help out their world .
I &apos;m going to go right now .
So I &apos;d like to ask you a little question .
So what , why do you think of this ?
And we &apos;ve got all the great characters , we have games that we can show you , but we have the real world , but we have the real world again .
Well , I hope , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got some kind of solution , which we have to be able to engage with the job in the form of life , and that games have a huge quality for change .
And we &apos;ve got this all the time , <unk> , <unk> , making sense , scary social <unk> , <unk> and the desire to make sense .
And I really really hope that we are going to play a lot of great games , for example , in the same eeuw .
And I hope , you know , you have to design with me .
Now , if I look at the next decade , I &apos;m going to be in the next 10 things that we can create , and we can get all sorts of ways , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Well , let &apos;s really start playing the game .
Thank you .
Now , for a long time , I &apos;m interested in the math . And it may seem crazy , it &apos;s because , you know , as I look , as I think , as I think , as I think , as a <unk> , which is something called the <unk> , which is something called <unk> .
Now , with other words , in some cases , in some studies , has given a <unk> effect , and this is simply why that person thinks in the way that someone thinks about it , is one of the type of type of Art , or kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of <unk> in het lichaam , of man <unk> .
It &apos;s one of it to something called <unk> , because somebody &apos;s making it .
And then we &apos;ve got to get rid of each other &apos;s way , and I &apos;ll show you a little bit frightening .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . That &apos;s a truc , which is the case of all the <unk> in every single world for kids .
And so I &apos;d like to put it through the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the North America .
I &apos;m going to give it for you , and then you can explain .
And then I &apos;m going to explain why I &apos;m going to show him .
So , look , you see it .
And the baby , that you can look at ; my hand , which you can look at .
So I &apos;m going to put it in my hand .
I &apos;m going back to my teeth .
And so , in fact , it &apos;s not something in my teeth , or by the way , it &apos;s going to be here , in fact , here &apos;s my leg right here .
Now , if you can look at this , you can see from no time . , as long as I can look at here , I can get rid of it in my run right now .
And the idea is really hard .
Now , I &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopelijk , as all the way it &apos;s kind of kind of kind of is it <unk> through my little sense .
It &apos;s so that the way that it is that I could wear it , and you know it &apos;s a little bit like that .
There &apos;s nothing in my teeth , and it &apos;s going to come , and you can look at it and you can look at all of it .
<unk> !
Now , this is a trick , which I want you to do with a little bit of kids , which is really a lot of fun , because you know it &apos;s a little bit more fun about it , but it &apos;s a really easy way that it &apos;s really hard for <unk> .
Now you know , many of you know here in this room here in this room .
It &apos;s going to work .
And I &apos;m going to put it in my hand .
And I &apos;m saying that I &apos;m going to say , I mean , in fact , in fact , in fact , nothing like that , and then it &apos;s going to come out and then it &apos;s a leugen .
And the reason I &apos;m going to do my hand is that , in fact , is that in the way that it &apos;s really profound is that it &apos;s really profound .
Now , in the moment , where I &apos;m my hand , you know , if you look at it , it &apos;s going to look down here , and then , here &apos;s a little bit here , in fact , where there is this , in fact , where there is it , in fact , in fact , in the way that there is it .
<unk> <unk> ?
That &apos;s the time when she was not born .
So , there &apos;s this .
And then , as I <unk> , the vinger in the face of their face .
Now , this is what you might say about it is why you &apos;re not going to remind you that there are only three seconds to see here : because of all the way , and that kind of thing , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , one , two , three , but they look as a little , two , three .
But this is actually not right now , and then my hand open my hand .
And it turns out that it &apos;s got it , but not through the <unk> of my body , but by a way , it &apos;s going to be here .
And then , when I get my hand , and then , in fact , when I get rid of this , it &apos;s hidden through this , and it &apos;s hidden away from all of the eyes .
I &apos;m going to take this hand . And here &apos;s the baby .
This is an argument that you can do with your vrienden and listen . Thank you .
Well , what did that do with the <unk> ?
For a year , I read a period of time , which was really <unk> .
I &apos;m not arts and scientists , and so it was a great thing .
And this is something like this : as if you care about it , as if you care about it in the form of an <unk> , it &apos;s a little bit of paper in the form of a <unk> , which has a particular effect .
But if you have that shape , in the case of you , in fact , in a smaller space , which is in a smaller charge , and one of the blauw , and one letter , it &apos;s really powerful .
And this , as though , is not one of the time , but it &apos;s just <unk> .
But it &apos;s not a white line , which is not exactly a <unk> .
What ? That &apos;s what I did .
But it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
Now , when you get rid of it , it &apos;s the same kind of <unk> as a child .
A little <unk> , which is when it &apos;s going to be warm and it &apos;s a little bit better as a white <unk> .
And it &apos;s the same kind of <unk> .
A mouse is only dying for every single one of who &apos;s three <unk> -- and I &apos;m not going to get rid of the exact question .
It &apos;s really cool .
And this is the idea of that kind of <unk> .
And that shape makes sense .
And then of course , if you have the ultieme <unk> , you need to get a naald .
All right ? It &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> -- a couple of <unk> , which you can get into a patient .
It makes a very big image in the face . It &apos;s really a lot of sterker as a witte pil .
So this slide is really -- I &apos;m going to show you a little bit of a little even more even here when we have a <unk> .
And so that white is not the same as good as it does not seem to look like that <unk> <unk> , which is not so good as it &apos;s not as good as the naald .
And none of this is really <unk> . It &apos;s only how we believe in our part , which is really the one in which we have a <unk> impact .
So I wanted to know , if I could use this concept for a magic magic .
And I &apos;m going to give you a little taste of it , and it looks really like it .
So we know about this trial that you get to the naald in order to get rid of it .
This is a 18 centimeter long time , and it &apos;s very , very <unk> . And I &apos;m going to show you a little bit of a little bit more <unk> .
This is really my vlees . It &apos;s not really <unk> <unk> .
This is my huid . This is not a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to put these naald in my side , and by using them through the others , until they get rid of the others in the other side .
So as well as you look at it -- as if you were in <unk> -- I got a couple of guys in the early days in the early days , and some people that I didn &apos;t know about , and a vrouw , which I did is a vrouw <unk> .
So for example , I even look at it as well as you go through the next 30 seconden . If you look at the next 30 seconden .
So you can see it , but you can look at it as well as you want .
So , this is what &apos;s going on , in my age , when my vlees goes in the air , and I &apos;m a little bit of a little <unk> .
Sorry for me . Do you really have the <unk> ?
And now a little bit of a little bit of my side , and on the other side of the others .
Now we are in the same time , which we &apos;ve done in the same time , which we &apos;ve done with it .
It &apos;s about .
But now you can &apos;t meet my vinger .
So , let me show you . This is one , two , three , four , five .
Yeah ?
I know that those people think about it .
And you say , &quot; Okay , it &apos;s not really dumb , and it &apos;s not the way that you have a couple of minutes , only for a few minutes . &quot;
Well , I &apos;m going to show you that .
Now , who looks like this ? Very good .
Yes , I know . And those people say , &quot; Okay . I don &apos;t know . &quot;
And those people in the space , in the middle of the water ?
So let me show you that by a way of looking at them .
This is really my leg . This is not a <unk> .
That &apos;s my vlees , and I can do it again .
Sorry about it . And if you look , you look away , look , look , look , look , look , look , look , look , look at it .
And those people in the people , which this is going to show you a little bit later , &quot; Well yeah , yeah , it looks like this , but here &apos;s a space and then , as it was really , there &apos;s a space and then , as it really was really , it would really be . &quot;
All right , let me just give you a little .
Yeah , here is it .
Well , as though , I &apos;d like to get that naald .
I &apos;d like my arm &apos;s arm , and you just show you that there &apos;s no <unk> .
But I think , in this space here , and with the notion of something you can do , I &apos;m going to put it in the way that it &apos;s going to put it down there and so on the podium .
And we &apos;re going to have a couple of even more even a couple of even more even a couple of hands .
I hope , you know , it &apos;s really hard . Thank you .
So I &apos;ve got a lot of the same as well .
I only have two <unk> .
This was one of the time , which was more than a gepassioneerde <unk> .
It was a beautiful baby , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and a half of a <unk> .
So what about it .
And yet , again , there was a little bit of better , in the way , in the way , in the middle of the Sun , <unk> .
And then you could get rid of something like that .
I had to be able to relate to this schoonheid across a few maanden .
One moment in the one day the Queen and I said , &quot; You know , what I &apos;d like to talk to you about this is what I &apos;d like to talk to you about .
&quot; Natuurlijk , &quot; I said .
And here was a company that we &apos;ve been trying to solve , which is the idea of this rare solution , and who want to get four to our <unk> ?
In the afgelopen 50 years , we &apos;ve got the ocean <unk> who has taken the world .
It &apos;s hard , which is difficult .
90 percent of the big vissen , which we love , which we love , is that <unk> , which is <unk> , they are <unk> .
It &apos;s fast about it .
Now , of course , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , <unk> , one of our future .
Now , it turns out to be <unk> . <unk> <unk> , which is the end of them , which are the ones that they look at , and they are <unk> .
There &apos;s a $ <unk> by one .
This is a little bit like that , 15 kilo <unk> , so you get a pond of <unk> .
Not really <unk> .
It &apos;s not very good at it .
So here was a company , which made it a little bit .
I wanted them to succeed .
On the day for the first time , I called the Queen <unk> for that .
So we don &apos;t know .
&quot; Don &quot; Don &quot; , &quot; but said , &quot; Just for those feiten , you know it &apos;s a very big deal , so far as it can &apos;t be <unk> . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s why it says , &quot; Well , we are so far away from our vis , and it &apos;s not focus by our vis . &quot;
And then we put it together , &quot; We are in a real world .
This was a &quot; <unk> of 2.5 to one &quot; .
&quot; The best best in the industry . &quot;
Two to one , great .
&quot; Two to one ? What was the case ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> proteïnen &quot; , said there .
&quot; Fantastic &quot; , sagte ich . <unk> .
And one of the time I was sitting in bed , and he was thinking , &quot; Was for the time of the sky ?
So , I &apos;m going to go through the next dag , let me show you .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t say , &quot; Don , was an duurzame proteïnen ? &quot;
There he was not there . There &apos;s <unk> .
Now , I <unk> with a couple of people in the company , and nobody could say a little bit more <unk> .
Now we don &apos;t know .
&quot; Don &quot; Don &quot; , &quot; said , &quot; was an duurzame material ? &quot;
Well , there &apos;s a couple of algen and some of them <unk> , and then he said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
There said , &quot; Yeah , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , who is a matter of <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
For example , maybe two percent .
&quot; Well , this is about 30 percent .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t even say , &quot; Don &apos;t be a <unk> ? &quot;
And there was a long time in the line , and there said , &quot; Well , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the world . &quot;
I &apos;d like to do this .
Nee , not because I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
That &apos;s me .
Nee , I &apos;ve got a little bit of the use of this vis , because , I mean , I &apos;m a little bit of the baby , which is the use of the game , which is four to <unk> .
This is the tweede vis , which is another type of <unk> .
It &apos;s the romantic child , which is kind of like that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the vis of the way it &apos;s about .
I was in a restaurant at a restaurant in the restaurant .
A <unk> <unk> has had a long time about this baby .
You &apos;ve got a little bit of <unk> .
There was an <unk> , in fact , a <unk> , <unk> white .
And he was sold to him .
Five .
<unk> was a little bit of fun .
How many of you could get a vis for how was sold ?
I can &apos;t see it , but this type of idea .
So we are missing . And in fact , there &apos;s Miguel .
No nee , it &apos;s not a kid , and it &apos;s not a chef-kok . Well , you know .
There &apos;s a <unk> for <unk> La <unk> .
This is a <unk> in the middle of the middle wall .
It &apos;s close to the <unk> <unk> .
And then , in that case , in that <unk> was sitting in the handen of <unk> .
You see <unk> <unk> , which was really <unk> .
You did that by that , by the way , they made the land .
So they built this complex speed of <unk> , and they made water out of the land , and then in the rivier .
Now , they couldn &apos;t matter that it was the way that it was <unk> .
And it was a ramp .
It used to be used for 90 percent of the vogels , which was a lot of vogels .
And so , in 1982 , there was a <unk> company called <unk> .
So what did they do ?
You see the rivier of water .
So you &apos;ve got the <unk> <unk> .
So , in the water , they used to use those <unk> , and they used to do the water back .
You &apos;ve got these <unk> .
You &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and so it &apos;s going to be stable and in the water , which is the natural vernietiging of the atmosphere .
It &apos;s really hard .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen this one .
You see , if you look at the horizon , which is a million kilometers away , and all of them were looking for it , and this dense , <unk> <unk> .
I was not even longer time with Miguel .
There &apos;s an awful guy , three of Charles Darwin and a piece of &quot; A &quot; or a <unk> .
Okay ? Well , we were , and when we were , you know , we &apos;ve got to get rid of those <unk> , and I &apos;ve got <unk> to my <unk> , and Miguel <unk> in the sky .
Here &apos;s a zeldzame <unk> .
Well , there &apos;s that <unk> of <unk> .
And here , here , looks like a patroon , which is the <unk> giraffe .
And it turns out that Miguel is the highest in the middle of the world in Africa in Africa .
So I said , &quot; Well , there &apos;s one of the time that we &apos;ve become a <unk> .
There is : &quot; <unk> ? I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m an expert in my mind . &quot;
And then there &apos;s been , and it &apos;s going to be more <unk> of zeldzame vogels and algen and rare <unk> .
And you don &apos;t know , which was really fascinerend , you know , which was really fascinerend , which was really remarkable .
It &apos;s really cool , but I was verliefd .
And my head has been a little bit about this , and he &apos;s a little bit of <unk> <unk> , which I was at .
So I &apos;m going to go there . I said , &quot; Miguel , who does this , and how does it make your use ? &quot;
There was these algen .
&quot; I know , kind of , I know that those algen , which is <unk> , which is terrible .
But was kind of like the vissen ?
Who is that <unk> ? &quot;
Now , there &apos;s been a little bit more like that , and it &apos;s a <unk> system that was going to eat as well as it was in the wild .
And these <unk> variation , which is the <unk> , which is it , it &apos;s the same as the vissen .
This systeem is the better , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
There &apos;s no food .
You know , if you look at a <unk> , which is not <unk> ?
And later , I went down to the day , and I said , &quot; Well , I said , &quot; Well , for a space , which seems to be so important as a child , which seems like , &quot; Who knows , &quot; How do you know ? &quot;
And in the moment he was , as a result of a <unk> <unk> .
And we kind of <unk> around that wall , and we moved through these <unk> , duizenden and <unk> <unk> , a literally <unk> , so that it &apos;s literally <unk> .
It &apos;s kind of said , &quot; It said .
&quot; Look , &quot; in the way , she &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
You have <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? I was completely <unk> .
I said , &quot; Miguel , don &apos;t you know ?
&quot; Yes ! &quot;
&quot; We get 20 percent of our baby , &quot; we get 20 percent .
Now , last year , for example , Indians were growing as 250 as 250 .
It &apos;s the highest and one of the most important private sector in Europe .
And I said , &quot; Miguel , is a really good job not a little bit of <unk> , which is the same kind of thing ? &quot;
There &apos;s their head , no .
There said , &quot; Well , we bouwen <unk> .
This is a <unk> netwerk .
And they go down <unk> .
And they wear <unk> .
So you <unk> the way the job the way the system is better . &quot;
All right , let &apos;s get into the future . A <unk> , which is not a <unk> , which is their job , which is how they kind of <unk> .
A <unk> , but a <unk> .
Oh , and even , if you look at it , this is not going to be there .
You look down in a town , in a town , which sort of <unk> , which is better for the <unk> .
So , after Tomorrow , they fly 240 feet down .
And every night , they fly 240 miles .
You can do that , because they are the <unk> witte trap in the middle of these <unk> <unk> .
All right .
I &apos;ve been looking for a kid of the pinguïns , and I also visited Miguel .
I said , &quot; Miguel , they go down for 240 feet down , and they go down to the night .
Are they doing for those kids ? &quot;
There was a point of Whitney , which was a piece of Whitney Houston .
There says , &quot; Oh . You can do that , because the food is better . &quot;
I &apos;m not going to have the huid of my <unk> , which was kind of <unk> , and I don &apos;t care about it . I can &apos;t get rid of it .
This is the <unk> , <unk> smaak .
I &apos;m not going to be able to do this .
And anyway , if I put them in a restaurant in the restaurant , they didn &apos;t even have to <unk> <unk> .
You look down and in it , if you look at it as a state of the oceaan .
I mean , it had to be Miguel and there &apos;s <unk> .
He said , &quot; That is the side of it as a <unk> .
It &apos;s the burden of <unk> for something in the body .
You &apos;ve evolved into the evolutie of the evolutie , which is called <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And then there &apos;s one of the time , &quot; but you have nothing <unk> . &quot;
Okay . A shop , which is the same kind of <unk> . A <unk> , which is how they kind of <unk> their way .
And then , when it says , &quot; Well , if there &apos;s a shop , which is not a big <unk> , because the water , the water , which is the water , which goes through the rivier from the rivier .
It &apos;s a rivier , which is all those things together , which we tend to do with the right now , which tend to tend to do with it , chemical , <unk> .
And when it comes through the system , and this is the water , it &apos;s blood , as it is .
It &apos;s kind of better , it makes the water .
So , not just a shop , which is not a <unk> , which is not just a shop , which is the way that the quality of the future , but a shop , which letterlijk a little bit of the vissen , and not just for the same as it can be , but for you .
Because when it comes to water , it <unk> in the line .
One bottle in the oceaan , I know , but I &apos;m going to take it , and this is how romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic .
You might say , you know , it &apos;s a recept for the future of the future , if we talk about it , or <unk> .
So what we &apos;ve done is a radicaal new concept of landbouw , or one , in the same time , in the water , in the water , in the way that it &apos;s really good .
But for many people , it is a little bit different .
We are not <unk> , we are <unk> .
We are at the age of <unk> . We love little <unk> . We have the reason for regionale food .
And as soon as you say , that those things are going to tell you about the future , and say , &quot; Hey , people , I love to say , &quot; Hey guys , I love the world ?
Who would you love the world ? &quot;
Mag I wonder ?
Now I don &apos;t know this question .
Nee , not because we have enough calorieën , for example , to produce the world more than only one .
A billion people are now <unk> .
A billion -- this is more than you before -- because of <unk> <unk> in the distributie , not <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m not sure the question is that the logica of the logica for the last 50 years is that the number of 50 years .
<unk> graan in <unk> , <unk> an <unk> , <unk> , chemische <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so forth , so wie viel <unk> <unk> : &quot; Wenn man so viel , was da so <unk> ? &quot;
It was the <unk> . It was that <unk> . It was the <unk> of American .
We &apos;d be called it , which is , in fact , a <unk> in <unk> , and a half of the time <unk> , which has been able to do this .
It &apos;s not a <unk> , and it &apos;s not <unk> .
Now , we &apos;ve been here today , not as though , not since <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> grondstoffen , we have the <unk> grondstoffen .
Now , if you look at that <unk> <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> land , you know , it &apos;s not <unk> , but by <unk> water , it &apos;s not due to <unk> , but in fact , in the bossen , and it &apos;s not as long as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as it happens in the population .
You want the world food ?
So let &apos;s start with the question : How are we going to eat ?
Of course , if we can change the same way that we can change the same community , which is all the community <unk> ?
Now , if you look at that , you don &apos;t look at the same time .
It &apos;s really , and it &apos;s done .
<unk> , chemie and machines , in fact , have never been able to do something really good to eat .
Let &apos;s see in the context of the carbon model .
This is that , in two hundred , <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s get Miguel , for example , <unk> .
For example , those who are not different , you know , companies , in terms of <unk> , companies , in terms of <unk> , in terms of <unk> , which is not just <unk> , <unk> , which is not just <unk> , but experts in the same way .
And because they are the ones that have to be <unk> .
Now , if I really really want to be here , they are a little curious about it if I want you to be .
Well , this is me right now , because of the future , it &apos;s kind of fun .
Thank you .
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> science fiction .
And then I went down to the bus , and I went down to the bus for school .
And my neus , in a book , was a <unk> , which is my mind in other different different <unk> , and in the process of <unk> , which was sort of <unk> nieuwsgierigheid .
So this nieuwsgierigheid showed me when I was not in the high school , when I was in the high school , when I went , and &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; and &quot; monsters , and they were <unk> , and then they went through the microscoop , and then they went through the microscoop .
I was completely <unk> , you know .
It took a little bit of time to understand the world , and those states have been <unk> .
And my good news of science fiction was in my environment , because in the late jaren , in the late , in the late 60s , we took the maan .
Jacques Cousteau in our woonkamer , in our woonkamer , in the way that we were at the same time , and a world , or a world , or a world or a world <unk> , which we never had before .
And this is a pretty good way of doing all the <unk> .
And I was kunstenaar .
I could draw . I could drink .
And he &apos;s not <unk> with this <unk> with <unk> films , which was all the time in the setting of <unk> and I was able to do that in my face .
And we moesten that in the first time , and when we read as a kind of book , we took a look at the number of <unk> and <unk> them in our minds .
And my reactie was the tekenen , and it would look like <unk> , <unk> , robots , and all the way .
And in the case of <unk> , I was completely <unk> , who was , <unk> , <unk> .
And the creativiteit was supposed to go .
And this is interesting interesting thing , and what me was thinking about Jacques <unk> , was the idea of a really <unk> world here in our Earth .
Now , I &apos;d like to get a little bit of a <unk> world with a broken world , and that was quite onwaarschijnlijk .
But here was a world , which I was able to see in the Earth , and it was even remarkable , and it was all of the way that I was telling me for years , if I was a computer .
And so , I decided , if I was 15 was , we decided to go .
And the only thing about this is that I was in a small town in Canada , 1,000 miles of the next time .
And I ’ m not going to get rid of that .
I <unk> my vader , until I was able to get a <unk> in <unk> , in the New York , which was given to the others , which we lived .
I went in a kind of <unk> in the middle of the winter in the winter in <unk> , New York .
Well , the oceaan , but a echte oceaan , I &apos;d only got two years later , when we go to California .
Since then , in the age of 40 , which has been <unk> , I spent about three months under water . 500 hours in the water .
And I like that , and I like that the world in the middle of the world , in the middle of the <unk> , is how we can really be able to imagine .
And the position of the nature of the nature may not be <unk> , especially in the context of human .
And then , at the same time , I was going to get to the end of the time , which I &apos;m looking at in my hand .
And my mother goes down to the oceaan , in the same kind of sense , and you know .
And if I was , if I was a kid , it was the <unk> .
And that was the best possible opportunity , my innerlijke desire , in my need , in my need , <unk> , to create .
If kind of kind of kind of , I took a lot of time .
And so , films , the way we have been , images and verhalen <unk> .
And yes , those stories , which I did , is that <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And when I was in &quot; <unk> , &quot; and I was able to do my job for those <unk> , and the way we connect with these <unk> .
And then <unk> my both are both <unk> .
So something interesting happened to &quot; <unk> &quot; : To solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and we &apos;ve had this idea of a Art <unk> <unk> -- in fact , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So what the first thing about was that was that the first one was to see in a film .
And the film was not a little bit of the film , which was a little bit like this , but besefte I was a little bit more <unk> : the publiek in the world was kind of around the world , which was the story of magic , the way it was <unk> .
Laut Arthur <unk> &apos;s wet &apos;s wet &apos;s wet &apos;s wet <unk> technology , and it &apos;s not more natural .
So you saw something like that .
And that &apos;s really exciting .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s really what should be involved in those <unk> . &quot;
So , we went in &quot; <unk> Two &quot; , and my next film , I went out .
<unk> with <unk> , we created the vent of clean metaal . And it was the way that it was done by this effect .
And it was . And yet , we &apos;ve created something called <unk> . And the impact in the publiek was different . And yet , we &apos;ve got a little bit more money .
For these two <unk> , it was a completely new world , which was a completely new world of the creativiteit .
And so what I did , I took a tool , put in my good friend <unk> <unk> , which was the best <unk> and <unk> . You was called &quot; Digital <unk> . &quot;
And the concept of this system was it , which was , in the space , <unk> <unk> , to start <unk> <unk> , and even with digital <unk> .
And this is what we did , and if we did it , we &apos;ve got a <unk> .
Well , in the &apos; 90s , we realize that we were in the middle of the North and <unk> -- which we did that business as well as we &apos;ve done this .
And I had this piece of <unk> , which is that these <unk> in the same kind of idea in the same kind of <unk> , and the way that the world should be called <unk> <unk> , which should be called <unk> <unk> , which should be all <unk> . And the <unk> should be .
But those <unk> , all of this is really cool . And and those people in my business , I told you that we were able to do it again .
And so I went through that , and I went through this particular film , which was <unk> .
And when I did it as &quot; <unk> and Julia and Julia , &quot; it was a <unk> of <unk> .
Now , <unk> , but actually , in fact , I wanted to go in the form of physics .
That &apos;s what I did .
That &apos;s the truth . The Studio didn &apos;t know .
And I mean , but by the way I said , &quot; Well , we fly into the <unk> . We film the real <unk> .
We &apos;ve shown it in the video of film .
It &apos;s really cool . It &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
And I <unk> them , a expeditie of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . But this is why this is going to be able to change that experience .
And then we took a little girl in there , and a reality , in which I was in a rivers called <unk> , four kilometers under the surface of the water , and that real Titanic with a <unk> <unk> .
This was not a film , no <unk> .
So that &apos;s really my job .
And those <unk> were huge . We needed camera and <unk> and everything else .
And then I viel in the way , which was a little bit like this : A <unk> .
Yeah , they were <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re going to run in these <unk> , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in the donker , <unk> environment , which is not going to be <unk> , which is not going to be <unk> .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s so as though I was in a <unk> .
That &apos;s really cool . &quot;
I was really obsessed with the <unk> of the <unk> .
Well , by the way , or the way , it was kind of , and he was all . It was all . It was cool , it was motion .
And it was a child , which was me not there .
Because , you know , I was able to imagine a creature that was going to create a visuele impact . But I was not able to look at it , and I was able to look at it as well .
For some of these <unk> <unk> , I was in the same time , and sometimes things that I &apos;ve never seen before was anything that was not even one of the time that nobody had yet ever seen before , and for that as we saw them , there was no words in which we &apos;ve seen before .
That &apos;s me really <unk> , and I wanted to go out .
And so , I did a little bit more difficult .
After the Titanic &quot; Titanic &quot; told me , &quot; Okay , I &apos;d like to do my job as a filmmaker in Hollywood , and I &apos;d like for a little bit of <unk> . &quot;
And then we went , and then we went through these <unk> .
And we went down to &quot; <unk> , &quot; and they went through <unk> .
And we &apos;ve got to get rid of the Titanic <unk> .
So we took little robots that we built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
Our idea was , <unk> , and the <unk> in the middle of the <unk> , was never done before .
No one had to do with the <unk> <unk> . Man didn &apos;t have any tools for it . And so we created the world .
After all , I &apos;d like to put it on the top of the Titanic , and I look at it as a <unk> , which is a little bit like that , and I know that you &apos;ve got a little bit of the piano here .
And I <unk> with a little bit of a little <unk> in that bar .
Now , I &apos;m a little bit of it , but my bewustzijn is in the middle of the state .
And it was as though , as though , as I was living in the middle of the Titanic <unk> .
That was the <unk> form of a <unk> , which I &apos;ve seen . Because before I put a wall in the middle of it , I knew , was in the middle of the middle of the state in the middle of the space , because I took a little bit of the film in the middle of the film .
And the number of the first time was a little <unk> of the <unk> .
This was a really interesting kind of interesting .
So this idea of all the way that you know about this is that you have such <unk> <unk> , and this kind of way in the voertuig , in which the other way in which the other form of life can be <unk> .
It was a really big deal of it .
And then , if you look at a little bit of the time , maybe in a few months , then if you look at it in a few months , and then you have a little bit of the other things , in all kinds of things , which I like , in all sorts of things , which I like to do as a <unk> for me .
After all this <unk> , we &apos;ve seen that we &apos;ve seen it as well as this as we &apos;ve seen this kind of <unk> , which is <unk> , but here &apos;s some of the <unk> .
You live with help .
They don &apos;t exist in a larger space system , which we do .
And so you can see cells , which is direct after a 500 graden Fahrenheit .
<unk> lives . And you can &apos;t imagine that you can have .
And so , in my time , I was very interested in this time , which was getting rid of the time of my childhood .
And so , I ended up with the people who care about the space , and that in the NASA , and at the same time , and the right thing , you go through Rusland , and you go down to the mission for the mission of <unk> <unk> , and then , in the developing world , in the developing world , in order to have the international <unk> and <unk> .
That was fascinerend .
But at the end , it was going to get rid of that , and I was able to put it in that way .
I took them with them , and they had access to the world at the top : <unk> , <unk> , people , who were <unk> for such extreme situaties . I took them to the solution to the solution , and so forth .
And we &apos;ve made it <unk> , but in fact , science , in terms of course , said yes .
So , in the middle of my <unk> , then , as a kind of thing , was kind of like kind of the reality .
And in the course of course , I &apos;d like a lot of <unk> .
I &apos;ve like a lot of science fiction , but I &apos;ve also like a lot of <unk> .
Now if you think about it , you &apos;ve got to get a <unk> , which is a <unk> , or so .
Now , I don &apos;t know , but I &apos;m not going to have a lot of education before I have these <unk> .
Because one particular point was to say , &quot; Well , what are I doing here ?
Why did I do that ? What about this ?
This is a <unk> film , and we don &apos;t get a little .
So we &apos;re playing a little bit of it an . It &apos;s not a little bit of noise .
All the way , I mean , was between &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and then I &apos;d be able to put it in the middle of a <unk> on the strand .
I &apos;ve taken all of these films , for example , for a very small one .
No <unk> , no <unk> , and what does you do ?
You &apos;re going to put it in the way that we want to get to the solution -- and the oceaan is the <unk> environment , which is that it makes it as well as the rare , which is a little bit like a small group of people a team .
Because we &apos;ve taken all over 10 to 12 of 12 people , and they &apos;ve got three to three months to get back to you .
And in this community , in fact , is that the great thing that you have to do with it is that you &apos;ve got a job that you &apos;ve got to get , because of you have an idea of something that you can do .
Now , if you go to land and say , &quot; Well , we needed to do it again , which is the <unk> , and that all the time , and that all the time , and the problem is that , then you can &apos;t explain the other , but then you can &apos;t explain the other .
That &apos;s a link , a little bit of respect .
And when I get out of my next film , my next film , I took a look at the same time , which is that he &apos;s a team of the team , and in the context of everything that makes respect .
And that as that as that as the dynamiek was really changed .
And then I put it again with a small team at the time , and we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology , which was doing for a new technology .
It &apos;s exciting .
It &apos;s a massive uitdaging .
And we &apos;ve gotten for a period of four to a second of four .
And then , as this kind of respect , my kid , was completely .
And there were people who said , &quot; Well , we &apos;ve had these <unk> <unk> and really a little bit of <unk> in the world .
And for me , it was sort of a <unk> Art , and my job is the object , which has changed .
So what are we going to get through all the time ?
So what about this trial we have ?
And I believe , in fact , a second thing is that nieuwsgierigheid .
It &apos;s the absolute human .
Our heart is a power , which can be able to change the reality .
And that <unk> of how many of you have is belangrijker as all of the world .
For me , young man , who says , &quot; Let me give me a comment , which is what I can do . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t say , &quot; <unk> .
That gives you a little bit to you . Don &apos;t get rid of your mind , he &apos;s not safe to get yourself . &quot;
And this NASA has a <unk> : &quot; Really is not a gift . &quot;
But in the arts , and when it &apos;s a feeling of failure , it &apos;s a gift of a single object .
No big business business , which creates a great deal of discovery , you &apos;ve got a lot of the same .
You &apos;ve got to be ready , like this .
That &apos;s the idea that I love with you , and it &apos;s quite a gift , and it &apos;s not a gift , too .
Now , if I want to talk to you a little bit more about this , it &apos;s the amount of data that we eat , and if you eat them , it &apos;s going to be more like that , and in fact , if you look at it as we can use information as we could use data as we can see data as we can see data as well as we see .
So what we see here is a typical <unk> of <unk> .
And the program that I use here is a little experiment .
And it &apos;s called <unk> , and I think , in fact , I can say , in fact , I can say , you know , <unk> .
And then I see a slightly different patroon that makes sense .
And this is what happens when it comes to people in the world , and they &apos;re here in the <unk> .
And we can get a step of a time , and then we have a little bit of data , and then you see that <unk> and cancer that are likely , but not for everybody else .
Now , when we go down , we &apos;re going to say , you know , we &apos;re 40 years old , and he &apos;s going to see 40 years , if you look at it as a result of that , which is all the time that people are worried about it .
And as well as it looks like this , it &apos;s all about these guys .
So you recognize that the status of the data and data in this way , in fact , are in the way that it &apos;s going to remind of it in the way .
And then , if we can do this for <unk> , why not care about content ?
So what we &apos;ve got here is that <unk> of each one &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , who was there .
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s online .
Now , you can look at this stage in your <unk> test .
So , if you look at it , they can go into a decade in a decade .
So you can run in a single event .
So you can put them in a particular component .
Now , if I look at this , I see that with these <unk> , which looks like this kind of <unk> .
I &apos;m a guy named <unk> Armstrong , so I went through all of this , and I &apos;ve got to show you all the time in which <unk> Armstrong said .
Now , now , if I &apos;d like to get one more <unk> , I think , &quot; Okay , what if I &apos;m going to go through all the time , I think , &quot; OK , what about the future ? &quot;
So , I &apos;m going to get a step back again and a little bit of it .
Now look , Sam , I see Sam <unk> .
And so you get a concept of that kind of idea that if you look at this kind of idea of information , it &apos;s a little bit more , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and then you look at it .
So you &apos;re making a little bit of a little bit different .
It &apos;s something inside it , and we think it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able .
Now , I want you to get a little bit of a little bit more wrong with it , sort of right ?
So what we &apos;ve done is , we &apos;ve got a little bit of <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be in a small kind of <unk> .
And that is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a piece of <unk> and a symbool for it .
I &apos;m just going to show you the top of the top 500 of the time .
But in fact , in fact , we can think about this kind of thing .
Now , we &apos;ve got a little bit more than that of those issues , which is about Wikipedia .
So I &apos;m going to ask the term &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Now , by the way I said , &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to recognize that these <unk> , which is the end of the time for Time <unk> .
And this is really important , because it &apos;s really important , which is not in one hand .
This is only to recognize when you get a piece of time .
Now , if you look at this , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of this , and then in the future of Time <unk> , and all of you see in the case , and all of them look at all this time .
Now , if I think all of these individuals are going to be in the world , you know that the meerderheid of the wetenschap . Some of the science here . There is my baas . And here is my Queen . And here is my baas .
And interestingly , Bono &apos;s a TED Prize .
So we can go back and look at all of the TED Prize .
So we look at it , we look at the first time when it &apos;s really a Web , not just from her site , but it &apos;s a little <unk> .
And so I &apos;d like to show you a little verrassing that was a little verrassing .
So here &apos;s just the New York Times website .
Now , <unk> , this idea -- I &apos;m not going to call it a <unk> ; it &apos;s really not a <unk> , but you can look at websites -- and we can look at these <unk> to every single website .
So I can get a step back to a little bit of time , and a little bit of an individual <unk> .
And that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because of all the way in the same way of websites in this Art and the way that it &apos;s all over the world , and looking for these kinds of things that look like .
So I can get in my view , in my view , in my view of an experience .
So here &apos;s the site of the world , which I &apos;ve been for , which I &apos;ve been for .
And I can just look at all of this , and I &apos;ve seen it again , again , <unk> .
And then , as I go back to a space and look at all , I &apos;ve got a look at all of my time , and here , for example , I went through &quot; <unk> , &quot; and here , I &apos;m going to look at &quot; <unk> , &quot; and here , after all of a sudden , here , here &apos;s a <unk> Labs , of here , after Live Labs .
And by here , I can go through that site , and then it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
It &apos;s a metafoor , which is all the time , and every single time it makes the difference as the result of its own .
Now , in the past , in the past , we think data that we have a <unk> .
And we have the reason for the <unk> of the state .
And we have reason to do with the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
So , what , if we look at this particular situation , and the Internet in the face , so that we can start to go through one of the time , start or can begin to go through all of the things , and how do you recognize things that the response was hidden away ?
And if we can do this , then this is a <unk> <unk> , or maybe a new source of information .
And so , in fact , we only have to move into information , and we can get some of them .
And if we have some reason , we can get rid of it as well as we care about it .
So I &apos;ll hear it , thank you .
Well , in the past , you know about the geluk .
Now , I &apos;ve been able to meet a lot of the boeken in the world , which was with &quot; Happiness &quot; in the world in the world in the afgelopen five years , and they were at a time , and there was many more .
Well , it &apos;s a very big golf course of the public health of the world .
It &apos;s really a lot of <unk> .
Everyone would love that people are gelukkiger .
But , ondanks all of this drive , it &apos;s a lot of audio , which it is almost impossible , even though it &apos;s almost impossible .
And my final talk today , though , is this <unk> <unk> .
And this is the moment of <unk> , which is how many of you think about it , and it &apos;s even when it comes to thinking about it , because of all of the things that we have to find out when each other .
This is the first one in the middle of it is a <unk> , <unk> .
And it turns out that the term term is not easy because we want to do it as many different things .
Now , I think , it &apos;s an impact that we could only have been able , but in the Great one , which is something that we should have been able , and we &apos;ve got the complex idea of thinking about it .
And the second thing is that we have a <unk> of experience and geheugen , and you know , in fact , it &apos;s going to be a lot of older in their lives , and having to be gelukkig of their lives .
And this is two very different ideas , and they are both <unk> in the design .
And the derde thing is that <unk> , and that is that <unk> , which is that we have no way of thinking about a particular way of life , which is the importance of meaning .
I mean , that &apos;s a real cognitieve space .
There &apos;s no way to get rid of it .
Now , I &apos;d like to do with a voorbeeld of something called a <unk> , which was a story called one of the time , and there had been a <unk> .
And then there &apos;s one of the time , really , really emotioneel , and that &apos;s really an experience of the past .
But that wasn &apos;t that .
So the way it was <unk> was that it would be .
There was that experience .
There was 20 minuten <unk> love .
She &apos;s not <unk> , because there was a herinnering in the herinnering ; the herinnering was <unk> , and the herinnering was everything , was there , was there was the herinnering to get there .
So what we really think about this is that we &apos;ve been able to think of other people in terms of different people in the end .
Now , it &apos;s a <unk> , which lives in the present time , and that &apos;s the present time , in fact , it &apos;s time in the past , but in fact , in fact , it &apos;s really the present .
It &apos;s the <unk> , which is the arts -- you know , as the arts ask , &quot; Do you know when I &apos;m here ? &quot;
And then he &apos;s a <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> , which is that <unk> and the story of our lives right now , and is the arts , which is the arts <unk> in the way that says , &quot; Who have the arts <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Who was your trip to <unk> ? &quot;
These are two very different <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> , and those <unk> , and those both of the water is part of the time .
Now , the problem is a feminist person .
And it starts really to get a profound way to our herinneringen in the way -- it starts off .
And we don &apos;t really tell you just stories , as we go , verhalen .
We &apos;ve told you our own stories , which is what we want to do with our <unk> .
And let &apos;s start with a voorbeeld of a voorbeeld .
It &apos;s a little bit of the time .
This is real patient , which is a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to go in the detail . You ’ re not nearly pijnlijk , but it was pijnlijk , as this studies in the 90s .
They were asked , all of the 60 seconden about their pijn .
There are two of them . These are their <unk> .
And you &apos;ve been asked , &quot; Wie are both of those ? &quot;
And this is a very simple question .
A second B is really <unk> , and there was a minute , and there was a minute of choice , which was a single person to the patient A , and so forth .
But now he has a different question : &quot; Who are the ones that they believed ? &quot;
And here is a verrassing .
And the verrassing is that patient A has a much more <unk> <unk> of that <unk> as a child .
And those stories of <unk> were different , and because it &apos;s a really <unk> part of the story , which is the story of it .
And none of this story is really <unk> , but it &apos;s one of them -- but one of them is really powerful , but one of them is really powerful as the other .
And that , the worst thing is that the pijn was at the time was at the time at the time . It &apos;s a bad story .
So what are we doing ?
And because we asked these people after they said , &quot; Well , what are the good thing about , &quot; Who was doing all the time ? &quot;
And it was a word for A as A as B in the <unk> .
Now , this is a really kind of a little conflict between the <unk> and the <unk> itself .
By the way , the idea of the <unk> itself was a <unk> time .
Now , in fact , if we could say , and we &apos;ve done clinical trials , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s going to be able to be able to put that <unk> by patient , or to put it in the air , and then you can just put it in the parking lot to you .
That leads to the patient , but only a matter of thing and less as before .
And then , if you have a couple of minutes for a couple of minutes , you know , the <unk> versus the patient is A <unk> , and you &apos;ve got a little bit of the time if he &apos;s a little bit more <unk> , because he has a little bit better to get a little bit better for his experience .
Now , do you see a story ?
And this is the moment of those stories that we care about , and it &apos;s important for those stories , which we create .
Now , it &apos;s a story of <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> are very , very big , very important and in this case .
Now , the <unk> itself live in the past .
It has <unk> the other way of the others .
And you ask , well , what about this point ?
And the answer is really easy . You &apos;ve got to be lost .
I mean , that the most big deal of our life -- and I &apos;ve got the idea of the psychological present for four months . And you know , you know , you know , in fact , in a life of 2,000 , it &apos;s going to be a little bit about it .
Those of them were completely genegeerd by the <unk> .
And yet , if you get to the impression that they &apos;re going to have all the time , and then you have a look at the time when this is our lives .
It &apos;s the taste of the hulpbron , which we are using in the world .
And the way we could make it as important as it is , but it &apos;s not that that &apos;s the story that <unk> for us .
So we have the <unk> , and the <unk> , and they are really quite different .
It &apos;s the biggest difference between them , and it &apos;s the same .
And then , in the sense of the time , if you have a vakantie , which is the next week , which is the next week , which is the first time of doing a little bit less than the <unk> vakantie .
So it doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> .
For example , for example , a video is a little bit of less , but it &apos;s a little bit of better as it is to get a new activity .
It &apos;s not the last story .
And so , in fact , the critical thing is that the critical character , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , and so it has very little impact on this story .
Now , the idea of the power is more , as to tell you , and tell stories .
It &apos;s really <unk> , which is the beslissing , because if you have an individual , which says , you know , in fact , we have two <unk> to say , which is the way that the herinnering is , which is the way that the herinnering is that the herinnering is that the herinnering has .
And the <unk> itself has no stem in the choice .
In fact , we don &apos;t choose between <unk> . We don &apos;t choose between .
And as we think about the future , we think about our future as an experience .
We are thinking about the future , in the future .
And in fact , in fact , if you look at this , you know , you know , as a <unk> of the <unk> , and you can think of it as one , which is the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> zelf .
And I think this is a little bit like that , if we look close to it , we &apos;re going to get vakantie in the service , and we &apos;re doing a little bit more <unk> in the service .
And this is a little bit hard to <unk> .
I mean , who are <unk> , or how are we ?
That is the argument that for that through the design , which is the way that it has .
And when I was thinking about it , I think you &apos;ve seen a little bit of a couple of years in Antarctica , which was really the best trip to you , and I think was pretty much more likely to be in terms of the way , and I think was a little bit more likely .
And I &apos;m sure about my herinneringen of this <unk> trip , I &apos;d like to say about 25 months in the afgelopen four years .
Now , if I opened up the map with 600 shots , I would have spent a new minute .
Well , that &apos;s three weken , and this is a $ 10 .
That seems to be a <unk> .
Now , I want to be a little bit of an idea , you know , in the way , which is how little <unk> I want you to do with it , but if you have a real question that is really a real question . Why is we a real question of weight in the way that we care about it ?
So what I want you to do is that you have to think about it .
So , look at your next vakantie , you know , if you look at it , all of you have all your pictures of all your images , and you get a <unk> medicijn , so that you have a <unk> .
Now , if you pick up the little vakantie ? And if you ask another vakantie , it &apos;s a conflict between you and you have to think of thinking about it , and you really need to think of this conflict , and it &apos;s really not really easy for the sense of time thinking , and as if you think of thinking about time , you might have a different antwoord .
And why we measure the <unk> , which we have a problem is a question that allows us to create a choice between the water .
Now , those are both the same ways of the traditional terms of happiness .
There are two ideas of happiness , which we can use , one of the time .
So what can you ask , who is really the <unk> ?
And then what would you ask , who are having a long time , who are having a long time in the future ?
And they are all -- geluk for <unk> is a fairly complex proces .
So what are those emoties , which can be measured ?
And , in the case , we &apos;re going to have a pretty good idea of thinking about the geluk or the geluk of the time .
Now , when you ask about the geluk , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
It &apos;s not that it &apos;s not a woman .
It &apos;s really , or fun of the kind of fun of the person is thinking about their lives .
<unk> <unk> .
And every one of these questions is not a look like the study of happiness , and I &apos;m a lot of a lot of people in the world , and I &apos;m sure to have a lot of people in the world who have been thinking about it .
And that is the distinction between the geluk and the geluk in the last few years , and then you get into the burden of the afgelopen year , and now you &apos;ve got to do that both <unk> .
And that <unk> has been a global meeting , which is one of a half million people , as one half thousand people are wondering about how they thought about their lives and how they were thinking about their experience .
In the afgelopen year , we &apos;re starting to learn how many of the other ways of trying to learn .
And the reason we have to do is , which we believe , is how they are really different .
Now , you can see , who &apos;s really happy to be there , and that &apos;s really not what &apos;s really interesting about it , and vice versa , it &apos;s going to be alive .
Just to give you a little bit of a difference between the relationship , which is a lot of <unk> .
So what that means is that if you were a person , and you would say , oh , my dad is a <unk> , who would like , who would you know about it ?
Now , you might know about it , but it &apos;s a lot of tension .
So you have such a kind of <unk> .
Now , if I tell you that somebody &apos;s life like eight to 10 <unk> , you &apos;ve got a lot of tension over there , and you have a little bit more interesting about it .
It &apos;s really small .
Now we know something about it , and we really need the better for the time .
We weten that the money is really important , really important .
And we know about it , and we really need to be happy with people , which we &apos;re willing to want to spend time with people , which we love .
There &apos;s other fun , but it &apos;s dominant .
Now , if you want to take care of both the time , you want to be able to be able to do a different kind of different things .
And the conclusion that I said to you , is that we &apos;ve really had a really good way of doing that as a kind of <unk> .
It &apos;s a completely different term .
Now , in fact , a lot of the idea that we don &apos;t believe about geluk is that we &apos;re not going to look at all of those things when we think about the life as we live in .
Now , if you ask the simple question , you know , who people in California are not going to have the <unk> .
Now , if you ask the question , you know , that those people in California are more likely to be in Africa .
And what &apos;s happened is that if you look at it in California , you think about it in California , you think about the difference between California and other places , and this kind of difference .
Well , it turns out , and it &apos;s not really important for the <unk> , and it &apos;s not really important for the <unk> , which is a little bit more important for you .
Well , because of the <unk> , you can get to the end of the time -- some people might look at it by California .
And it &apos;s interesting when it comes to people , which is kind of <unk> , which goes to <unk> , gelukkiger .
Now , the <unk> itself is not gelukkiger .
We know that .
But one thing is , but you &apos;ve been thinking about it , because they are gelukkiger , because when they think about it , it &apos;s all the time in Ohio in Ohio . And they feel , you know , that the juiste decision would be .
It &apos;s really hard , but I hope , and I hope , I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of it .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you .
Now , if we were a few weken geleden , you &apos;d say , you know , it was a very interesting time , which was a really interesting thing about this <unk> trial .
Is that one thing , which you can do , because you have a couple of months over here ?
Daniel <unk> : Yeah .
And I think this is a matter of <unk> , which we &apos;ve discovered in the <unk> , which is a number of thing that we don &apos;t expect .
And we found that in the context of the time , at the heart of the time .
Now , as we look at it , you know , you know , you know , the nature of the food industry .
And it turns out , if you look down to a inkomen of 60,000 dollars in the year , and this is a very big scale of American , which is a very big divergence of polio , but it &apos;s a very , very typical example in the dollars of underground $ .
CA : 60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60.000 dollars in this year , people are crazy , and they have more <unk> , you have <unk> them .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do with it .
I mean , I &apos;ve seen it so that <unk> lijnen .
So what happens , is it &apos;s obvious that it &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s really a little bit of the time for a lot of the time <unk> , and we can have this <unk> .
And in the sense of the rest , or the <unk> , you get another story .
You spend more and more money you get .
That &apos;s not true for emotie .
CA : But Danny , in the past , in the past in the world , for free , the search for <unk> .
Now , when people get rid of this <unk> , I mean , it &apos;s all the time in the face , which we believe , in terms of the way we believe in terms of <unk> and so forth .
Now , are there a chance of that time , which is a chance of the time that land in the West , which was a really <unk> way of thinking about it ?
<unk> : Well , I believe , I believe , you know , it &apos;s going to be part of that matter in the politiek industry .
And it &apos;s going to be in the United States , in the United States , but in the U.K . , but in the U.K . , in the U.K . , in other places , in the past .
And those people are doing this , recognize , thinking about geluk , as they think about politiek .
It &apos;s a long time , and those people are <unk> , and they have to look at it as they begin to explore , and we &apos;ve really got to explore this debat .
Now , if you get a great deal , it &apos;s very different from how you think and how to think of the <unk> <unk> , or if you think about it .
It &apos;s natural , but I believe in the next few years .
And in the United States , in the United States , in the case of the population .
And this is what I like , in the next one , in the next one , in the next one , of the national data .
CA : Well , it seems like this onderwerp , or perhaps , if you &apos;ve been thinking about it , you know , the next time you have over the next few years .
Thank you very much for the first one .
Thank you , Danny <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to talk to you about the power and the West .
And this is thought about something like that , because of the stichting for the stichting , in which we have been able to do all the time , which is all the things that we create , which we need to create the armste two to a better life .
But the energy and the West are very important for these people , even more importantly , but even more importantly to each other in the world .
<unk> means that those <unk> are not going to be <unk> by many years , and we have too much of the time , and those things are really different , and those things are really different .
This leads to <unk> . It &apos;s going to be <unk> .
So it &apos;s a <unk> for them .
And the reason is that it &apos;s really important for them .
And it &apos;s that , as though , is that , if you could use only one of the cost of the cost , which was the most powerful .
Now , it &apos;s a little bit about the time that kind of <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s called the <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> , the industriële revolutie that we have in the 20ste eeuw and in the 20ste eeuw , was a <unk> sentence in <unk> , and therefore we &apos;ve done modern materials , and so many things .
So we &apos;ve got to put it in a pretty great context , in which you have in the world .
But then , as we get to the cost of the cost -- let &apos;s take the cost of -- we &apos;re going to meet up with a new <unk> , and this is going to be a <unk> .
So carbon dioxide <unk> the planeten , and that is pretty much the obvious thing .
You know , if you look at the top speed of carbon , you &apos;ve got a little bit of an impact , which has a very negatieve impact on the back , and then it turns out to the weather , which is the end of the ocean , which is <unk> <unk> as well as the natuurlijke ecosystemen of the natural world .
Now , the way we think is that we have a little bit different , and the way it &apos;s going to be <unk> , and where they have all the time , there &apos;s some <unk> , but not very many .
And it has to be <unk> over there , who are fine , but they &apos;ve got very bad .
I &apos;d like to ask you a couple of questions : &quot; Do we have really been able to go down to zero ?
Now , don &apos;t they get the helft of the same ? &quot;
And the solution is , which is , when we go close to nul , it &apos;s going to be further .
So it &apos;s a very big uitdaging .
It &apos;s a little bit different to say , and we &apos;ve got a <unk> truck , which is one of three feet in front of a three feet .
And this is going to get to zero .
Now , we &apos;ve been flying through a $ <unk> <unk> of 26 miljard ton .
Well , there &apos;s a $ 20 ton of water , people out of poor land , as one .
It costs about five ton of each of each of you in the world .
And we should be able to create the impact , which is the economy .
It &apos;s getting constant rise .
It &apos;s only a lot of economic impact in the world , and we &apos;ve got to be able to increase the speed of carbon dioxide , and to a supply economy .
Now , this is about four factoren . It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> . You &apos;ve got this idea of the left -- you know -- CO2 -- that &apos;s the number of people in which you get to the surface of the human population , which is the equivalent of the people in the equivalent of every single person , which is the equivalent of the power of every single person , which is the equivalent of all the time .
So let &apos;s look at all this kind of thing , and we look at the same kind of thing , which we have to .
It &apos;s probably going to get a look in a very close line .
Now that &apos;s sort of <unk> , but we &apos;re going to get rid of it .
So we &apos;ve got that .
Now , today , we live for <unk> million people .
And it turns out , and it goes to 9 miljard <unk> to move to nine .
Now , if we really have a good job with the information , which we have to do with 10 percent , we might be able to see 10 percent to 15 percent , but we &apos;re going to see a <unk> .
The tweede thing is that the service that we use .
This is all the food , which we eat , kleren , TV , <unk> .
And it &apos;s very good , and it means that the service almost every one of each time , each of each of each of them has to do .
It &apos;s kind of cool .
And in the rijke world , in the top of the top , we can get rid of the top of the top , but in fact , in the gemiddeld size , each year , each year , and then , in fact , in fact , it &apos;s going to be more efficient , which is the size of the service that you have .
So here we have a very <unk> service , and if you see that , and then you can see that huiswerk , you can read that huiswerk ?
And they don &apos;t have these students , and they go out and read about it as well .
Now , in efficiency , the E , the power of power , he &apos;s going to have a good time .
And we have something that &apos;s not going to do .
And by the way , it turns out to be a lot of <unk> , through other <unk> , through the information , which is a lot of service , as well as you can get to <unk> as well as it can be <unk> , <unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
Some of them have taken by 90 percent .
And in other words , as the flow of <unk> , 105 feet : <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , is the <unk> of <unk> , and it &apos;s really a big deal .
All right now , if we are optimistic about it , we &apos;ve got a little bit of a factor three , or maybe a particular deal of a single time .
But in the first three organisms , we &apos;ve now become 26 miljard to have 13 miljard tons of almost 13 miljard ton .
So we look at the same kind of figure -- and this is a <unk> -- that &apos;s the amount of CO2 , which is a lot of CO2 , which is the size of the water .
And the question is that the question is that if you can get to zero .
If you kill the kolen , &quot; No .
If you kill aardgas : &quot; No .
All of all the time , you know , almost all of the water for you today , you know , carbon dioxide , you know , the carbon dioxide and it <unk> .
So what we need for a global level , is , is , in fact , a new system .
And we &apos;ve got to have <unk> .
Now , as I term the term term &quot; wonder , &quot; my mind isn &apos;t the onmogelijke .
This is a sad wonder . The computer is a wonder .
So the Internet and the service is a wonder .
And those people here have been here in the developing world .
Of course , it &apos;s not <unk> that you have a wonder to have a wonder to one particular conference .
Well , you know , you know , it &apos;s just even random , or others , others .
And in this case , we &apos;ve got a little bit of <unk> and a wonder in a very short time .
Now , I wonder , who can be really <unk> ?
Is it a natural gas , which is a <unk> , which is the idea of people here ?
I remember at the end of the time , if I was eating , and I was able to do that .
It &apos;s the concept of it that was really <unk> , and you know , you know , the people who live in .
For the way of power , this is one .
And I decided that the idea that was <unk> by my <unk> , in the environment here .
So here &apos;s some natural <unk> .
You &apos;ve got me <unk> , and they don &apos;t have any sense of time .
Now , it &apos;s all sorts of <unk> who , but they don &apos;t care about it .
And we need the solution , and then , of course , a couple of those <unk> , and maybe it &apos;s going to be a lot of <unk> , and as though , it &apos;s going to be only five , which is really going to be able to do all this big <unk> .
I &apos;ve got <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Now , this kind of money might mean , and if they save better as I verwacht , it &apos;s kind of cool , but my <unk> here is this , and we can &apos;t even get rid of the way that we need for , because all of them have <unk> problems .
So let &apos;s look at first in the European industry , in terms of greenhouse gases or gas .
Now , what you &apos;ve got to do is , maybe it &apos;s not . Man needed to do all the CO2 in the air , which is going to go through the air , and then there &apos;s going to be anywhere in the air , and we &apos;re going to have anywhere in the same time .
Now , there &apos;s a couple of <unk> , which is that in a 60 percent -- 80 percent , but it &apos;s really hard to get into 100 percent . And it &apos;s really a big uitdaging .
Wie did it ?
Wie can &apos;t be able , and if you can grow a lot of thousands of thousands of thousands of years as a matter of air , and others can imagine ?
It &apos;s a big volume .
That &apos;s a really hard time .
And then , in the next decade .
That &apos;s got three very big problems . And that cost of all in the time , in fact , in fact , in fact , in order to get rid of the future , which is really going to be able to get rid of the human <unk> , which is not going to be able to use the private sector , which is not the brandstof for sustainability .
And then you put it in the air ?
Because it &apos;s not very big , it &apos;s a lot of interest .
And those people really need a lot of people , and 10 : 10 to 10 : 20,000 -- 10 : 8 : 10 : 25.000 , so that might be <unk> .
So , three very hard issues , which may be <unk> , and how they should be .
And I &apos;ve got that number three to the five .
It &apos;s those <unk> , which they &apos;ve got to be used .
And they have -- as though , it &apos;s kind of cool , but they &apos;ve got a couple of alternatives .
Now , one is that these <unk> , which is dramatic , which is dramatic cost as that of <unk> .
This is <unk> , you know , or you know , or you know , if you look at it by many <unk> , it &apos;s more <unk> .
And so we &apos;ve got some kind of <unk> .
And the Sun doesn &apos;t seem to have the past , but it &apos;s not all of the day , and so it &apos;s not going to be the wind .
And then you need to get rid of the solution , which is a way that you have to do as well as if you are not available .
So here &apos;s a lot of <unk> here . There &apos;s a lot of <unk> . And as we say , you know , that the source of the state outside of the land , you have not just the technology , you have to do with the risico , you should be able to do with the better change .
And it &apos;s the <unk> .
And then , to show that we all the way that I &apos;d like to show you all of the same way of <unk> , which was called , in fact , and computer , computer , computer , <unk> , for all of the electronic power , which has to be using the size of the world , which has to be in terms of the world as well as the world that we could grow .
So here we have a great doorbraak , which is something that 100 as 100 as a factor of 100 to the time .
That &apos;s not necessarily , but it &apos;s not so easy .
And this is what happens when we want to say , if you want to say , you know , 20 percent -- 30 percent of the water .
Now , if you want to get to 100 percent , you &apos;ve got a really <unk> .
Now , where are we going to go to the right ?
A &quot; Manhattan project , &quot; and how are we going to step up ?
So what we need is a lot of companies that have been working for .
In each one of the five areas , we &apos;ve got to have 100 people .
And if you were to say , it &apos;s absurd ! It &apos;s good .
And I believe , here in the TED group , he has a lot of them .
And Bill <unk> has many companies , among others , which is a called <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , in many ways , in many ways , are really interesting and interesting ways , and so interesting , and I &apos;m going to help .
Nathan <unk> , and I was able to do a business model , which was the case of <unk> <unk> .
Well , it &apos;s a lot of discovery in it , <unk> , <unk> .
And this is not a big verrassing for this project for a long time , and it &apos;s not really a great verrassing that a lot of the same ideas .
And the reason for that is that , in fact , in fact , is that in the context of the water , which is one percent , which is a percent of the top of the water , which is <unk> .
This is a pretty cool concept .
But you &apos;ve been thinking about long before , but you couldn &apos;t do anything <unk> , but since then , it &apos;s going to be modern <unk> , and then you see that : Yes !
And because of this 99 percent , it &apos;s really a lot of better .
And in fact , if you do it , and you can do it as well as a matter of technology , as it uses as a <unk> .
So , in the way , in the face of your mind , you would be drinking it .
And then it &apos;s going to be used as well as a matter of one .
And you see that it &apos;s kind of <unk> as a &quot; <unk> . &quot;
That &apos;s really what it lost .
Here &apos;s an image in Kentucky .
This is the temperature , which is 99 percent . You &apos;ve got the kind of water , which is the same kind of <unk> .
And this is what the U.S. economy of the United States for .
And then , if you go to <unk> and it &apos;s easy , you get enough brandstof for the rest of the world .
Now , you know , it &apos;s a lot of uitdagingen , but it &apos;s one example of a couple of different parts , which we need for years to go .
So let &apos;s look at how we should be done .
Who should we look like this ?
Now , we go down to the line , which we have to do , and then we praten over the <unk> .
It &apos;s about a 80 percent by 2050 , by 2050 .
It &apos;s really important that we have to reach .
For the good 20 percent in the poor country , and then we have a little <unk> . All right , we have a little <unk> .
So , for example , about 80 percent , you &apos;ve got to get rid of the water , including China , which is how China is completely <unk> .
And the other speakers says , &quot; You know , of course , we &apos;ve been able to engage with these <unk> in all <unk> , and we have to get to the rest of the rest .
That &apos;s cool .
And that &apos;s what happens to be a <unk> .
Now , if we look at it , we could look at it before we could look at this before ?
It &apos;s going back to those two <unk> .
And we should use those <unk> , and you have less to help . You &apos;re less than getting rid of it , and so it &apos;s going to be the temperatuur of the temperatuur .
But in fact , this number for those things that we do , which we are doing , which is not the big <unk> , which is even more important to that other than that other , which is the other , which is the other , which is the other way of creating the discovery that creates the discovery .
Now , we &apos;ve got these <unk> , and this is what we can do : in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of great boeken over here .
This Al Gore , &quot; We &apos;ve got the choice &quot; and David <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
You &apos;re going to go through it and create a frame , in which this building material , because we need to have access to all of the sites .
There &apos;s a lot of a lot of it .
That &apos;s a wens .
It &apos;s a really good idea that we design this technology .
Now , if you go through the next 50 years , I could say the president would take the president , and it &apos;s like I could say , &quot; Oh , if I could say , &quot; Hey , it &apos;s going to be a little bit like that , <unk> <unk> .
This has that highest impact .
Now , if we &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of a long time , between the long time , at the same time , and at the same time , between the United States and China , between the United States and almost all the lives of all the time , all of the rest of the world are not nearly a half .
So what should we do ?
So for those things ?
We need more <unk> for more <unk> .
Now , if there is no way in the place , in fact , in the same way , if they don &apos;t want to talk about CO2 .
You &apos;d be able to take this <unk> and you &apos;d like to get rid of a little bit of the word &quot; <unk> &quot; for these <unk> <unk> .
And we need to have more <unk> , carbon <unk> , which is something called <unk> .
We need the message to the message .
And we &apos;ve got to live with , and <unk> , and those things that we &apos;ve done , which is the same way that we have .
It &apos;s a really good success , but I believe , we can run .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you very much . Just to understand a little bit more complex -- <unk> , can you have a concept of scale ?
Bill Gates : Well , for those simulatie , we &apos;ve taken all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done for some kind of 10 miljoen . And even if we test our materialen in a Russische world , you know , in fact , in fact , it &apos;s going to work in the <unk> of <unk> , in fact , in fact , in the <unk> .
And the hard time , the space is building the world , and there &apos;s another billion of the time , which is that the first one in the world .
And by the way that the world is done , as soon as soon as soon as soon as it is , all the way it &apos;s really important is it &apos;s different as it is as different as we know them .
CA : And really , really , really , really the way that it means , in fact , in the air , in the air , and then , in the middle of the blue <unk> <unk> , and then it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the time right now and how does it start ?
BG : All right . Well , you &apos;ve got the <unk> <unk> , and so it &apos;s a lot of people and a lot of <unk> , and so many of the things that you can do , and that &apos;s not really good .
Now , if you &apos;ve got a really sustainable restaurant , you can get it for 60 years -- you think of a <unk> -- you know , you know , without all those <unk> .
And it &apos;s going down , and then , for 60 years , it &apos;s done .
CA : A <unk> , which is the solution to the air .
BG : Yeah . Now , he &apos;s going to put it down ; you can get it down -- it &apos;s a lot of air with this procedure -- then you get it and put it in the next time , in the next time , in the next time .
And we start by , by the way we go through the air , which has been done in these <unk> , and this is our <unk> .
And this is what we found was a problem that we were in our water , and this is what we see in our water , and so it was the way that we were making .
CA : Well , while you &apos;ve seen with different people around the world for these ideas .
So what is the highest interest in that ?
BG : Well , we &apos;ve got a little bit of the time , and there &apos;s a lot more interesting to it , and there &apos;s a lot more interesting to all the &quot; <unk> &quot; in the <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of interest and the people in Rusland , and there was the world , and there was the <unk> of the people in the world .
Now , I &apos;m optimistic . Well , you know , the Fransen and I have some of the same time in that direction .
This is one of the things that was done .
And this is a larger space , but it &apos;s a little bit more sophisticated , and there &apos;s a couple of countries that are built , and there &apos;s one of the world , which is a <unk> for our first time .
CA : Well , in your mind : How many of you have ever been able to get into life ?
BG : Well , we &apos;ve got to have one of these <unk> , which are really goedkoop , and then we &apos;ve got 20 years to <unk> , and then 20 years to <unk> .
And this is why it &apos;s going to be <unk> , which we &apos;ve got to do with it .
Now , you know , you know , <unk> , and that &apos;s a big wens , and that &apos;s a big wens , which is the opposite .
And fortunately , there &apos;s actually hundreds of companies , and we &apos;ve got hundreds of companies , which , as though , as they work , as they work , in order to work for their <unk> , for example , <unk> .
And it would be the best , as though , if it could use a tool .
And for every case we need a solution .
CA : Well , <unk> the big deal with it is that you know ?
BG : A <unk> is that <unk> .
Now , it would be without that <unk> , but it makes the power of it .
In terms of <unk> , there &apos;s other innovatieve companies .
You know , we don &apos;t know the job as well as this , but it &apos;s a little bit like that , but it &apos;s a different approach .
Well , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is a little bit hard , but you know that it is about us .
Now , it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s a little bit like that , and it &apos;s a little bit like that , and then you have a little bit more energy than one , and so , as you know , as you can do with the problems , and then , as you know , as a result of the problem , and that , it makes sense that the impact in the world and the cost of the cost , in fact , is that the impact the impact in the land and other things
CA : Well , if not , was ?
Do we have <unk> <unk> , looking at the same time , making it <unk> ?
BG : Well , if you go in the context , it &apos;s like a lot of sex , and even a little bit of a free .
Well , it &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s called <unk> , which is that , in fact , with different technieken , in order to do that as we get 20 , 20 , 30 or 30 years .
It &apos;s just a <unk> .
So the hope that we don &apos;t need is that .
Some people say , &quot; Hey , you don &apos;t even want to engage with the <unk> for you , and you know , you know , if you want to eat , you know that one of those <unk> .
Now , I don &apos;t know if the smart is , if you look at that point of view of this technology , it &apos;s going to be a discussie in the way that you have to have to do as well as if you go to those things , as a matter of discovery , if we expect .
CA : <unk> : Have you ever put it in the same way that you might ask ?
BG : Well , the leader live in a lot of <unk> .
Well , by the way , all of the evidence , it &apos;s very weinig .
Do they say that it &apos;s an negatieve impact , which is going to do with the wolken ?
Well , it &apos;s very , very few things that they can say to you , or they can say , of course , which is a chance of a thousand .
This is something like this , net like AIDS .
So you are doing the Type , and you get paid a lot later .
And so that concept , in fact , is that if you have all sorts of <unk> <unk> , in which you have been a little bit later -- and this is why it &apos;s not going to be <unk> . In fact , it &apos;s not the destruction scenario , and there &apos;s people in the rijke world , and there &apos;s people in the rijke world , which is <unk> .
And that &apos;s why this is how we are really concerned about it .
Now , my dream here is that , as though , is that , if you can see it , and then it says , &quot; Okay , it &apos;s really hard to say , &quot; Okay , it &apos;s not because it &apos;s going to be more CO2 , but I &apos;d like it to say , because it &apos;s the time that it does , but I &apos;m going to say , because it &apos;s more difficult for those <unk> . &quot;
CA : And this is the answer to the TED argument , which is that , if you use all this time , and if you use all of this time , all those other questions , you know all those other questions , which is the other people , which is a jazz verspilling , which is a jazz verspilling of food , and so forth , if you can .
BG : Well , that &apos;s the real amount of time for that research -- you know , we have 10 to 10 miljard per year , if they &apos;re doing today -- it &apos;s not so dramatic .
Again , the other things should not lead to others .
And then you get to a big <unk> , and here can &apos;t be <unk> people , which is not economic , and so on .
It &apos;s a really hard time , and I &apos;m really a little bit of a <unk> , and I think we should have more things that have the potential , which is making the potential , which is a lot of <unk> .
So if you get rid of it , it &apos;s a very fast <unk> , but it can only be able to do it as well .
I mean , every one of us could have been able to change the power of our power without changing their lives .
For the bottom two , it &apos;s a ramp .
And then <unk> thinking about it .
And he &apos;s going to be asked , &quot; Well , why does this experiment look like this research ? &quot;
There &apos;s always , because there &apos;s a lot of stories , in fact , in the middle of the past , but there &apos;s a really <unk> team , but there &apos;s actually a very <unk> species , and therefore it &apos;s going to be right now .
And this is a <unk> , which I &apos;m for .
And that research , it &apos;s really absurd , which is the way it has .
CA : Bill , I believe , I &apos;m going to talk to you all the people here , and I really hope that you are a kid . Thank you very much .
BG : Thank you .
And I &apos;d like to tell you about a few maanden later a few maanden later a little bit of the word for the king Wired magazine .
I &apos;ve always been a little bit of schrijven , but I was at the time , and I was at the same time , and then I viel later , in my life , which was the term &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;m a little bit of the term .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to get a friend &apos;s friend named <unk> , and he was really <unk> , but I was able to say , &quot; <unk> , &quot; but I was able to read more <unk> , and he was able to read , and he had to read , and he was <unk> , and so on the way , and so on .
And yes , it was a <unk> , old <unk> , and I thought , &quot; Well , there &apos;s a little .
And , in fact , it was a revolution at the time when I was at the age of the storm , and so I began to create my <unk> outside of my <unk> <unk> , and then , in terms , in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
And God was very , very hard for me .
So , as I think about this piece of design , I was born in a world , which is one of the person who thinks in the future , and so , for example , for the future , and I &apos;m going to be able to do for the better time .
And so I went through that <unk> by 2009 , and I thought there was a <unk> toy .
Here is the <unk> version of this .
<unk> is not a lot of better .
And it &apos;s a little bit of <unk> <unk> by &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; by &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot;
But it &apos;s not just about those words .
It &apos;s the way we think about those people , which we describe with these words .
It &apos;s about those rules , which are in the words in the words , and who we have a second .
Now , we have the idea of our thinking and how we see the world and those people around us .
Now , many <unk> , as well , as those of the Grieken , and the <unk> , in fact , was really believed that they &apos;ve had a big power of a great power , because there was a very big power , because there was a man in the form .
So what are we going to do with this kind of <unk> of a human rights ?
And in fact , if you look at a human <unk> as kind of like kind of <unk> , they could have <unk> , and they <unk> .
And then if it &apos;s not beautiful , and you put it back ?
One of the man , which was for me , is my job for <unk> . <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> .
There is Dr . <unk> . A <unk> , which says you can &apos;t correct the American American <unk> . And then there &apos;s always Dr . <unk> <unk> .
And Dr . <unk> used to be a little <unk> of <unk> , and was for that time , was kind of <unk> .
And I was the time , which I spent in this ziekenhuis , and it &apos;s kind of cool -- until I was in my head .
Now , I was a little bit of a little bit more different than this kind of <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in different words -- which knows about my computer , and I &apos;d like to get rid of my <unk> , and I &apos;d love it again . I did it .
And imagine , if you look at it as a <unk> kind of kind of <unk> <unk> and so on , so why did you have a little bit more <unk> .
And one day , there &apos;s been a little bit of an experience -- and this is a little bit of <unk> and <unk> -- and there &apos;s been like me , &quot; Wow , you know , &quot; Oh , Aimee , and a half of young baby , and young baby , and young baby .
And then , as you know , I &apos;m going to give you $ 100 . &quot;
And this is just a little bit of a simple sentence or Dr . <unk> , and so I couldn &apos;t even say that by the way I couldn &apos;t do with the time , and there was me in the same way that there was working with the second time in the second in the second , and so there was a new and more interesting kind of <unk> .
And I wonder , who was the way that his vision of me as a lot of me and a half of a young baby , and I was able to imagine as a matter of nature , and I was able to see that as a matter of the nature of <unk> and <unk> .
This is only one example of many , or for example , for example , in the words of the arts that you have .
But who used to be a little bit of <unk> examples of the <unk> , which allows us to imagine is something that we &apos;ve been thinking about all of us , but all of us would be able to put together as a human .
Now , the same thought of the maatschappelijke impact in many ways , which was in many cases , were in many different ways .
For example , if you look at this , or you can say , you know , my benen , which is the <unk> for <unk> , which is <unk> from Titan , which allows you to have all of the time , and in fact , all of the way people in the world , all the way people in order is to use all of their ideas , and then , in fact , all the way that you have to have a different identiteit , which is how they have a single kind of social solution
And so , and so forth , in order to have a group of <unk> , which is the same .
Now , the technological challenge for this technology makes sense , is that it has to be a different truth , which is that one of the people in which we have a little bit of <unk> and very <unk> , and it can change the human ability , which is changing our own .
And this is a really interesting idea , and this is a interesting story , because people me have been trying to tell me more about it , and I &apos;m going to say something like that , and I &apos;d like to say something like me , and I &apos;m a little bit more difficult for me to answer the questions for people , and I believe , in fact , why .
This is a lot of the deal with the impact on the way that was the concept of the concept of happiness , which was the way that it was for me to get rid of the way that was kind of <unk> , and if my life was so successful , because I was able to change the way that was kind of <unk> in the world , because I was able to figure out the kind of <unk> in the world as well as people with me .
But the truth is that we change . Well , we tend to change the uitdaging , it &apos;s really emotioneel , emotioneel .
And I &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good .
<unk> are not <unk> , which we need to do with our lives as well as a result of our lives .
<unk> of our own lives .
And I &apos;m involved with it as my schaduw .
And so sometimes I want it to be very close with it , and it &apos;s not really there , but there &apos;s always been there .
And I want to get rid of the impact the impact as well as the nervous system of a human .
There &apos;s a lot of real time , and for uitdagingen , and that is just a little bit of real real real time , but the question is , but the question is , but the question is that we &apos;re going to get rid of the question , but we &apos;re able to figure out who we get .
So we are not just responsible for the people we love , which we love with <unk> , but it &apos;s really cool to you .
And we tend to do our kids not feel a little bit like that , if we can &apos;t change it .
You &apos;ve got two different things out of the way that one of the time you believe in the future , and to the others , which is the most important one in which I &apos;d like .
And in order to be true , which is the fact that the only idea of the <unk> , which I &apos;m going to do was , is that the world &apos;s way , and they can see me , in the world , they could see me with these <unk> .
And in our sense , those people , who are the people , which are us in the hart , and they really need the <unk> , which is the hard truth of their medische responsibility , which you might expect to ask , is that we should be able to figure out the way that it is .
Now , the idea is that <unk> concept , which is the only time in the water , and who we can fix it , for each one of each time , for each of us , for every single one of us .
Now , if we don &apos;t do a human rights , and not all of its networks and then we recognize them by the natural conflict , which then we need to get rid of the natural conflict , which you might have .
And we have a human society , which is one of our patients .
So , we &apos;ve got to go through those <unk> , and we really need to focus on the human .
Now , if you look at it , it &apos;s the way that it is between the perception of the mind , and we &apos;ve got some kind of connection .
And we should not be able to do this <unk> , <unk> , we should not be able to <unk> , and we should not even get rid of the back , but it &apos;s in the future of the future .
And the reason for me is that we &apos;ve always been able to get rid of the way that we have more <unk> , but we &apos;ve got to put it in the way that we care about it , in order to put it in order to put it in order to even get rid of a <unk> , and maybe even with it .
And then we can change it as well as a result of natural gas , and it makes sense , and then we feel that if we are not so much about it .
So , in this year , we &apos;ve been watching 200 of Charles Darwin , and if there was 150 years ago , in my hand , Darwin , in my hand , in which it was a little <unk> in the human nature .
And I &apos;d like that in the case of the world , not the highest of its own , and it &apos;s not the <unk> , but the way that the impact of the mind could be the best .
And so for conflict , creativiteit becomes power .
Not only from Darwin &apos;s way of course we know that the ability of people , in the way that the ability of human nature depends on the human mind , and it &apos;s really natural .
And so , let &apos;s get a look , and creative people are the largest ones .
And perhaps you know , we &apos;re only going to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> as we &apos;ve done .
Well , it &apos;s really the notion of <unk> , or a sense of <unk> , it &apos;s a sense of how it &apos;s possible for our own power .
So we can get something like that .
And we can change a new quality of the better time , which is about a long time .
Now we can be able to see <unk> as a change .
<unk> for a future , which we &apos;ve done is that we have no way .
And I believe , the highest failure , which we have to believe is to believe that we are normal .
All right -- wie is normal ?
There &apos;s no <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s <unk> . That &apos;s the <unk> . But wouldn &apos;t it be that the poor , authentic person really <unk> you know ?
I think about it .
Now , it &apos;s kind of cool , if we look at this model of the future , if you look at it , you know , it might be a little bit dangerous . And so we can change those <unk> , and so we can get them all the way that it &apos;s very difficult for us to do with it .
And so many of the things that we found is that we &apos;ve got people by the group of our patients , in order to have a choice of choice , and a toy .
Well , it turns out that many years ago , for example , for example , were oudere people and humans , and people have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to do that <unk> in the world for the first time .
They don &apos;t care about this as it was <unk> and <unk> , and they were treated as something special and <unk> .
For a few years ago , I went down in the stad , in which I was in a &quot; Red Zone &quot; in the &quot; Red Zone in the West , &quot; and there was a <unk> <unk> .
It was zomer , and I had <unk> .
And I remember , who said , &quot; Well , after a man says , &quot; Well , after not Aimee <unk> . &quot;
And I went down and see this male man . I had no idea of how there is .
And I say &quot; sorry , Sir , sir , you know ? I can &apos;t remember . &quot;
And there he said , &quot; Well , yeah , you &apos;ve never thought about it .
If I looked at the first time , I &apos;d like to put it out .
Oh , so .
And yes , it has to be <unk> .
And this was Dr . <unk> , a man , which I was telling of , was a little bit of the day for this day , because I was a little week later , in my birthday , two weken later .
And the arts for <unk> <unk> was my moeder in vakantie , and the man kende the man , which was the man , which was me in the world , was not .
And because I was born without <unk> , and my feet came to them , and I just got a few notes at this and a few notes on the other voet of the other voet of the time that was good enough to do the good time .
And I said to me , &quot; I mean , I needed your husband to say that you never go back , and have never been able to <unk> as other kids , and you have never been able to have a living life , and then you have me going to have been <unk> . &quot;
And quite quite was that there was a lot of <unk> in the next time , and it made me a little bit of the time in the second grade in the second grade , as I was at the age of <unk> when I was in the middle of my time when I was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and there was a lot of the time for the time of the <unk> Medical School and the <unk> Medical School .
And there &apos;s this sort of thing over the motor of the X issue , the power of human nature .
And you can &apos;t just say enough , which is the importance of this factor for a human .
And Dr . <unk> , he said , &quot; Well , I &apos;d like , &quot; I &apos;ve been taught that kind of , if they get a little bit more different than they said , and if you get a little bit better , you can get a little bit better . &quot;
You see , Dr . <unk> has changed .
There was a lot of the time that train help , and who was making , two different things .
And so , as I realized , in the loop of the time , when they were , as they had me when they had me 15 years ago , as I was , of course , to go out of time , and then I &apos;d have a little <unk> for vlees of vlees and <unk> .
I wanted to work as well as the normal .
Now , if you ask me , I don &apos;t know .
And this is what happens , when I was doing something with my benen and not <unk> the experience .
And perhaps the idea of all this happen , I &apos;d like to do this for many people , which I &apos;m going to put in a lot of people , for example , in the people , in the people , who wanted me to come with me , and they wanted to be a concept of idea of mine .
Now , look , it &apos;s really only one of the people , you know , you &apos;re going to show you how you can <unk> your krachten , and you have .
Now , if you allow it to put it in a way that you have to put your own , <unk> <unk> -- the human nature is so <unk> -- as if you open it , and for a second in a second , then you have a very good kind of time open .
You can bring them down , in order to open up .
And the essence of the problem is &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> in the term &quot; <unk> . &quot;
It means something , which is that , in fact , is making the potential .
And again , how do we want to do with the future ?
In the &apos; 60s , in the U.K . , in the U.K . , there was <unk> in <unk> .
You call it &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the United States , in the United States .
And those students are going to be able to separate them .
And those A <unk> <unk> has been a little bit more efficient , they get more <unk> .
You know , you know about a <unk> , and they said , &quot; There &apos;s a &quot; <unk> &quot; and they said , &quot; Well , they said , &quot; Well , they said , they were <unk> that they were really <unk> . And before they were really <unk> .
And the reason for this is to hear a really hard one in the way that he was going to say , vice versa .
And even though it was after three maanden .
But only the way people were in the school , though , for the school , which was the school of school .
And the reason for this trial was , is that those <unk> were not <unk> .
And those <unk> didn &apos;t figure out that something was veranderd .
And you &apos;ve got to say that these were <unk> and that , and that &apos;s the students in the trials , and they &apos;ve treated them as well as they type .
And the fact that the only experience is a human nature , which was completely <unk> , has no hope . There is nothing more <unk> in the way that we do with the natural world , <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
Now , as we go through the human spirit , we continue to get into the human spirit , and other people are really beautiful , rather than part of the time , and then we are really really a little .
Now , as a sense of character , we can have a new realiteit , and then we can create a new reality of the future .
I want to finish with a gedicht , which is one of a <unk> , which is called &quot; My friend <unk> &quot; and my friend &apos;s friend <unk> , and the gedicht heet &quot; The God , &quot; and that &apos;s one kind of kind of friend <unk> . &quot;
Come with me , please . Thank you .
