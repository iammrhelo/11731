A couple of years ago , here at TED , Peter <unk> was a <unk> called &quot; The <unk> . &quot;
It &apos;s pretty easy . <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> with 20 <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and a marshmallow machine .
The marshmallow is supposed to be quite <unk> .
And , although , it &apos;s really <unk> , it &apos;s really <unk> , because they &apos;re <unk> very quickly .
And so I thought , well , that &apos;s an interesting idee and I made it into a <unk> form .
It was a massive fortune .
Well , I &apos;ve been working around 70 <unk> over time , with <unk> , <unk> and architecten , <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s something that was <unk> <unk> in that environment , and I &apos;m going to share with you a little <unk> in that environment and I &apos;m going to share with you some of that .
<unk> the most people are <unk> to <unk> .
You know , they figure out , they figure out , you know , they &apos;re <unk> .
And then you spend a little bit of a little bit of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
And you spend a lot of them in that <unk> in that <unk> range of <unk> centers .
And finally , even after that , even after they have no time , someone who does the marshmallow , and they put it down to that top of it , come up to a step and <unk> .
But again , it turns down , it &apos;s going to be <unk> to a <unk> , which is the <unk> , because the gewicht of <unk> , that that &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
There is a set of people , who are <unk> <unk> like other people like other <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You get liegen , they <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
And they were <unk> team that <unk> <unk> , and they were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s pretty amazing .
Who told us from Peter , it &apos;s not just that <unk> <unk> , but that single single <unk> of all of all .
And you might be wondering , well , what does that happen ?
And Peter tells me , &quot; <unk> the children in the morning stop <unk> <unk> . &quot;
You spend not in <unk> .
But there &apos;s another question .
And that was that <unk> <unk> are getting a good plan , right ?
And then it comes to .
And then what happens when they were the marshmallow on that lower <unk> , they have no more <unk> and what was happening ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
Klinkt , right ?
The other thing that <unk> differently is that they start with the marshmallow and create prototypes , but they have <unk> the marshmallow on the top of the <unk> , which is that they have <unk> <unk> prototypes .
<unk> recognize this kind of <unk> as a <unk> <unk> .
And then , with all kinds of <unk> , there was immediately feedback feedback and was <unk> .
So that &apos;s the amount of time , with prototypes of <unk> -- but we see , who are different team <unk> .
And the average is the average of the most <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that there are a little bit more , not much more , but it &apos;s not really <unk> .
So , how much is it ?
So architecten and ingenieurs , I think .
<unk> is the <unk> , which was I saw .
And so why ? Because they &apos;re <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> the power to create <unk> structuren .
The CEO lie about average , but this is interesting .
You see , <unk> <unk> <unk> on the team , they were <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> . You see , &quot; This team is <unk> . &quot;
You can see it . Why ?
Because they have to <unk> that <unk> .
You create that trial , they get it .
And so that team , it turns out that , and that &apos;s <unk> and on that kind of <unk> that &apos;s worth spreading .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their <unk> are developing .
When you think about 10 teams , which is typical , you &apos;ve got a <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
I have a little <unk> .
I thought , well , we made that <unk> .
So , bone , I was a <unk> <unk> a <unk> device .
So , what do you think about that <unk> ?
What was it ?
This is what he did . Not a team of that .
As <unk> <unk> had built a <unk> machine , there was going to be <unk> .
Is it not interesting that <unk> has a tremendous effect ?
We <unk> this <unk> <unk> .
What do you think ?
Well , you know , that &apos;s why &quot; <unk> . &quot;
So , in fact , <unk> , the <unk> team of that kind of thing .
You see <unk> that &apos;s <unk> in the lower time .
And so there are <unk> lessen for us , over that nature of motor and cause .
And you might say , &quot; Well , why were someone going to invest in a <unk> ?
And that is , I <unk> digital tools and <unk> , to help team , <unk> , video games and <unk> <unk> .
And that was <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re able to make that <unk> <unk> .
Because , right , every project , every single project has happened .
And that really is a common experience , which is a common sense of <unk> <unk> , which is to build the right prototype .
And that &apos;s what that is that kind of <unk> , this is <unk> .
And those of you who are interested in <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s an blog , where you look at that <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
So , you know , I &apos;m going to find <unk> examples of all over the world , who are <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> .
And that basic lesson , I think , is that there &apos;s an <unk> sport .
And so it &apos;s <unk> that we focus all our way to that task , and that we think that we have the <unk> <unk> , who makes our <unk> and <unk> .
And again , a little prototype of that kind of experience , everything that was going to be done , from a <unk> , we have to <unk> from a &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And that could make a big difference .
Thank you very much .
And when we were here , we did a machine , right ?
A large machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that &apos;s a <unk> machine .
And everybody in that <unk> .
And you can do that in that moment , you can go in that future , you can &apos;t be able to go and down .
And I &apos;d like to ask you , well , because I would ask you , because I was going to give my friends over .
I didn &apos;t know . I &apos;d like to go back to that day , for that moment , for cars , from Twitter to <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know .
I know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
And I snap .
I &apos;m not part of this , I think .
I don &apos;t want that moment , and it &apos;s not because I &apos;m not , because I &apos;m not , because I &apos;m a <unk> -- because I &apos;m not here .
It &apos;s not that easy to go to that planet , they &apos;re going to go further .
I &apos;m going to put in this machine , and I &apos;m going to go into that <unk> .
This is the <unk> time that you were looking at this planet , which is the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , mobiliteit , <unk> <unk> .
But he didn &apos;t have a moment to this .
My <unk> were killing everybody as they were 60 .
My <unk> <unk> this number of <unk> to <unk> .
My ouders are in <unk> <unk> .
So I &apos;d like to give you a little bit of a second to me in the beginning of my <unk> .
But it &apos;s not just to us , because that &apos;s a little bit like that .
So , a young boy in <unk> born in <unk> , which is going to live long enough to live in 100 years .
Think about it . It &apos;s a terrible way .
And so why is that ?
The pokken . The pokken , in the <unk> , were killed up .
You see that <unk> of Earth were <unk> , who didn &apos;t get a <unk> .
They &apos;re gone . They &apos;re <unk> .
We have <unk> . <unk> .
In fact , in the rijke wereld , in the other world , they were <unk> for only a generatie of us , but they &apos;re not <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
Did anybody think that was that ?
<unk> , modern medicine , our ability to <unk> , miljarden people are living in our <unk> <unk> .
And so , from my view , that molecular <unk> , <unk> to me , of course , is to figure out , to understand , when it does , that &apos;s not what it does .
That &apos;s the good nieuws .
But I think it &apos;s all a good nieuws , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve got a few other problems .
And one of them is , in fact , that ondanks all of our lives in this world , a half of our lives in that world every day .
This is the length of it , and it comes down .
And not just that , we &apos;ve been able to use our <unk> , this world <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> land , <unk> , <unk> , gas , <unk> , <unk> , and then that we were not going to move from that chaos , we were not going to move from that chaos .
So that question is : Can we do that ? I think so .
I think that &apos;s <unk> that we can create <unk> , which is <unk> that land will be <unk> that land , they live .
I think we have to <unk> that world with <unk> , they don &apos;t have to change that .
I think it &apos;s really , and it &apos;s not <unk> .
But that &apos;s at night -- one of the things that I &apos;m sitting at night , which is at night , I think at night , and we don &apos;t think so so much that we have a lot of that , but we still have a lot of that .
And we were able to have no <unk> , and we were <unk> .
We have to be <unk> , wonderful events in many days , and I think , but I think we have a lot of time to go to that .
The other thing that people <unk> in their mind , and so scary that you can not make it .
Not sure that it comes to <unk> .
And then , you know , everybody has a Recht at its point , actually , in fact , that &apos;s a pretty good point to <unk> .
But you know , you know , what you didn &apos;t have ?
You don &apos;t have to <unk> your hand . &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t have .
And I took a time to deal .
So about 10 years ago , I was writing a paper called The New Yorker magazine , a little paper .
And I was <unk> , to <unk> , <unk> , by the way , that was the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of human history .
I didn &apos;t know , I &apos;d be sure , so I &apos;d be sure that I was <unk> , and I &apos;d be more like that .
And he was looking for a paper called <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And those things , once again .
They were <unk> .
And so I was writing about a paper , and I couldn &apos;t understand why they thought , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they were geloofden that there was a little bit of a little <unk> <unk> in that area .
But you know , I was <unk> . I was writing that paper , and I was <unk> .
I mean , I was journalist .
We &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re going to eat .
But this artikel made me , and I couldn &apos;t figure out , and I couldn &apos;t figure it out .
And that &apos;s what I think that was <unk> that I &apos;m not <unk> a little <unk> .
They were <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> people .
They were net who in this room .
And that &apos;s what I did .
But then , I thought , well , well , so you know , that &apos;s what we are .
We &apos;ve been waiting for a moment that we don &apos;t have to <unk> that way that we were <unk> .
We need <unk> .
And we have reason for that , with little <unk> , which is <unk> .
Okay , well , I think , well , and I think we think about that .
We believe in <unk> , in the autoriteit , and in the other hand lost a lot of that , and they don &apos;t need that .
You know , you can just call a couple of <unk> and those people .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , those <unk> 2000 .
I mean , you can , you know , you can take their hand .
It &apos;s <unk> and <unk> that we geloofden that they were <unk> . You know , they were <unk> .
And so you ask questions , desire to prove that desire .
You don &apos;t think anything like it .
But then , you know , when you think that you can &apos;t think that &apos;s really important to think that it &apos;s really <unk> , and it &apos;s not good .
And I can tell you that we &apos;ve been able to say that we live in a set of <unk> , who I &apos;ve never seen before and hope .
So about 12 years ago , a story published published , a <unk> story , which was <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> studies were doing a little <unk> .
<unk> studies were going to be <unk> ; that &apos;s a great deal .
Those of you who were <unk> .
And that data from the U.S . , from England , from Zweden , from Canada , from Canada , and they were all the way , not a combination of connection , not .
It doesn &apos;t make sense . It doesn &apos;t make sense , because we think that we think , we think , was that we think , was that we think , was that we think , was that we &apos;re really <unk> .
We don &apos;t think like a <unk> documenten from an <unk> that we have data , and I snap it , I think , that &apos;s what we do .
But you know ?
The <unk> was <unk> .
<unk> roads , which is the United States there is one of the only countries in the world , in that <unk> <unk> .
This is <unk> , and we should be embarrassed .
It &apos;s <unk> .
And that &apos;s what we did .
Well , I snap . I &apos;m doing that .
So , does this happen to be <unk> ?
Did you think a single person in the audience , you know , you know ?
Not very often .
In this country , in this country , in the last year , was <unk> for the last year .
They &apos;ve been <unk> by <unk> , 20 per months .
But because this is not true here , then we can see it , and people who are <unk> , and people who are <unk> <unk> and <unk> from <unk> and <unk> and Larry King <unk> .
And they can do that , because they don &apos;t connect and <unk> .
You know , they don &apos;t know that these things are <unk> , but it &apos;s not that <unk> .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to learn , and that &apos;s really .
This was a <unk> , Jonas <unk> .
There are some of our <unk> <unk> of human <unk> .
Don &apos;t fear , not <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The guy in the end , it doesn &apos;t .
There is Paul <unk> .
There is just a couple of people who have developed some of a <unk> .
There is life from <unk> , 500,000 children per year in ontwikkelingslanden .
Pretty good , right ?
And that &apos;s good , at least , that Paul <unk> and writing about vaccins and writing , who makes them , and that those people are <unk> to <unk> .
And that &apos;s what it says .
Paul is <unk> .
In a <unk> <unk> , there doesn &apos;t have to be <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s an <unk> <unk> , because they tell me to tell you that they know where the kids were <unk> .
And why ? Because Paul was a vaccine have done .
I don &apos;t have to say , but <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , you know , they are <unk> that were <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
In this country , we have <unk> .
And it becomes worse , and very soon they were <unk> , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
And they were not only <unk> .
<unk> ? <unk> ?
A couple of weeks ago , I was writing a few weken later , and she was a little bit more <unk> .
Nobody has to say that .
She &apos;d not be <unk> .
<unk> .
Why ? Because we were not <unk> .
In this country , we were not <unk> .
Today , I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m going to get a couple of days from here in Lagos , and I ’ m going to go to Los Angeles in a vliegtuig , right ?
And in a few hours , there are <unk> a <unk> , and there comes to Long Beach , and there &apos;s one that &apos;s going to go to visit a <unk> <unk> .
And there doesn &apos;t know that there is a <unk> ziekte of cancer , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s not , because so that &apos;s going to be the world .
This is the planet , we live to live .
We love to <unk> .
Do you have a ochtend of all the <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> , you know , a little <unk> that you &apos;re working on that <unk> .
I know , you know , you know , that you &apos;ve done that , because that &apos;s the helft of the Americans that make a <unk> .
You know , you take that stuff , and they take alternative <unk> , and it does not make a difference , and they figure out that they &apos;re <unk> .
Those of you that are <unk> that are <unk> .
You <unk> your urine , you can &apos;t get it fast .
This is okay , you know , you &apos;d like 28 miljard dollars for <unk> .
I &apos;m not .
<unk> urine . Dark .
Why are we doing that ?
Well , I don &apos;t understand , we haten that <unk> .
We haten a high school , and we don &apos;t believe in the system .
And that &apos;s not that we were not . Our <unk> are <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to miljoenen people .
It &apos;s absolutely amazing <unk> and <unk> to us that could be able to afford themselves .
So we get to get away , and where do we go ?
We go to the poor of <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> . I love that <unk> .
But , you know , that &apos;s a good <unk> , because that &apos;s <unk> , and we give miljarden dollars for it .
And I made all the different <unk> here .
<unk> -- <unk> , entertainment , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And you know , you know , when I say , you know , I &apos;d say that , like , you know , they say , &quot; What does it leave ? &quot;
So they feel good . &quot;
And you know , you were <unk> .
Because it does , of course , of the <unk> is saying , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m going to say that , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m going to say that , &quot; Hmm , I don &apos;t think it should be <unk> , &quot; or any other <unk> are going to be <unk> .
And then , when you go to this journey , where belief is an <unk> and magic , and you go to a place where you &apos;re not .
You &apos;ve got to <unk> <unk> <unk> in Zuid-Afrika .
There was 400,000 people around there , because there was that white <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> as <unk> <unk> drugs , that we could know that they could know that .
<unk> <unk> in a country in a country , it was worse than any other people who were <unk> .
And please don &apos;t ask me that these things have not .
They &apos;ve got them . They were .
The <unk> epidemie that we are at the top of that <unk> conflict is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s an <unk> discussie . You have to stop .
It &apos;s an discussie over words , over beeldspraak .
This is ideologie , not science .
Everything was we eat , every <unk> , all the <unk> <unk> , all of the <unk> , from people &apos;s <unk> .
You know , he wasn &apos;t <unk> in the paradijs .
It wasn &apos;t <unk> . It wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We &apos;ve made it in the last year .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
We were <unk> , it wasn &apos;t working .
Now , we can do it more . And they are <unk> . But we can do something like vitamine A in <unk> , and that stuff that stuff needs to be miljoenen people , and they live in many ways .
Do you want to do that ?
I don &apos;t need to say that I snap .
We see <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Why are we doing that ?
And so , I was a little bit of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;d not be <unk> .
We don &apos;t want that country <unk> .
We don &apos;t want that <unk> .
And you know , what my dad is doing all that ?
Yes , you have right . <unk> .
It &apos;s true , we have a massive <unk> , but it &apos;s not science .
It doesn &apos;t have to do that .
It &apos;s right , moral , <unk> .
You know , you know , that &apos;s not <unk> .
It &apos;s not land .
It &apos;s not a sense ; it &apos;s a <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> , and it doesn &apos;t have no <unk> , but that we &apos;d be able to allow that to do that .
And in the next 50 years , we &apos;ve been able to get 70 percent of each other in that moment . 70 percent .
This is in Africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
You &apos;ve got that , and we don &apos;t give them to .
And <unk> ? <unk> .
We don &apos;t want to encourage people to <unk> that <unk> stuff , who are <unk> .
<unk> is a half miljard <unk> .
It &apos;s like a <unk> .
It &apos;s just a <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> .
It didn &apos;t have tons of money , it doesn &apos;t have that eiwit , and wetenschappers are doing that .
And then those people were eating and would not be blind .
You were not <unk> , and you know ?
It would be nice . It wasn &apos;t <unk> <unk> , but it was nice .
All I could say is , well , why are we from that ?
I mean , are we going to ask us ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> a lot of <unk> ?
It &apos;s not about <unk> , Gene <unk> , it &apos;s not about chemicals .
It &apos;s not about our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , our <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not for Rice <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> in life , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
You know ?
If we don &apos;t do that , then , when we get to that , then we get to get a little bit of guilty of that , we don &apos;t get guilty of it , high-tech <unk> .
There is no other beschrijving for that .
It &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s not <unk> , and we have to be doing that .
In this sense , I &apos;d like to say , &quot; You can say , &quot; Look at that , you can say , &quot; Look at that , you know , &quot; Look at that <unk> <unk> and <unk> in that <unk> <unk> in that ? &quot;
In every case , I &apos;m going to figure out .
At the moment , they &apos;re in the ground , but we have a <unk> .
We can do that <unk> to everything we want .
We can <unk> them , where we are <unk> , and we were able to move to where we are .
We have to go to that gesprekken , and we have to think , but when we go into that <unk> , we &apos;re going to have to go and go into that <unk> .
I know that we have to be able to figure out , and it &apos;s what that is what the world is doing .
Thank you . Thank you .
When Steve <unk> , <unk> from Los Angeles Times , a day of moving through that <unk> in Los Angeles , there was a wonderful music .
She was like a man , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which was just two <unk> , which was just two <unk> .
So many of you who were told that story , because of <unk> paper was later a book that came to <unk> , with Robert <unk> <unk> as Steve <unk> and Jamie <unk> as <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> in his <unk> .
<unk> received <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and 30 years later in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of Los Angeles .
I can tell you all of you to read , <unk> boek , and looking at that film , you know , that &apos;s not just being able to understand that beautiful band from these two guys , but it &apos;s also , who , who are <unk> that <unk> with the <unk> , and who are able to get that instrument that <unk> , <unk> <unk> from the road , <unk> <unk> away from the street .
I photographed Mr. <unk> in 2008 , for two years , in <unk> <unk> Hall .
There was just a show of <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and I made it back to me .
There was a very <unk> <unk> and <unk> , Hillary Clinton Clinton and Hillary Clinton who had never made that <unk> World <unk> , and that everything that was <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we were to talk to him to talk to music . And a few days later , I &apos;d get a email , which was that <unk> for <unk> .
I think that <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , because there was already <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , who has been able to participate in that entire life .
And so that &apos;s really <unk> for that <unk> <unk> <unk> . Those are so <unk> that they <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of his <unk> .
And so in that kind of <unk> <unk> , if we were <unk> with the <unk> Disney <unk> in the <unk> Disney <unk> , there was this <unk> <unk> in his <unk> and <unk> .
There was a little bit about onzichtbare <unk> and rook , and , who , who wanted to <unk> in <unk> .
I was bang , not <unk> , but I was bang that I could be able to make sure that there was a little <unk> to <unk> , and I &apos;d be able to figure out what was going to be <unk> and <unk> and other <unk> and other <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
So I started <unk> .
I &apos;d put that first message from <unk> <unk> .
And when I were in <unk> , I realized that in <unk> , in <unk> <unk> .
It was like there were some of a <unk> <unk> , which was a chemical <unk> , which was that <unk> my game was .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in understanding , in a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
And who was a wonder , and there was a wonder of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and bat , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And so we started talking to over muziek , we were starting from a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and all those other <unk> , from <unk> <unk> .
And I realized that there was no more <unk> learning about muziek , but it was just a scary personal <unk> .
I talked to them by a <unk> and a sense , and I think I &apos;d be sure of my <unk> in that <unk> of Los Angeles .
In fact , <unk> and <unk> , was about this <unk> , <unk> man , <unk> man , <unk> from Los Angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> .
Muziek is <unk> . Muziek is being <unk> .
I mean , for <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
Because that music allows him to do and <unk> with <unk> and creativiteit in a <unk> <unk> .
And so <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I think that &apos;s true that that &apos;s true that that &apos;s true of art .
That &apos;s the question , which is because we &apos;re doing something , we think , in all , in all , in all , in all , in that sense , our gevoelens , through our <unk> lens , through our creativiteit , through our creativiteit to <unk> .
And that &apos;s the truth that &apos;s <unk> us all the time , and moving , and our <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> , which was to put it into a <unk> of friends .
The <unk> power of music was to put it into a family from muzikanten , which was that his talent was <unk> and <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> Disney <unk> , of <unk> <unk> Hall , because it makes me sure that there &apos;s me going to be <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Thank you . Thank you .
Robert <unk> .
Robert <unk> : I &apos;d like to play a little bit of <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m all very <unk> .
I love Jane <unk> , I <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> for 10 years of <unk> , and my job for that is to make it as easy to make the world in the reality of life , which is to help in <unk> <unk> .
I have a plan for that . I &apos;d like to give you a lot of people , and I have to share with you all , more and more <unk> games .
We spend three billion hours per week <unk> .
Some of you may be thinking , &quot; Well , this is a lot of time for spellen . &quot;
And maybe a lot of times , when you think of that , when you think about who we think that many problems are really <unk> in the invisible world .
But , in fact , in the lab , I think it was <unk> to that of the future , it &apos;s the opposite <unk> .
And three billion hours per week are not <unk> enough to solve that <unk> problems in the world .
In fact , I think , when we know that , when we &apos;ve been able to make the next eeuw to this planet , I think we have to make that <unk> .
I &apos;ve allowed that that that has been <unk> for 21 billion hours a week ago .
And so it comes to something that is a little <unk> , so I get it to work that , when we think that , when we think that , when we were living , you know , <unk> , armoede , global warming , global warming and <unk> problems , I think , I think , I think , have to work , I think we need to deal with , we need to work .
To put it to the end of the next <unk> , I don &apos;t think so .
Why ? Well , this image , right ?
So why I think that games are so <unk> that <unk> for the survival of mankind in the future .
This is a <unk> of fotograaf <unk> <unk> .
There was a little <unk> in <unk> , and there was one hand called the <unk> a camera .
This is an example of the klassieke <unk> of play .
If you don &apos;t have a choice , you may be a <unk> of <unk> in that picture .
And you can see this gevoel of <unk> , which is a little bit bang , but <unk> focus , but <unk> <unk> in that <unk> <unk> .
And when you look at that , you see some <unk> here , looking at the top of <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> are some of that <unk> .
This is a <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Oh , you know , you know , you know . OK . Great .
So we have some of that .
A <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , which is so <unk> that you didn &apos;t know about that .
It was a <unk> that was happening . And when you get it , you &apos;d get it to you , you know , that &apos;s <unk> .
You know , you can do something that could be done in that .
This one hand is at a <unk> end .
And this is , in fact , that we &apos;ve been looking at a lot of <unk> in the world of <unk> over the world , when we &apos;re going to take that solution to the next 20th century , and the face of all the <unk> in front of us .
Well , really , that &apos;s exactly what we see in real life in real life , when we go hard .
I <unk> it like that , in life , I &apos;m not <unk> .
And it &apos;s my gezicht , right ? Yeah ? OK .
I &apos;m like , who I &apos;m saying , &quot; In life , I &apos;m not <unk> . &quot;
This is a <unk> in Berkeley in Berkeley , California , where I <unk> in my <unk> <unk> that we are <unk> in our <unk> .
It &apos;s a problem that &apos;s a big <unk> .
We think that we &apos;re not really good at that reality .
And I don &apos;t even give you a little <unk> , although it &apos;s done .
And we get <unk> in <unk> .
I mean , I mean , in context , when I think that &apos;s <unk> , a little <unk> <unk> , with <unk> .
And when we &apos;re in a <unk> , I think many of us in our best <unk> , at least , we &apos;re going to go to <unk> and immediately <unk> , <unk> the problem to solve the <unk> process and so long enough to go to <unk> .
And in the reality , when we fail , when we &apos;re <unk> , we feel quite differently .
We get <unk> . We &apos;re feeling <unk> . We &apos;re getting bedreigd , maybe <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The gevoelens of that , we don &apos;t have to play games , but it &apos;s not just <unk> .
And that &apos;s what I wanted to look like <unk> .
Why is it just to be thinking , well , no , you might be able to do anything ?
Who can we be able to figure out that , in that sense , in that reality ?
So , I know , I know , who are World of World of Warcraft , which is that the ideal capital that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I found a couple of things , which is <unk> <unk> in <unk> so .
So , first of all , when you go into one of these <unk> , first of you in World of Warcraft , there are a lot of other personages , who are willing to <unk> you a <unk> mission , and that &apos;s immediately .
But not just a single mission , it &apos;s a mission , but an Mission , that &apos;s perfect to present to your current level , right ?
So you get it .
You &apos;d never get a <unk> that you can &apos;t solve .
But always , you know , we need to give you a side of you , you have to move .
But they don &apos;t exist in World of Warcraft or Warcraft . You don &apos;t have to move around and turn it into something to do that .
And there are <unk> <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to come to you , many , many people , that are <unk> with you , and you get to work with your <unk> success .
It &apos;s not just that we were able to do that , in real sense , that kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so there is this phenomenal story , which is this <unk> story , which is why we &apos;ve got and we &apos;ve got that , and then we can do that .
You know , they &apos;ve got a level of level &quot; level &quot; and &quot; + is one word , &quot; is written by <unk> .
This <unk> response is not in real life .
When I leave this podium , I &apos;m not sure , plus 1 <unk> and + 1 <unk> idee , + 20 <unk> .
I &apos;m not in real life in real time .
So , the problem of <unk> who is World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so <unk> , at least , at the end of the <unk> <unk> , we &apos;d be able to <unk> our entire time in that <unk> .
They are really <unk> like that .
In fact , there are all the World of <unk> <unk> <unk> million years to put together , and that &apos;s virtual problems of <unk> .
It &apos;s not something that is a little <unk> .
It may sound sound .
But to look at this in context : <unk> miljoenen years ago , we started first <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The first <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Okay , so when we spend over and over again , we spend a lot of time with games , it makes sense , when you think about that time , when you put that time in that place , it &apos;s been very <unk> for that .
But it turns out , well , it turns out that we &apos;ve been able to figure out that we use that entire time to play that entire time , which is that what we can do as humans .
We develop <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
That &apos;s the truth . I think I think .
And to look at this interesting video that recently was that recent University of Carnegie Mellon University was called the average young people in a country met large <unk> <unk> 10,000 <unk> <unk> 10,000 hours of <unk> .
And so , 10,000 minutes is a really interesting number of interesting number of two redenen .
So first of all , in the <unk> , <unk> hours that <unk> <unk> that they spend at school , from the <unk> School of <unk> -- when we were not yet .
<unk> , looking at the young people who are learning , was that a <unk> person , who was <unk> , who was in school .
And I think some of you have a new book from Malcolm <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the theorie of that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the theorie of that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ? &quot;
And so it is <unk> to <unk> <unk> that , when we were 10,000 hours with the <unk> College of <unk> , we were able to live <unk> into the beginning of <unk> .
So we were able to get so good enough , which was to <unk> , who was that most of those people in the world .
So , what we &apos;ve been here is a <unk> of young people who are <unk> .
And that big question is : &quot; Do you think <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Because when we were to figure out that , then we &apos;d be able to <unk> that we didn &apos;t have any more <unk> <unk> .
So many people in the world are in the world , which are at least a few minutes per dag .
This is our <unk> <unk> . 500 million people , which is extremely good at that .
And in the next decade , we have to have a new factor , which was extremely good in that .
If you haven &apos;t heard that .
And that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the speed of <unk> and <unk> , but in order to deal with the <unk> in the past world , especially in India , China , <unk> online .
I mean , you would have been a extra worth worth of 10 billion dollars .
And that &apos;s going to have a half a million <unk> .
So , so I started to figure out , well , what was this is , in fact , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done to do this .
Here &apos;s the four things that I found . I think <unk> .
Okay , so you can think of that as extreme <unk> .
<unk> is to say to me , to do something to do that , to <unk> a cliff , put together to believe that we have a <unk> lot of life .
I think it &apos;s not that you think that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
You don &apos;t sit around .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I think there is a lot more interesting studies that we &apos;d like to think of , of course , when we play that , then we &apos;d be <unk> , but when they were <unk> .
There is a lot of brain needs to play a lot of brain <unk> .
And so we &apos;re teaching him that somebody has been <unk> that those <unk> are <unk> that we have to <unk> that .
So that allows us to create <unk> <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> .
And so as a result , we were <unk> social relaties .
<unk> soap . Fantastic !
You know , there is a question , which is a question of <unk> or <unk> 22 hours per week , like <unk> .
The other thing is that , when we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re really concerned , hard to make , if we don &apos;t .
We know that we are as a human being living in the <unk> , when we were hard , significant <unk> .
<unk> are always ready , hard to do that .
Finally , <unk> meaning .
<unk> , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s an <unk> , to get it into straight light , and you know , all of the Wikipedia , which is the biggest <unk> of the world .
The <unk> <unk> in the world , with fast 80,000 <unk> is the World of Warcraft <unk> .
Five thousand people are doing it every single day .
You know , you have been able to figure out about World of Warcraft in the Internet , like about anything else in every other <unk> in the world .
She created a <unk> story .
She created a <unk> source of that World of Warcraft .
Okay , so that &apos;s four <unk> , which one does have to go . <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s people who think that they think that they can be <unk> the world .
And the only problem is that they think , they can do that virtual werelden , but not that real .
This is the problem that I &apos;m going to go to <unk> .
Edward <unk> is a <unk> .
It &apos;s amazing . There are a lot of things .
People spend a lot of time , <unk> and money in <unk> .
And there says , &quot; Well , we were <unk> by not less than a <unk> in virtuele werelden and <unk> . &quot;
And that &apos;s one of a <unk> .
And you say , well , no , so I &apos;m not like that , I <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> .
And so there is actually a sense of <unk> , because choice can be <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
You can see <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as in real life , and you might be able to get more feedback and beloning in <unk> .
And so , there is actually quite a lot of <unk> in that virtual world as well as in real time .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
But it &apos;s absolutely not <unk> .
We have to start doing that real world in a game form .
My <unk> comes from a <unk> , which is 2,500 years of <unk> .
This is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So this amazing <unk> was <unk> .
And that &apos;s what the first was that people were <unk> , and when you were talking to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , that &apos;s what I think of that story . That tells you that story .
Laut <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in dem <unk> <unk> .
And so he was a big <unk> , which was that the koning of <unk> was that the koning of <unk> came up .
Those of those people were <unk> . They were <unk> .
It was an extreme <unk> , and you needed a <unk> .
So they published , by <unk> , that <unk> and <unk> a national act . A to a day , a little kid , you &apos;d be going to play .
And they were doing so much in that <unk> <unk> , there are so amazing that <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , that they &apos;re still <unk> .
And then , you know , the next day , the next to you . And the next to you .
And by doing that , they were doing so much for 18 years long enough to <unk> that they were eating a little <unk> and <unk> .
And so , I think , in fact , we have a lot of that today .
We have to create <unk> , to be the <unk> world of real life , and we <unk> games , and yet to do that in real world , everything in real life is not <unk> .
But that doesn &apos;t have to be there .
This is <unk> .
Laut <unk> von 18 <unk> , die in <unk> lebten , war <unk> . So was die Koning , die letzten <unk> <unk> waren .
You know , they <unk> it in two <unk> .
They were played a <unk> , and that <unk> were <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
She &apos;d come back to <unk> and put it on that particular home , and you &apos;d put it back so many people , who were able to figure out where it were eating , and they were looking for the rest of the rest , in which they were able to <unk> .
It &apos;s crazy , right ?
But the <unk> <unk> shows that those <unk> that <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> , which is both DNA who <unk> that old <unk> .
And so some scientists have recently found that <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> , it was really important to be a global <unk> , 20 years , and that was 20 years ago .
And so , I could get that crazy story .
In fact , they may be <unk> people &apos;s lives by <unk> 18 years of <unk> , and then <unk> and so forth and so forth and so forth and so forth , that this <unk> has been <unk> that the entire <unk> were <unk> .
So , we can do that .
And we &apos;re now in 1994 today .
This was the first <unk> in real time .
The World War or <unk> was 16 years .
You were working at 18 years of <unk> , we &apos;d be a 16 <unk> of Warcraft .
I think we &apos;re <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
And so , they sent that half a half of them in that search for a new world . And so I would get my 21 billion <unk> per week .
And we &apos;d be able to <unk> that that has a half of us per dag to play a little bit of <unk> to play that problem .
I mean , you &apos;ve got to say , &quot; Well , that &apos;s where we are problems of real .
<unk> ? &quot; And so this is what I &apos;ve done my job in the next 20 years to create the back to that future .
So we did this <unk> in our kantoor in <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that we &apos;d be able to figure out who we were doing that future .
And we &apos;re not going to go to you , we &apos;re going to go to think that we &apos;re going to go back to it .
That &apos;s what we want to do , is that we &apos;re going to make that future .
We &apos;re going to show you that kind of <unk> , and then people get <unk> , this concept of that .
So we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> and give people that <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show you three games , that I designed , I designed to address that <unk> <unk> <unk> in your own future .
This is &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The game has been 2007 .
It &apos;s a <unk> that you have a <unk> bridge .
And that <unk> is uitgevonden , but we have enough <unk> , and it &apos;s not that you &apos;re going to live in the real life , and then you have to be able to do that , when you go to <unk> , you can see where you are <unk> , and then you &apos;ll give you a <unk> in real time , which is <unk> <unk> , and then you have to be <unk> .
And who are <unk> <unk> , <unk> are <unk> , and you have to figure out , and you need to figure out how to make the real life , when it was true . And we just ask you to <unk> , video games , video games .
We have this game called <unk> <unk> in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been working on that number of three years .
And I can tell you , it was an <unk> experience .
Nobody else is going to be able to figure out , because it &apos;s good for that environment , it &apos;s good for us .
But if you were to <unk> a <unk> avonturen and say , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to be <unk> . &quot;
It &apos;s a great <unk> , right ?
You know , you know , who are going to be <unk> , who are the most of our <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
And so we &apos;ve got to give you a new <unk> , we spend a very <unk> process of giving birth to <unk> .
And we &apos;ve got that game called &quot; <unk> , &quot; the <unk> for that future .
And that &apos;s starting to figure out that there &apos;s some <unk> that people were just 23 years on the planet .
This <unk> is called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> of choice is <unk> , we have to <unk> who are <unk> <unk> .
You know , Jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> &quot; . You &apos;ve got those meetings , you know , that wetenschappers are <unk> , and they can <unk> that world .
But in our game , in case of just five people , we say , everybody is in <unk> , and it &apos;s our <unk> , that we are looking for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and that we are looking at social rechtvaardigheid and the future of social rechtvaardigheid .
8,000 brothers played a game of 8 weken long .
You know , you know , 500 deeply <unk> , you know , when you can <unk> , you can <unk> <unk> .
The final piece of game we &apos;ve got to put three maart . It &apos;s a game with the Wereldbank .
And then , when you leave that game , you get from the Wereldbank , you get from the Wereldbank , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to have to deal with universiteiten of <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We have a strip of that . We &apos;ve got &quot; level &quot; for <unk> <unk> , <unk> , duurzaamheid , Vision and <unk> .
I &apos;d like to share with you all , like this game with <unk> , over , over , over , over , all over the world , everything in <unk> , who are responsible for each other in <unk> , who are able to give birth to the world .
I &apos;m going to go to it .
I &apos;m going to ask you to tell you something .
Well , think of that ?
We &apos;ve got all of the great <unk> , we have to show games that we can show you , but we &apos;ve got that real world .
And so , I &apos;m sure that you know , I think that you know , I &apos;m going to make sure that there are a lot of <unk> <unk> that we can use to work in real life in real life .
And we have these geese , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> social <unk> <unk> , <unk> and to <unk> .
I &apos;m really , really , that we &apos;re going to have to look at that .
And I &apos;m not , you know , I &apos;d be like that , you know , I &apos;d like to play that like that .
And when I go back to the next decade , I think I &apos;d be able to make two things : we can create all of the <unk> toekomst , and I think we &apos;ll be able to play all sorts of games .
Thank you .
In particular , I &apos;ve been interested in that <unk> . It might be funny to me that was a sign of that , because , you know , I think , like , you look at something like , I think , like , &quot; <unk> , that &apos;s a <unk> , who seems to be <unk> . &quot;
In other words , <unk> in a few studies , have shown in some studies that <unk> , and it was just because that person thinks that was going to be <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> , which is , in <unk> , in <unk> , which is a <unk> effect in the body , which is <unk> .
You know , that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , because he was so wrong .
I think that &apos;s so <unk> , I think I &apos;d like you to get a <unk> , very <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to show you that there &apos;s an <unk> , and that &apos;s a <unk> , which is at least in every single <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;d like to get rid of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
I &apos;m going to give you something to you , and I &apos;ll tell you something .
And then I &apos;m going to tell you , so let me tell you .
So , you know , you see , what was happening next ?
The <unk> that you can study , my hand , you can study that .
I &apos;m taking that kind of <unk> in my way .
I <unk> my <unk> .
And to pay sure that doesn &apos;t come to my face , or from it to me , I &apos;m just going to figure out my neighbor , then I &apos;m just going to get my neighbor right here .
And so I can see that you can see that there is not just a little bit of <unk> . So , for example , there is no <unk> , but I can get no <unk> on it .
And that &apos;s really just <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get my hand , and hopefully , when everything else comes down , it becomes <unk> by my little <unk> <unk> .
So , I &apos;d like to get a look at that place , and I think I &apos;d get a little bit of that , without that <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t go to my <unk> , or <unk> , not <unk> , and you can do everything .
<unk> !
And that &apos;s a <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> for <unk> , because I think you can learn a lot of <unk> , but you can get a very <unk> <unk> .
And so many of you know , many of you know this one thing is this one .
There &apos;s an act of that .
I think <unk> in my hand .
I can tell you that I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> to pay for sure that nothing in my face verdwijnt , and that &apos;s a lie .
And so there is a question that I &apos;m <unk> with my <unk> , which is that the element of <unk> .
And at that moment , where I &apos;m going to <unk> your hand , you can see it from achteren , right here , my <unk> , from here , where there was , in a position , in a position , in a position , in a position , in that way , in the way , in the way , in the face , there was so <unk> .
<unk> ?
And so it &apos;s an achterkant of somebody sitting there , and that was a little kid .
So , here &apos;s there .
And then , when I <unk> , there &apos;s a hand to be there .
And then you can think about why this is a <unk> , which is not that you can see only three vingers , because the spirit , and that type of things , they &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re not <unk> , one , two , three , they &apos;re not <unk> .
But here &apos;s actually right here , right ? And I &apos;m not open .
Of course , it &apos;s got it , but it doesn &apos;t get into the <unk> of my body , but it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be here .
And then , when I put my hand on my hand , then it &apos;s done to me <unk> , which is hidden away by that <unk> .
I take that hand . And here &apos;s the <unk> .
This is an example that you can see your friends and faces . Thank you .
And , was did that <unk> ?
A couple of weeks ago , I read a couple of years ago .
I &apos;m not a arts , and that &apos;s why I was a wonderful thing .
And this is actually the point of view : when you put a <unk> in a form of <unk> , in a form of <unk> , it is just a little , white pil , which is just a <unk> effect .
But then , when you put that , in that sense , in that <unk> <unk> , which is in a smaller pil , and the <unk> , and a letter that is <unk> , it &apos;s extremely valuable .
And it wasn &apos;t just any of a <unk> , it &apos;s just <unk> .
But a white pil is not so good as a <unk> pil .
Oh , right ?
But it turned out that it wasn &apos;t all about .
And when you take <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> like <unk> <unk> like <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> , which is one of the other <unk> and the other <unk> is like a white <unk> .
And so that <unk> is another form .
A pil <unk> to me , is not so good enough to take three bridges -- I can &apos;t tell you a little <unk> .
But that &apos;s really good .
I think that <unk> is a <unk> .
And that one form is true .
And then , when you have the ultieme <unk> <unk> , you need to take a <unk> .
Right ? A <unk> with a <unk> -- a few more <unk> material , which you put a patiënt .
It creates a very <unk> picture in your head , which is much easier to get a white pil .
This is really , really , I &apos;m going to show you a different picture , and I &apos;m going to show you a different moment .
And so , that &apos;s the white pil to make that same <unk> who does not seem to be <unk> who does a <unk> , who doesn &apos;t like that .
And I don &apos;t think anything that is really <unk> . It &apos;s just our belief that we &apos;d be thinking , well , that &apos;s an <unk> effect .
I wanted to know , of course , I wanted to use that concept for a <unk> .
I think it &apos;s a little <unk> , and I &apos;m going to make it real .
Well , we know from that trial , that you have to take a look at that .
This is a number of <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s very <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit more <unk> .
This is actually my <unk> . It &apos;s not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not <unk> from Hollywood .
I &apos;m going to show you a little <unk> in my <unk> , and I &apos;d put it on to <unk> , and to <unk> them on the other kant .
As you &apos;re going to be <unk> -- you know , when you get a little bit of <unk> -- I have a couple of <unk> <unk> , and some of you , a couple of people , which I didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
So I &apos;ll give you a look at that , when you look down , you look at that next 30 seconden .
You can see , you can see , but you can see <unk> , you can see .
So , here , right here , where my <unk> are moving , at the top of my <unk> , I &apos;m going to make a little <unk> .
It &apos;s really <unk> me .
And then just just a little bit of my <unk> , and on the other kant that others were <unk> .
Right now , we are in the same situation , we were at <unk> .
Yeah .
But now you can &apos;t count my vingers , or ?
I &apos;m going to show you . I &apos;ll give you one , 2 , three , four , five .
Well yes .
I know , I think , was that people think , when they look .
And you say , &quot; Okay , so that &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> themselves who are <unk> that <unk> for us a few minutes . &quot;
I &apos;m going to show you .
Who here , right ?
Yeah , I know . And those guys are back to say , &quot; Okay , so . I didn &apos;t see that . &quot;
And those are people in that <unk> , right ?
I &apos;m going to show you here .
It &apos;s actually my <unk> , and it &apos;s not <unk> from Hollywood .
That &apos;s my <unk> , and I can make that <unk> .
I &apos;m sorry . And when you &apos;re going to be <unk> , you look down , you know , look .
The other thing that you go back , you can see that later , that later , you say , &quot; Well , yes , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , so here , you know , here , here , then , here , here , like , here , a gat , you know , here , then , here , a gat , and then , you know , that &apos;s really <unk> . &quot;
Okay , I &apos;d like you to make a little <unk> for you .
Yeah .
I &apos;d like to get that <unk> .
I &apos;d like to <unk> my hand , and you show me that there are no <unk> .
But I think , in this part , and I think , in that sense , from a <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m going to put that thin , and I &apos;d be able to put that naald down , and so on and so on that podium .
We &apos;re going to give us a little bit of that .
I &apos;m so , you know , thank you so much . Thank you very much .
So , in my life , in my life , many <unk> .
I have two <unk> .
This is the first one who was a <unk> <unk> .
It was a little <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> on the <unk> .
And for a vis .
And again , there is a little <unk> in <unk> to <unk> European European European policy .
So , you know , you might be able to get it to you , you know ?
I had a conversation with that music about several months .
On a particular night , the top of the <unk> came to me and said , of course , I &apos;d be able to figure out a little bit about that subject about that <unk> .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
There was an <unk> that was <unk> , and that &apos;s what this problem is that we have become <unk> .
In that number of 50 years , we have the <unk> <unk> that we were <unk> .
It &apos;s really hard to <unk> .
90 percent of the big <unk> , which we love , those yellow , that <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s not quite a lot of over .
And so then , you may be <unk> <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
There are many other <unk> . <unk> the environment , they &apos;re the most of them , they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> .
There is a <unk> 15 to one .
This is , 15 pond <unk> <unk> , that you can get a pond <unk> .
Not very <unk> .
<unk> are not very good .
So here was an <unk> , and that &apos;s really <unk> .
I wanted to stand .
The <unk> to me , I was calling the Queen <unk> for that .
Can we call it .
&quot; Don &quot; , &quot; Don &apos;t say that , &quot; he said , &quot; Just know that that &apos;s obvious , so far , so far , so far , so far in zee , that you know that they &apos;re not <unk> . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; Well , so far , so far , we &apos;re not so far that the <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
And then there &apos;s one hand , &quot; We &apos;re in essentie a <unk> world .
This <unk> from 2.5 to 1 , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Those are the best in <unk> . &quot;
2.5 : great .
&quot; Three to one was ? What <unk> you ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; he said .
&quot; Great , &quot; he said .
At that night , I was in bed , and I was like , &quot; What was in godsnaam ? &quot;
So I go to the next dag , to me , to go to the event , take a look .
I said , &quot; Don , I mean , well , what about duurzame <unk> ? &quot;
There , there , there &apos;s no other way .
Well , I <unk> with a couple of people in that <unk> , and nobody could give me a <unk> problem .
Can &apos;t use it .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; Well , what about duurzame proteïnen ? &quot;
Well , there were some algen and some <unk> <unk> , and then there was <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; Who is <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
In that sense , maybe two percent .
&quot; That &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; Don , I was <unk> , you know , &quot; Do he have a <unk> ? &quot;
And he was a long time in front of <unk> and there , and he said , &quot; It &apos;s got to be a lot of marriage in the world . &quot;
I <unk> from that .
Nee , not because I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;m sure .
Nee , I did <unk> from that kind of <unk> , because , I <unk> in God , you know , the <unk> , the <unk> on his <unk> .
This is another <unk> , which is another form of <unk> .
It &apos;s the romantic type that the guy who knows , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
I put it in a restaurant in <unk> <unk> .
It was a <unk> <unk> <unk> in that kind of age .
You have to be <unk> .
There was an <unk> , with a <unk> , fast <unk> coffee .
And the Koch was sold .
<unk> .
<unk> was <unk> .
In fact , how can you get a <unk> <unk> , when they were sold ?
I can &apos;t , but this one thing does .
There are Miguel <unk> . There is Miguel .
Oh , there was not bought the <unk> , and there is no sign . I &apos;d like that kind of <unk> and I get to understand .
There is a <unk> in <unk> La <unk> .
This is a <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In that <unk> that <unk> was living in that <unk> <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was <unk> .
They made it by that land <unk> .
They were made that complicated <unk> of <unk> , and they were <unk> water out of the land , and it was in the air .
Well , they didn &apos;t have to do that .
<unk> was a ramp .
And it was about 90 percent of the streets , which was for many other vogels .
So in 1982 , 1982 was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
What did they do ?
You have the rivier of water on the ground .
You &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> .
In fact , in plaats of that water <unk> , they used those kanalen to <unk> that water <unk> .
You see <unk> those <unk> .
She was made a <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and they have <unk> <unk> , and they have the <unk> that the green forces are on Earth completely <unk> .
It &apos;s extremely <unk> .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen something else .
You know , when you go to a golf station , you know , a million miles away , and everything was they were seeing , they were <unk> in the sky , and that dense <unk> .
I was no longer <unk> with Miguel .
There is a massive vent , three <unk> Charles Darwin and a half and a half to <unk> .
Okay ? That &apos;s where we were , and we were <unk> by that <unk> and I <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Miguel for <unk> .
There &apos;s an <unk> <unk> .
Well , there &apos;s that <unk> <unk> .
And here , here , there &apos;s an <unk> <unk> , which is it &apos;s called the <unk> giraffe .
And so it turns out that Miguel was the biggest component of his carrière in <unk> National Geographic in Africa .
I made it , who was there , who was that there was a <unk> place .
The <unk> ?
I &apos;m an expert for gender . &quot;
And then there &apos;s an <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and algen and rare <unk> .
And I don &apos;t understand that , well , that was really fascinerend , and you know , that <unk> , you know , that <unk> community are <unk> .
It &apos;s great , but I was verliefd .
So my neighbor &apos;s been in that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that I was <unk> .
And so I got it down . I said , &quot; Miguel , who does that , who is it , you know , how does it get that sound <unk> ? &quot;
There was a <unk> .
&quot; I know , <unk> , those algen , the <unk> , those relaties , that &apos;s <unk> .
But then , you know , well , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
Who is that <unk> ? &quot;
There is to tell me more to tell me that this is a <unk> system that the <unk> <unk> was going to eat .
And those <unk> biomassa , <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> .
The system is so <unk> , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re not <unk> .
And after a day , I &apos;m going to go to <unk> <unk> , and I said , &quot; Well , I said , &quot; Well , in a place , like , you know , they &apos;re going to be so <unk> , &quot; differently , you know , differently , how do you get ? &quot;
And at that moment , it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we get <unk> to that <unk> and bone from <unk> , duizenden and <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , which is quite a little bit .
&quot; It &apos;s success . &quot;
&quot; Look at his <unk> , roze .
You <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ?
I said , &quot; Miguel , <unk> , <unk> them not ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; We lose 20 percent of our vis and <unk> on those vogels .
Well , last year , there were 600,000 vogels , as 250 different <unk> .
It &apos;s the largest and one of the most important <unk> <unk> in Europe .
I said , &quot; Miguel , is it a good <unk> <unk> <unk> , not that guy &apos;s going to <unk> ? &quot;
There are a stick man , right ?
There is , &quot; We &apos;re <unk> <unk> , not <unk> .
This is a <unk> netwerk .
Those <unk> are <unk> .
Those <unk> are <unk> .
And so you <unk> the way that the way that <unk> . &quot;
Okay , let &apos;s get that kind of <unk> . A <unk> , they don &apos;t have to <unk> that .
A <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
Oh , and so on , and so on , that <unk> of <unk> are not there .
You see <unk> in a town 240 kilometer , where those <unk> are <unk> .
In the morning , they fly over 240 kilometers .
And then they &apos;ve launched 240 miles back .
And you do it , because they &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Well seriously .
I had an <unk> of the <unk> , so I came to see Miguel .
I said , &quot; Miguel , are you going to put it 240 km to <unk> , and then they fly 240 km to go ?
Do they do that ? &quot;
And there was me , like , like I just had a lied of Whitney Houston .
There said , &quot; Oh , yeah . You know , because that &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
I didn &apos;t have that <unk> <unk> , which was <unk> , and I could not be <unk> . I &apos;d be <unk> . I &apos;d like to <unk> .
This is <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> a lot of that .
And yet , when I put it in that restaurant in <unk> , they didn &apos;t have to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You know , <unk> <unk> , and when you &apos;re going to make a kiss from the end of the day .
I &apos;d say that for Miguel and <unk> .
And there was a <unk> who does a <unk> .
She &apos;s got that number of <unk> , for something in that body <unk> .
She has developed in the loop of the developing world , for <unk> <unk> .
And then there &apos;s one hand : &quot; But our water does not have <unk> . &quot;
Okay . A <unk> , they don &apos;t get <unk> . A <unk> , who get their lives , they meet their job .
And then , once again , when there was a <unk> , who doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , <unk> there , <unk> there , because that water , because that <unk> , it was made by that <unk> from the rivier .
It &apos;s a rivier , all the things that are <unk> , whether they &apos;re developing countries , they &apos;re going to have to have <unk> , chemical <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And then , when it comes to that system , and this drill has to be <unk> , when it comes to <unk> .
The system is so <unk> , it <unk> water .
So not just a way that they were <unk> , they were not only <unk> , but they were not only a <unk> job , but a <unk> <unk> , but a <unk> , which was a <unk> , but not just for that kind of <unk> , but for a <unk> , but for you .
Because when that water <unk> , <unk> it down .
One trap in the oceaan , I know , but I actually take it , and you &apos;d like to do that , because this <unk> , who are <unk> , who are <unk> .
Man can say that they &apos;re a recept for that <unk> for that future of <unk> and <unk> .
And what we &apos;ve done is that we have a radicaal nieuw concept of landbouw , from one , in the <unk> <unk> .
But for many people , it &apos;s a little bit of that .
We &apos;re not <unk> , we <unk> . We &apos;re <unk> .
We love <unk> . We love little <unk> , and we need over <unk> <unk> .
And then , when you say that those things , that those of you who are going to tell you a little bit of that that &apos;s going to tell you a little bit of <unk> where he talks and says , &quot; Hey , I &apos;m going to be <unk> <unk> , but who are you <unk> ? &quot;
Who were able to make that <unk> ? &quot;
Could I be honest ?
I can &apos;t get that question .
Nee , it &apos;s not , because we have enough amount of calorieën for that world as well as <unk> .
A billion people were <unk> .
A billion -- that &apos;s more like you -- <unk> <unk> <unk> in the distributie , not that <unk> .
And so , I think this is not because they don &apos;t know , because they don &apos;t know about that line of <unk> that we &apos;ve done that .
<unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> on that aarde , Girls <unk> , and that &apos;s all the time that <unk> were <unk> , &quot; If we were <unk> , &quot; you know , &quot; If we were <unk> <unk> <unk> , who does that ? &quot;
It was <unk> . It was that <unk> . It was <unk> .
We &apos;d say , well , it was <unk> , a <unk> in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> , and it &apos;s not landbouw .
Our <unk> are <unk> , not by <unk> <unk> , but by <unk> <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
Not door that <unk> <unk> and <unk> , not <unk> land , not <unk> water , not <unk> water , not <unk> , and <unk> <unk> and <unk> , but <unk> , but in a <unk> .
You &apos;d have to <unk> that <unk> ?
So let &apos;s start with that question : Who are we <unk> ?
Of course , who might be <unk> , who are able to make a <unk> , or <unk> ?
To do that , you look at that <unk> for that <unk> .
It &apos;s really <unk> , and it is <unk> .
<unk> , scheikunde and machines are able to <unk> into <unk> , and it has never got a good amount to <unk> .
Now , when we look at that , we &apos;re at the fundamental model .
This is , by two billion years of <unk> <unk> .
You see Miguel , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So those of you who are not in classrooms , those are <unk> <unk> in terms of <unk> , <unk> , those <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who are not just <unk> , but experts for relaties , but experts for relaties , they are <unk> .
But they are <unk> , who are experts for <unk> .
And then , if I &apos;m not , I &apos;m going to give you a better sign if I &apos;m going to make you .
You know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s going to be good enough , I think it &apos;s <unk> .
Thank you .
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> science fiction .
In my <unk> <unk> , I was at school , a little <unk> per trip .
And my leg was to me in a book , a <unk> , which is my head in other werelden in other werelden , and to <unk> that <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is <unk> that I did , when I was not in school , when I was not in school , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and bugs and <unk> , everything from <unk> , everything that was to <unk> and <unk> .
I was total <unk> , you know .
So , I was trying to figure out that , to understand that the world was <unk> and that grenzen of <unk> <unk> .
And my love science fiction seemed to be <unk> in my <unk> , because in the late 60s , we pulled up to the maan and <unk> that deep .
Jacques Cousteau was in our <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was <unk> us and <unk> and a world and a world of wonder that we never wanted to imagine .
I think this is really good at that <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> .
I could draw . I could roll .
There was no <unk> video games of <unk> movies that made all the <unk> <unk> in that kind of <unk> , I &apos;d have to create those images in my face .
So we used to do all the time , and when we read as a young boy , we put that beschrijving of <unk> and <unk> to that canvas in our hoofd .
So my dad was <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , robots , <unk> and everything .
In <unk> , I was <unk> by the <unk> , who I was , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
And that creativiteit was supposed to be <unk> .
And he did something that was interesting . And what happened to me was an Jacques <unk> shows that there was a lot of <unk> world on us in our world .
I still didn &apos;t have a <unk> world to get a <unk> world .
But here was a world that I could get on in the aarde , right here , and it was so fascinerend and exotic who was all that , which was , was , was , in fact , that was , when I had ever seen that .
So I decided , when I was 15 , he was <unk> .
The other issue was that I was in a small town in Canada , 1000 miles away from the next day .
I didn &apos;t get <unk> .
I <unk> my vader , until there was a <unk> in <unk> , New York , to <unk> , right there , on the other kant that we lived .
I made my <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> , New York City .
In fact , in the end , a real time , a real day , I &apos;d get two years to come to California .
Well , in this 40 years , I think it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve spent three and a half hours in <unk> .
And I &apos;ve learned that that the world of deep <unk> , in that <unk> oceanen , such as HIV <unk> in <unk> lives , who is not really <unk> .
The <unk> of nature doesn &apos;t know about <unk> , in tegenstelling in our own , <unk> human intelligence .
In the meantime , I &apos;m going to highlight a lot of excitement to that , which was to me , I was looking at my <unk> .
And my love in the end , to me , with the same <unk> , with the <unk> and you .
When I was a <unk> <unk> , it was <unk> .
And so that &apos;s the best possible <unk> , to tell me , to tell me , to tell me , to tell me , to tell me , that &apos;s <unk> .
As a kind of <unk> , I was <unk> and so forth .
So films , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And yes , they were <unk> , which I <unk> , from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
In &quot; <unk> , &quot; was <unk> for that <unk> , and that was <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> my <unk> are my <unk> .
What was interesting about this is that <unk> : To build a <unk> problem in that film -- and we were able to <unk> that kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The first <unk> was that the first <unk> <unk> that you saw in a film .
The film was not a money , right , there was a <unk> , but there was a lot of <unk> , but I realized that this publiek was in the past world , who was <unk> , who was <unk> .
The Arthur <unk> &apos;s wet is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
So , you know , you see something <unk> .
And that was me very exciting .
And I thought to me , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s <unk> in that <unk> . &quot;
So we went to &quot; <unk> 2 , &quot; my next film , and my next film .
And together with <unk> , we created that <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s the cause , which is really the cause of that effect , who &apos;d come to this effect .
And it werkte . And again , we had a little <unk> , and that &apos;s the impact in the part . And that &apos;s what we did in the film was a little bit of <unk> .
So from that kind of <unk> , there was a whole new world of <unk> , a <unk> world of creativiteit to <unk> .
So I joined a <unk> , put together with my <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was the <unk> <unk> and <unk> . She was called &quot; Digital <unk> . &quot;
And that <unk> this was , in fact , that <unk> <unk> process made up that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and to start to start with digital <unk> .
And so we did that , and we were <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
But in the end of 90 , we found out that we were at <unk> and <unk> -- where we were doing that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;d say , &quot; Avatar , &quot; which is <unk> that the <unk> <unk> in that type of <unk> effects and <unk> effects on <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , that <unk> were <unk> . And that <unk> were <unk> . And that would be <unk> .
But that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and those of you in my <unk> , I thought that we were <unk> that we were not able to make that .
So <unk> , I made it , and I took that kind of <unk> over that big schip .
The <unk> that I did like , &quot; <unk> and Julia at a script , &quot; is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , but I wanted to <unk> to the real <unk> of Titanic .
I &apos;ve done that film .
That &apos;s the truth . The Studio was not .
I was sure , and I was saying , &quot; We &apos;re an <unk> <unk> . We film that real <unk> .
We &apos;ve got to show it in <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s extremely important . It &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
And I <unk> them , they were <unk> .
Klinkt crazy , but it &apos;s coming back to that that you can create a reality , a reality .
We were also <unk> in the middle of a reality , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , four kilometers , in the form of <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s a real <unk> <unk> .
This was not a film , not <unk> , it was real .
So , that &apos;s really <unk> me .
And that <unk> were enormous . We needed camera and <unk> and everything that was <unk> .
And I thought , well , that <unk> , who was <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
After all , they were <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
In this <unk> , then you get in that <unk> , in this deep , <unk> environment , where they &apos;re not going to go to <unk> , you know , when you &apos;re not going to do that .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s like , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s in a <unk> .
It &apos;s really cool . &quot;
I was actually <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
The other thing that kind of <unk> and <unk> , was everything . It was <unk> , it was <unk> , it was <unk> .
And it was a experience that I could not give up .
Because , you know , I &apos;d be able to imagine a little bit of that , for that kind of that we could get a visual effect , but I couldn &apos;t see that first thing .
The other thing that I saw in <unk> <unk> , and some things that I &apos;ve never had ever seen before , I &apos;d be sure that there was no other things before that wasn &apos;t yet possible and yet that we were looking at that .
And so I got <unk> , and I wanted to <unk> .
And so , I was a little <unk> <unk> .
I said to the cause of &quot; Titanic &quot; , &quot; Good to my <unk> , &quot; I will call my <unk> as an <unk> in Hollywood at a time , and then I &apos;m going to <unk> a little <unk> .
And then we started <unk> this <unk> .
We were <unk> <unk> , and <unk> them with <unk> .
We <unk> to <unk> the Titanic .
We made small robots , which we &apos;ve been built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
It was our <unk> , <unk> and looking at the face of <unk> , which was never done before .
Nobody had been able to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and I had no <unk> for that . And so we created that .
After all , I sit down there , on the <unk> of Titanic , in a <unk> , and then <unk> , that these are <unk> , and that I know that you know , always I know , you know , always , you know , always , you know , you know , always , you know , you know , always , you know , you know , any video that was played here .
And I <unk> with a little <unk> on that party <unk> .
I <unk> it , but my brain is in <unk> .
It felt like , like , like , I was in the process , as a result in the <unk> of Titanic .
This was the <unk> form of a <unk> , which I &apos;ve been given . Because for a <unk> <unk> , I knew , I know , in the <unk> , I &apos;d like to <unk> the film , because I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> <unk> .
And that particular <unk> was an accurate kopie of <unk> <unk> .
So that was a very rare experience .
So , you know , that <unk> me , of course , that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s not that you will be conscious of consciousness , in that other form in that other form .
It was very <unk> <unk> .
And so , maybe a little bit of a notice , maybe a little bit of a couple of decades , in a few decades , to figure out what to do , and to do something to do that , in all sorts of things , in all sorts of things , in all sorts of things that I can imagine as <unk> .
In this <unk> , we started looking at that <unk> , we know , we know , we have to figure out what that <unk> , which is the <unk> , where we were <unk> , and they were <unk> .
They live with <unk> <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t exist in a larger <unk> <unk> system , who are we doing it .
And so you see , there are <unk> , who are on a 500 degrees Celsius .
<unk> . And you can &apos;t imagine that they &apos;re able to do that .
And so there was always a little bit of <unk> , that was me in <unk> , that was <unk> from my youth .
And so I joined up with that people who are interested in that space , and that &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> <unk> .
It was fascinerend .
But it took me back to that , for me , that I made <unk> with us in that depth .
I brought them to and <unk> them to the world at the globe : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that were <unk> for those <unk> <unk> , and I made them <unk> , you know , <unk> , you know , you can get <unk> , you can get <unk> and <unk> .
We were <unk> , <unk> , but in fact , in <unk> , <unk> .
So , from a way , from my head , that <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> , and was that real .
In that <unk> , I learned a lot of <unk> .
I &apos;ve learned a lot of wetenschap , but I have a lot of over <unk> .
Now , you may think , you have to have a <unk> , you have to have a <unk> , you know , a <unk> who does .
But I don &apos;t know , but I don &apos;t know , <unk> , for me , for that <unk> <unk> .
Because in a particular point , I &apos;d say , &quot; What are I going to do here ?
Why do that ? What does it get ? &quot;
These <unk> are not a <unk> .
We play that <unk> .
All right , I think , &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and &quot; Avatar , &quot; and I &apos;d have a <unk> that <unk> on the strand of the strand .
I put all these films , <unk> , for a very <unk> publiek .
Not a <unk> , not a great job .
You know , that &apos;s what you want to do with the <unk> -- and the end of the <unk> environment , which is the <unk> environment , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , which is that , when a small group of people are <unk> a team .
Because we were all about 10 to 12 people , and they &apos;ve been running around for a long time <unk> <unk> .
And in this community , you know , that that &apos;s the main thing that the main thing that <unk> is that you have to <unk> , because you have a <unk> , that you can &apos;t be <unk> .
And then when you go to land and say , &quot; Well , we were able to do that <unk> , that <unk> , and that <unk> , all kinds of <unk> , and those problems , that the other thing is not that , then you can do that , then you can do that , and then you know , that &apos;s <unk> from soldiers , &quot; and they know that they &apos;re not <unk> .
That &apos;s a link , a <unk> respect .
So if I were to get back to my next film , &quot; Avatar , I &apos;ve been able to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , &quot; which is that you were <unk> , and you get <unk> into that <unk> .
And that &apos;s what that revolution really changed .
And so I &apos;d go back to a small team in <unk> <unk> , and we saw &quot; Avatar , &quot; where he was not .
<unk> .
It &apos;s a massive <unk> .
And we were going to get a periode of four and a half decades .
And that &apos;s always my form of art , right ?
And they were <unk> , who didn &apos;t know , we had a <unk> <unk> , and we were <unk> to Pandora .
I was more like a <unk> child , my job , which is the <unk> process , which is changing the difference .
So what are we going to do ?
What are we going to do ?
I think , at the bottom , it &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s the most important part of that .
We have a force which is a power of a reality .
And that <unk> <unk> team is really important as any <unk> of this world .
I &apos;d say <unk> <unk> , which says , &quot; Please , give me some advice , who says I could do something . &quot;
And I say , &quot; <unk> you not .
The other thing for you to do that . <unk> it to you , don &apos;t pay for yourself , pay attention to themselves . Just use risico .
The NASA was so <unk> : &quot; <unk> is not another alternatief . &quot;
But in the art , and when I think that &apos;s <unk> , I think it &apos;s a gift , because there &apos;s a <unk> .
It didn &apos;t have significant business , <unk> <unk> , you were not <unk> .
You &apos;ve got to be able to be able to do that .
This is the idea that I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of that . I think that &apos;s a difference , but I think it &apos;s a alternatief , not . Thank you .
So I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of <unk> that that is all the data that we eat faster than the som of the <unk> , and in order to think of that <unk> to think that you can think about how to use informatie , and we don &apos;t understand trends that can be <unk> .
So , there was a typical <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m <unk> here , that is a little experiment .
It was <unk> , and I was <unk> with <unk> , that I could get a certain amount of <unk> , we can get <unk> .
And immediately , I look at a different brain , that &apos;s what makes that happen .
And that &apos;s because in <unk> here , that people are at <unk> , they &apos;re sitting here in <unk> .
So we can get a step down , and we &apos;re going to figure out that data from <unk> and see that <unk> and kanker that are <unk> , but not for everybody .
And when we go to step and look at 10 years of <unk> , we &apos;re going to see that <unk> <unk> that <unk> are <unk> that people are worried about that that makes people not worry .
And of course , on <unk> , that &apos;s especially <unk> for mannen .
You see , you know , that kind of mass of all kinds of data , and data <unk> in that particular <unk> <unk> .
And when we can make that for <unk> , why not for content ?
And what we &apos;ve done here is that we &apos;ve got that <unk> <unk> every single <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> .
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online .
I think it &apos;s just going to be able to look at my talk in your <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> in a decade .
You can live in a moment .
And you can jump to a certain point to light .
So , when I look at that , I see those <unk> , which is the <unk> , and that <unk> .
I was a <unk> Armstrong , also <unk> , so that I &apos;ve made an <unk> <unk> in that <unk> Armstrong .
Now , when I was a <unk> <unk> , I might be thinking , &quot; OK , so what if I go to <unk> , &quot; OK , then I &apos;d like to look at that ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to go to a step and <unk> that perspective .
I see Greg <unk> .
And so you get a sense of that , you know , when you look at that kind of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you don ’ t see not .
You know , that &apos;s a little bit different .
It &apos;s a bit of that , and we think that &apos;s the way that we can think that kind of <unk> can be <unk> .
I think this is a little bit <unk> that was a little bit of <unk> .
And what we &apos;ve done here is , we &apos;ve made each other <unk> and put it into a small <unk> .
And this is a <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s an <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s what it does .
I &apos;m going to give you a look at that top 500 of <unk> <unk> .
But in that <unk> , we can see a lot of things .
<unk> , we get a sense of that things that we think about those things in Wikipedia are <unk> .
I &apos;m going to argue that what &apos;s going to be <unk> .
Now , when I &apos;ve described to <unk> , I realize that that <unk> , which is that the <unk> , which is the way to cover the number of things called <unk> .
This is really important , because this is really important , it &apos;s not that kind of <unk> .
This is actually to recognize when you go to a <unk> and look at that .
And so that <unk> , I think this is a certain amount of <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , &quot; People are coming to see , all together .
So , when I recognize all of these people , I realize that those meerderheid of <unk> are <unk> . Some of you come from . Some of us , there are <unk> from <unk> , and that &apos;s where there is a <unk> .
And interestingly , Bono is a TED Prize .
So we can jump up and look at a look at all the TED Prize .
You see , we look at , we look at the net as the first time of it as a <unk> , not just like <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And so I &apos;d like to show you a little wonder that was a little <unk> .
I &apos;m just going to show you just that New York Times website .
<unk> , this one thing -- I &apos;m not going to call it a <unk> ; it &apos;s not a <unk> , but you can see websites , but then you can see , and we put that <unk> to all of that .
So I can get a step back , and you get a little bit of <unk> <unk> .
And so that &apos;s why , because you know , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s <unk> from websites in that kind of <unk> in this form and so forth , all of the things that can look like .
And so I can <unk> up in a particular <unk> .
Here &apos;s the kind of <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve done to be there .
And I could just figure out everything I &apos;ve ever seen today .
And then , when I go to a <unk> , and look at everything , I can get my <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and here , I think , on <unk> , here , from a <unk> , here , from here , here from Live Labs .
So , from here , I can go into that street , and they get <unk> .
It &apos;s a metafoor that has always been used for every time , and every time it comes to make the difference in the <unk> .
At that moment , in this world , we think that data is <unk> .
And we have the <unk> of <unk> .
We have the <unk> of <unk> .
And what if we were able to push that kind of thing , and that &apos;s the Internet , that we &apos;d be able to figure out something else that &apos;s going to be able to figure out more than many things , and then the patronen of things that were hidden away ?
If we can do that , then this <unk> <unk> <unk> , maybe a number of <unk> animals .
And in order to move it into <unk> , we can actually get kennis .
And then , when we get kennis , we might be able to get <unk> from <unk> .
That &apos;s me , thank you very much .
Every talk about that .
I set up a couple of people who are kind of five and a half thousand years ago , they &apos;ve been published in the next five years , and they used to get it up until about 40 , and they were <unk> .
And he has a large golf course of <unk> <unk> .
It has a lot of <unk> .
So , everybody would love that <unk> .
But in all of this gas process , there are certain <unk> <unk> that it might be just <unk> to think about geluk .
And my talk about my talk today will come to look at that <unk> <unk> .
So it &apos;s true for <unk> that you think about their personal <unk> , and it &apos;s actually <unk> for wetenschappers over geluk , because that turns out that we are at all kinds of other .
The first one is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , you know .
And it turns out that this word is not just an idea worth of <unk> .
I think there &apos;s some meaning that we could make it , but in the top of it , it &apos;s something that we &apos;re supposed to be <unk> , and we &apos;re not supposed to be <unk> , and we were trying to think that &apos;s <unk> .
The other way that the other way is a <unk> of <unk> and confidence : In fact , they &apos;re living in their lives and gelukkig are alive to live in their lives and to live in their lives .
And these are two very different concepten , and they &apos;re both <unk> in that sense of happiness .
And that derde is that <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> feit that we can &apos;t think about what we think about , of welzijn has been <unk> .
I mean , that &apos;s a real <unk> .
It &apos;s just not a way to get .
Well , I would like to work with someone else , which was a <unk> <unk> , which was a story called a <unk> . &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; -- there was a <unk> , and it was completely <unk> , and it was completely <unk> .
And then there are some <unk> , really , really , in that kind of <unk> .
But it wasn &apos;t .
The <unk> had been <unk> that experience .
There was that experience .
There was 20 minutes to <unk> .
You know , she was not there , because there was a happy <unk> , which was <unk> , and that was a happy person was everything there was .
What you think that really is that we think we can think about us and think of other people , in ways of thinking about two types of self .
And I think that &apos;s a <unk> of that every single day , and that can know that that &apos;s in the moment , in that moment , that &apos;s happening , but in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact , that in fact
It &apos;s the <unk> zelf , that &apos;s the arts <unk> -- you know , when the arts is asked , &quot; Oh , so I &apos;m going to <unk> you here ? &quot;
And then there is a <unk> of <unk> , and that <unk> and that part of our lives is <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> that the arts <unk> door that question is , &quot; What are you in recent time ? &quot;
&quot; Who was your <unk> trip to <unk> ? &quot;
These are two very different <unk> , and that <unk> , and that <unk> , and those two of them are part of the <unk> of art .
And that <unk> itself is a verhalenverteller .
And so that starts to do something with a basic reactie on our herinneringen -- it starts immediately .
And we don &apos;t have to tell you a little bit of <unk> .
It tells us that our <unk> tells us , well , what we know about our <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to play that <unk> with an example .
It &apos;s a very early trial .
These are real <unk> , who are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to go into the details , it &apos;s not quite pijnlijk , it was pijnlijk , but it was pijnlijk in <unk> .
You &apos;ve got to give you a <unk> , all the 60 seconden about their <unk> .
And here are two people . They are <unk> .
And you were supposed to be asked , &quot; Wie did that <unk> ? &quot;
And that &apos;s a pretty cool question .
<unk> B is <unk> <unk> . There was a little bit of <unk> , and maybe a minute of pijn , which was someone in other <unk> B , and everything else .
But he &apos;s another question : &quot; Who thought that you were suffering that they were suffering ? &quot;
And here is an verrassing .
And that verrassing is that someone &apos;s got a much more <unk> <unk> <unk> that was <unk> that drug B.
Those of those talks of <unk> were different , and that &apos;s because of a <unk> part of that story , who is <unk> .
It &apos;s not that <unk> <unk> of great -- but one of them is really <unk> , but one of them is <unk> .
And that is that that <unk> was , where the <unk> was at its <unk> , it was a terrible story .
Where do we know ?
Because we asked these guys to their <unk> <unk> , and it got a little bit later : &quot; Who &apos;s been doing that ? &quot;
And she was too much worse for A to B in <unk> .
That &apos;s a direct conflict between the <unk> zelf and the <unk> zelf .
In fact , from <unk> , B was a <unk> day .
And then , you know , what you could do with someone else , and we have <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s going to be able to do that , you know , that you could not get that <unk> by a line of money , rather than <unk> .
And that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , which is that the patient &apos;s got a little bit and more less and more than any other .
And when you have a couple of minutes long long enough , that the <unk> zelf is a little bit of patient &apos;s <unk> and you have a little bit of <unk> from patiënt a little bit of money , because then you have a little bit of a better history of that experience .
<unk> sign a book ?
And it &apos;s true that that &apos;s true that that &apos;s <unk> us , and it &apos;s <unk> for those verhalen that we can create .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , significant <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> are really , really important , in this case , that &apos;s <unk> .
And that <unk> itself live in the <unk> of life .
It has <unk> <unk> , one another .
And you ask me : What are you doing with this ?
And that &apos;s really easy . They &apos;re only lost .
I mean , that &apos;s the most <unk> of our lives -- and I have the <unk> -- you know , that most of three minutes long . And you know , you know , think of that , you know , you know , in a lifetime , in a maand , in a maand , they don &apos;t have .
Most of them are not necessarily the <unk> of <unk> .
And yet , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s what you think about that , you know , they &apos;d think that they &apos;re going to hear that , for example , when that <unk> in <unk> are in our <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> <unk> that we are <unk> when we &apos;re in that world .
And who seems that we were <unk> , but it &apos;s not that part of that that &apos;s not that the <unk> zelf for us .
So we have the <unk> zelf , and that <unk> , and they &apos;re really <unk> .
The biggest difference among them is the other thing .
In fact , from the <unk> zelf , if you have a vakantie and the next week , it &apos;s the first week to that first , then that &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> vakantie .
So it doesn &apos;t work for that <unk> zelf .
And for that <unk> self is a <unk> vakantie as a <unk> vakantie like <unk> <unk> , because they were not <unk> .
You have that history of that .
And so there is a little bit of that that &apos;s critical <unk> , which is a <unk> of a <unk> zelf of a <unk> of a <unk> .
And that <unk> itself is <unk> to tell and tell .
It &apos;s <unk> , the <unk> , because if you have a patiënt , we &apos;ve been able to get two <unk> on two different <unk> and choose , which is what you need to ask , which is , of course , who are willing to be <unk> , which is that one who does be <unk> , that is <unk> .
The <unk> that <unk> had no stem cells .
In fact , that &apos;s not that we &apos;re not getting from <unk> .
And when we think that we think we think we think about those of us , we think we don &apos;t think more like that .
We think about our <unk> as a <unk> herinneringen .
And in fact , you can look at that , you know , as a <unk> of <unk> zelf , and you can &apos;t think of the <unk> zelf as one , that <unk> through experience , that the <unk> zelf does not have .
I think that if we &apos;re a little bit of that , I &apos;d like to do that .
And that &apos;s a little bit of <unk> , I think .
I mean , who are <unk> <unk> ?
And that is one of the reason that that does have to be <unk> that <unk> of <unk> .
And then , when I look at that , I think I think a vakantie that we have a couple of <unk> in Antarctica , which was the best <unk> to me , and I think , and I think more often , and I think it &apos;s more likely to be more <unk> .
And I &apos;ve heard that <unk> <unk> , I &apos;d say that <unk> trip , I &apos;d say 25 minutes long in the next four years .
And then , when I opened that map , I had a little <unk> in doing that , I &apos;d have a few months .
This is three weken , and it &apos;s <unk> a couple of weeks ago .
That &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
Well , I may be a little bit <unk> , you know , who I &apos;m going to do , you know , who are <unk> , but , in fact , when you have a real question , then , in fact , when you have a real question , why are we willing to make a real question ?
So , so I &apos;m going to think that you think about a <unk> .
You know , looking at your next vakantie , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Of course , you can pick up those <unk> ? And if you were going to pick up a different <unk> of myself , and you have to think more about that conflict , and that &apos;s really not really <unk> , and then you have a sense of thinking , but when you think about how to think that in a way , then you might be thinking .
And so why we think that <unk> are a problem that we think that &apos;s a problem , which is that we &apos;re <unk> with one another .
And those two types of <unk> are <unk> by <unk> .
And I think there are two concepten of happiness that we can use to use a product .
And you can say , well , who are <unk> ?
And then you would ask you to ask , who are <unk> that <unk> in life ?
And they &apos;re all -- <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
And what are that emoties , they can be <unk> ?
And , besides , we &apos;ve got to get a more good sense of <unk> from <unk> over that time .
And when you think about that <unk> of <unk> , it &apos;s another other thing .
And that &apos;s not how a person live .
It &apos;s about , who are willing to be happy that one person &apos;s suffering about their lives .
It &apos;s quite different .
So , in fact , those of you who are not different from that . I think of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m sure many of you have a lot of researchers over welzijn , that study that study began to be long <unk> .
The other one is the <unk> of <unk> , and the more likely the <unk> of <unk> in the last year , and then you &apos;ve been able to figure out that more <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> community has been introduced to a developing world , as a result of a half thousand thousand people around them , over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again .
So in the last few years , we started starting to learn that certain kinds of <unk> .
And that <unk> that I think we have , I think , in fact , that I think that &apos;s really <unk> .
You can know , who are willing to be <unk> with their lives , and they don &apos;t think so much about it , who makes a good life and vice versa .
To give you a sense of <unk> , that &apos;s what &apos;s been <unk> .
And what does that mean is that when you get someone , you &apos;d say , oh , you &apos;d say , oh , a <unk> , who is a <unk> , who knows that ?
Well , you might think about its size , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And you have some of that .
As I say , someone &apos;s life like eight to a <unk> of 10 <unk> , you have a lot of onzekerheid over , who are happy with their <unk> zelf .
That &apos;s a lot of interaction .
We know what that might be .
We know that money is really important , really important .
We know that happiness is <unk> with people , we think we &apos;re <unk> , and we &apos;re going to live with people , we think that we are .
There is other <unk> , but it is dominant .
So when you &apos;ve been able to find that certain kinds of <unk> , you &apos;ve been able to get a very different things .
And that <unk> that I said , that &apos;s what I said is that we should not be interested in <unk> .
It &apos;s a completely different term .
Well , again , there is a different question , which is that we can &apos;t think of thinking about thinking that we &apos;re not at all sorts of things that we &apos;re thinking about when we live in that life , and when we live .
So when you ask that easy question , who are happy that people in Californië are not getting that <unk> ?
And when you ask this question , you think that those people in Californië are more likely to live in Ohio .
And what he was doing is that when you think of that in Californië , you think it &apos;s going to be thinking about that difference between California and other parts , and that difference is true .
And it turns out that klimaat is not really important for that <unk> zelf , and it &apos;s not even more important for that <unk> zelf , it would be <unk> .
But , because that &apos;s <unk> on that <unk> , you can get it -- some of you could go -- a couple of people from it .
And it &apos;s really interesting to <unk> , and that &apos;s what happens to people who are in <unk> in all kinds of things .
Well , their <unk> <unk> are not gelukkiger .
We know this .
But he &apos;s going to be able to figure out . You think they &apos;re gelukkiger , because when they were thinking about it , they were <unk> in Ohio , and they were feeling that <unk> in Ohio .
It &apos;s really hard to think more about welzijn , and I hoop , I &apos;m not sure you &apos;ll give you a sense of it .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question .
Thank you very much .
Well , if we were a few weken of a couple of weeks ago , I &apos;d like to tell you that it was a very interesting outcome , which was a very interesting number in that <unk> .
Is that what you can do with that ?
Daniel <unk> : Yeah .
I think this is <unk> <unk> that we found in <unk> <unk> that we were not supposed to be <unk> .
And we found it in terms of <unk> <unk> .
If we were <unk> , who are <unk> by the country .
And it turns out that in a country of 60,000 dollars per year , for Amerikanen , and that &apos;s a big number of Americans -- it &apos;s a big <unk> , but it &apos;s a big <unk> sample , in a income per country in the year .
CA : 60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars per year are <unk> , and they were <unk> <unk> , you were <unk> .
And that &apos;s where we get a <unk> .
I mean , I mean , I have to see that , I actually have to have an <unk> <unk> .
And what &apos;s going to happen , is it &apos;s not that money in a <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s not that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we can do that <unk> .
In fact , in the sense of others , the <unk> zelf , then you get a different story .
You &apos;ve got to make a lot of money , and that &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s not true for emoties .
CA : But Danny , in the entire country , are able to live in the <unk> , vrijheid , to <unk> .
And then , when people think of that <unk> , I think it seems to me , it &apos;s all the way to do that , everything we think we think about in order to think about <unk> and so forth .
Is there any more likely to be that <unk> , that the country in which that would be a <unk> , who makes that great <unk> ?
<unk> : You know , I think it &apos;s <unk> for that <unk> for that .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to happen in the United States , not to be a question , but in the U.K . , it &apos;s in other countries in other countries .
Those of you who are doing , they think that they think that they think a little bit of thinking about geluk .
And it gets a little bit of that , and those of those people were able to learn from <unk> , and they were <unk> that they were <unk> <unk> that we were <unk> .
The other thing that you can make a sense of <unk> , that you think of how you think of that <unk> , you think , of course , think of that <unk> zelf , of course , to think of that <unk> .
I think it &apos;s going to be politiek beïnvloeden , I think , in that day .
In that moment , in the end of the United States , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
I think this is what I think in the next one is a half of two decades of the National <unk> .
CA : Well , it seems to me , this concept is , of course , should be able to think about , of course , should be able to think about that <unk> politieke discussie over that next few years .
Thank you so much for that .
Thank you , Danny <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about <unk> and klimaat .
And that was a surprise , because that &apos;s what my <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> for <unk> and <unk> that we can create , and we need to create something that we need to create the armste two billion in our lives .
But the <unk> and the klimaat are really important for these people , even more importantly than everyone else on Earth .
<unk> betekent that they &apos;re not going to be <unk> around many years . We have to be too much of a <unk> , and those things are really <unk> .
This is <unk> . It comes to <unk> .
So , a <unk> <unk> for them .
And that &apos;s <unk> for them .
In fact , that , when you were able to reduce the amount of money , they were able to reduce the cost of <unk> .
And that <unk> is about that <unk> .
In fact , that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> was called the Industriële Revolutie , and in the 20th century there was a <unk> case in <unk> , and so we have <unk> , <unk> , we can restore modern materialen and do that .
So we are in a beautiful situation in the <unk> world of electricity .
But then , when we reduce the <unk> -- we &apos;d get a <unk> <unk> -- we &apos;re going to get a new <unk> , and this is the <unk> with CO2 .
The CO2 is going to the planet , and that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
You see the <unk> CO2 , which is <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> has a lot of negatieve impact . effects on that , and maybe worse , that that <unk> <unk> that those natural ecosysteem could not relate that , that those <unk> impacts are <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s the other thing that you see between a <unk> and <unk> <unk> and where they were left .
And it turns out that , you know , that &apos;s <unk> , who does not get that . But they were extremely <unk> !
I used to ask those <unk> questions : &quot; Do we have to go down to a <unk> ?
<unk> doesn &apos;t have that much less ? &quot;
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to go to is that we &apos;re going to go to a little bit of nul , which is the temperatuur left .
That &apos;s a big deal .
The other thing is to say , we have a three meter of <unk> <unk> , which is one of three feet <unk> .
This is going to go down there , right there .
We <unk> per jaar of a <unk> <unk> , about 26 miljard ton .
In fact , there are 20 pounds of 20 tons .
And by the average , it &apos;s about five tons of electricity on it .
And we have to figure out that , you know , figure out that that &apos;s going to be a bit of <unk> .
It &apos;s got a lot of <unk> .
The other economische impact have made it completely beïnvloed and we need to increase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This vergelijking does have four factoren . A little bit of <unk> , which is the left -- carbon dioxide -- that is a little <unk> of people who are <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the average people who are <unk> in dollars , which are the <unk> <unk> for every <unk> <unk> and the CO2 , that are <unk> .
So let &apos;s give you a look at all sorts of <unk> , and we figure out , who are we going to get it on nul .
And I think that &apos;s going to be quite a look at that .
That &apos;s right , but we are <unk> .
So let &apos;s first look at that .
Today , <unk> are in <unk> cities .
And it <unk> up to 9 miljard <unk> that are going to move up to nine .
If we were working with <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , we could get it to 10 percent of 15 percent of 15 percent , but we see a <unk> for them .
The other factor that <unk> are <unk> .
That &apos;s all the stuff that <unk> , which we eat , <unk> , TV , <unk> .
These are really good things , and <unk> , they &apos;re able to do this , in order to get each other in the world .
It &apos;s great , that &apos;s the point .
In the other hand , in the other world , in the top of the average , we might be <unk> <unk> and money , but by the average of every year and every year , they &apos;ve been <unk> every year and more than 20 dollars for that .
Here we see a very <unk> <unk> . Is it home to be able to read that pay attention ?
And they don &apos;t have students , they were <unk> and they read their <unk> <unk> .
And by <unk> , the E , the <unk> <unk> -- it has to be good nieuws .
We have a little bit of that .
So , by some of those things in <unk> <unk> , by other <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> , there are a lot of <unk> that <unk> can be <unk> for dramatically , <unk> <unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
Some of those <unk> are <unk> to 90 percent .
In other words , who <unk> from <unk> , 105 miles : <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , is <unk> .
In fact , when we &apos;re optimistic , then maybe we get a <unk> <unk> to three or a half of them , maybe a <unk> <unk> .
But for the first three things , we &apos;ve been able to <unk> 26 billion dollars on <unk> , and that is simply not <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to see that the vierde factor -- and this becomes a <unk> -- that &apos;s the fate of CO2 , which is a lot of carbon <unk> .
The question is , of course , you can get it on nul .
And then , when you were <unk> , no .
If you were gas , there are no .
In fact , there are a <unk> <unk> for electricity <unk> today , except that <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
And so , we &apos;ve got to have a global scale to create a new system .
We need <unk> .
And then , when I call that term , &quot; wonder , I don &apos;t know .
The <unk> is a wonder . The PC is a wonder .
The Internet , and that &apos;s what &apos;s a wonder .
And those of you here have a lot of people here , many of this wonder .
Now , in fact , there are no <unk> that you need to be a wonder of <unk> .
You know , there &apos;s still other <unk> and some other <unk> , other ones .
But in this case , we &apos;ve got <unk> and a wonder that we &apos;ve got a wonder in very many times .
Well , I said , who does that ?
Is there any of a natural <unk> , which is a <unk> that that &apos;s really <unk> ?
I was reminded me last year , if I beat it , and I &apos;d be able to get that .
And that sense is really <unk> to <unk> , you know , you know , they &apos;re going to live with muggen .
So , for me , that &apos;s a big <unk> .
I decided to <unk> that <unk> from <unk> <unk> to the environment here .
So here are some of our <unk> <unk> .
You know , I mean , they don &apos;t have to happen . In fact , they were not <unk> .
There are all sorts of <unk> who are , but they &apos;re all <unk> .
So we have to address <unk> , including a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and so it turns out that they &apos;re looking at a lot of things that are looking at <unk> , but I think it &apos;s really <unk> .
I have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
So this could be a <unk> piece of paper and then when they were better for me , that &apos;s really cool , but my <unk> are here , but my <unk> , and we can &apos;t be <unk> , because they &apos;re <unk> , because they were <unk> .
Let &apos;s see , we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , including houtskool , or gas .
The other thing that you have to do , it seems like that , but it &apos;s not . I &apos;d like that , you know , all of the carbon dioxide that comes down , it &apos;s going to be <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and then in the lower <unk> and hope .
There &apos;s some <unk> that it &apos;s at 60 percent -- 80 percent , but it &apos;s 100 percent <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> for that <unk> for that <unk> is a big deal . But the biggest issue here is the <unk> .
So how does it make it ?
Of course , how could it be <unk> , and how many of you have a lot of miljarden dollars for each other or a way ?
It &apos;s a lot of volume .
So that &apos;s a good good <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
It has three big problems . The cost , for sure , in <unk> countries in <unk> countries , which is that you can feel that a little <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , which is <unk> that the <unk> <unk> are used for <unk> .
And then what does it do with that ?
Because it wasn &apos;t really big , there is a lot of ourselves .
Those people who feel good about it . <unk> miles : 10 : 20,000 -- <unk> <unk> : 10 <unk> <unk> , they may be <unk> .
So there are three basic problems , they may be <unk> , and that &apos;s what you need to do .
The next three of five are <unk> .
It &apos;s those <unk> <unk> , who are <unk> .
And so they were -- although it &apos;s great , they don &apos;t have a <unk> .
One is that <unk> , which is the <unk> that allow that technology dramatically dramatically .
This is <unk> , you have heard of many <unk> , <unk> <unk> as a regular force .
And that &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s not going to be the entire day , it doesn &apos;t look at the entire day , it doesn &apos;t get a little bit of a day , and that &apos;s always a <unk> .
And so you need to be , when you need that <unk> , you have a <unk> , which is that you can &apos;t be <unk> .
And so this is a big <unk> . And so we &apos;re concerned with that . And when we say that those <unk> are left out of land , you don &apos;t need any of that technology , you don &apos;t need to deal with that .
And it &apos;s <unk> .
And to show that dimensie , I &apos;ve made all the kinds of <unk> , which were <unk> , <unk> , computer , computer , <unk> , <unk> , for everything . And so that , I &apos;d be able to use that , all the <unk> that the world are , for example , that we were able to create , in fact , that all the <unk> , that we were able to create a <unk> , which was that we were able to produce , less than 10 minutes of <unk> could .
So we &apos;ve got a big <unk> , which is something that we &apos;re going to make a factor of 100 better than that <unk> .
It &apos;s not that that &apos;s not easy .
And this is what we &apos;re going to do , when you try and look at that <unk> <unk> about 20 percent -- 30 percent of <unk> .
If you go to 100 percent , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , you have a <unk> <unk> .
So , where are we going to go to that ?
One of Manhattan was called ? Who are we going to go ?
The other thing that we &apos;ve been talking about are many <unk> , they &apos;re working .
In each one of those five places , we are at least 100 people .
In many ways , you say , they &apos;re <unk> ! That &apos;s OK .
I think , here in the TED group , there are many , many , that you &apos;ve been doing .
Bill <unk> has multiple <unk> , including <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in tientallen countries that made great stuff and <unk> and <unk> and I hope to help .
Nathan <unk> , and I was training a <unk> , and I was <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
There are some innovaties in <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> .
And that <unk> has been in this industry for a long period of time , which is not quite sure that some of our <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is that you would be able to <unk> in a sense of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> , we decided to <unk> that 99 percent .
It &apos;s a pretty <unk> concept .
But yet , you know , well , you know , so you could have done long , but you can &apos;t solve <unk> , but they &apos;ve been doing modern <unk> , you can go and see , &quot; Yes ! <unk> .
And because you get to the 99 percent , that <unk> are really much better .
In fact , there are a little bit of that , and you can actually see that , and you can actually see the <unk> of global <unk> as <unk> .
In other words , there are just to <unk> you , <unk> it .
The <unk> <unk> uses a bit like a <unk> .
And you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
It lost that <unk> .
Here &apos;s a picture in Kentucky .
This is the <unk> , which is 99 percent .
The <unk> that U.S . <unk> .
And then , when you have <unk> <unk> and <unk> , you get genoeg <unk> to the rest of the globe .
You know , it &apos;s going to be a lot of uitdagingen , but it is one more number of examples that we need to deal with lots of <unk> that we need to get to happen .
Think of that , who we get to get our lives .
Who would look like this ?
Well , we &apos;ve got to go to a point where we &apos;ve got to get that <unk> and then we have no more <unk> .
So many of you are talking about 80 percent of a 80 percent .
It &apos;s really important that we &apos;re going to figure out .
The rest of 20 percent are in poor countries in poor countries , and they have no health , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> <unk> and cement down to see .
So , in order to get rid of this 80 percent , you have to <unk> that <unk> , including China who , their <unk> <unk> .
And those other signs is saying , of course , we use that <unk> technology , of course , in all <unk> countries in all of us , and we &apos;re looking at that .
It &apos;s super important .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
So , when we go back here , who are going to be able to figure out that ?
It would be <unk> those two creatures .
We &apos;d be able to use that <unk> <unk> , we have to <unk> the way that we were <unk> , and the <unk> that are <unk> that <unk> are <unk> and that are the poor .
But in fact , this is the point of that stuff that we are doing that stuff that doesn &apos;t have to go into that big <unk> , but it &apos;s actually even more likely to make something more important to that that those other , those who are <unk> that those are <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> with <unk> and we can meet : <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
There are many great boeken to look at that .
The Al Gore says , &quot; We &apos;ve got that choice and David <unk> &quot; <unk> Energy <unk> . &quot;
You can get it into something , and you create a model , in that context , because we need to deal with <unk> all of all of us .
There are some <unk> that are <unk> .
It &apos;s a wens .
And that &apos;s a very <unk> wens that we can create .
And then , if you give me a doctor &apos;s next 50 years , I could be able to offer that a vaccine , and that kind of thing , and I think , of course , would be <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
This is what the biggest impact does .
And when we can &apos;t get that <unk> , it becomes <unk> between <unk> and <unk> <unk> people in the United States and China , between poor and rijke <unk> and fast every single life of that two billion dollars .
So what are we going to do ?
I mean , for that <unk> <unk> ?
We &apos;ve got to <unk> <unk> .
When they were <unk> in places like <unk> , they don &apos;t have to talk about CO2 .
You &apos;d be able to talk about that <unk> <unk> and you &apos;d be <unk> by that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We need <unk> , carbon dioxide , <unk> <unk> that is <unk> .
We have to increase that nieuws .
We have to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and those things that were doing that , they were doing that .
It &apos;s a <unk> wens , but I think we can leave it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you very much . A to <unk> a lot of <unk> -- <unk> , can you get a sense of <unk> ?
Bill Gates : There are those simulatie on a supercomputer , all the time , all the time , we &apos;ve got some big <unk> , and then when we test our <unk> <unk> , we have to test for a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> step is making the first <unk> <unk> , other miljarden dollars , which are <unk> and the place of the first time .
And then the next step is , when it comes to <unk> , then it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , because that <unk> , that <unk> is so different that we know .
CA : So , to understand that right , that &apos;s going to go to see that , you know , that &apos;s going to go into the ground , you know , in the ground , that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , this <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s going to go out and go further down and go down and go down and go down .
BG : Right . So today , you have to <unk> that <unk> <unk> , you know , many people and lots of <unk> , they can be <unk> . This is a little <unk> , and that &apos;s not good .
But then , you know , when you have a <unk> <unk> , you can <unk> it for 60 years -- and you think that you were <unk> , you know , that you were <unk> , and they were <unk> that geese .
And it was here , and it was 60 years long and it was done .
CA : A <unk> , which is a big deal for that .
BG : Yeah . And so , what he did is he said , well , you can put it down , and you can put it down -- it is a little bit less <unk> with this <unk> -- then you take it , and then <unk> it into the next <unk> and verbranden it .
And we start , by the way , we start doing that <unk> , which is already in that <unk> of <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
So , this was a problem that was a problem , which was that we were in our <unk> , and then it becomes <unk> dramatically in that proces .
CA : But in fact , when you have a couple of people in that world , that you have to talk about that that &apos;s what you &apos;ve talked about .
And where is that great <unk> , so that &apos;s really <unk> ?
BG : Well , we don &apos;t have a place , and we have a lot more interesting <unk> for everything that &apos;s <unk> in <unk> , and that &apos;s really important in that <unk> in Rusland , India , China -- I was here , and I was here , and I was here , and I heard that <unk> , and I was talking about that , and I was talking about that , who , who was that , who was that , who are <unk> .
I &apos;m optimistic , you know , that the French and the <unk> are in that direction .
This is another form of one thing that was done .
And it &apos;s a <unk> step , but it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> and some of those countries , which is this one , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> for us first .
CA : So , in your sense , <unk> and likely to make a difference in life ?
BG : Well , we &apos;ve got some <unk> , <unk> things that are very <unk> , we have 20 years to <unk> 20 years to <unk> and 20 years to <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> that we see that <unk> that <unk> is that we have <unk> .
And , you know , <unk> , when everything is <unk> , and that &apos;s a big wens , it could keep that easy .
And in fact , it has been able to be 200 of <unk> , and we don &apos;t need honderden , even when their <unk> works , that would be <unk> for their <unk> .
And it would be great , and then you could have a <unk> .
In any case , we have a problem .
CA : <unk> the big <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> that you know ?
BG : A <unk> is <unk> .
It could be that <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s really important .
In <unk> , there is other <unk> <unk> .
You know , we don &apos;t know , we know what this is because of what this is , but this is <unk> <unk> , that is a different way .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is a little bit more difficult , but maybe that &apos;s what we think about .
And so there is some other , but the beautiful thing is that a <unk> has a big amount of energy , who is a <unk> , and therefore , as you can see , when you have that problem , they &apos;re <unk> , and that &apos;s the cost , and the cost , that the <unk> , and other things in that land , and other things , in a <unk> .
CA : If that wasn &apos;t <unk> , then ?
Do we have <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ?
BG : In this situation , when you get to <unk> , you know , you know , when you have a <unk> , you know , you know ?
There is a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> that set up with diverse technieken to <unk> that there are 20 , 20 years to spend 20 years of <unk> .
It &apos;s just a <unk> .
We hope that we don &apos;t save that .
Some of you say , you don &apos;t have to go back to the <unk> , you know , you know , a little <unk> , you know , you know , a little <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a little <unk> , you know , you know , you know , a little <unk> , you know ?
I don &apos;t know , of course , when you think that that &apos;s not that important to this issue that makes that interest in mind , but we have a dialogue in <unk> that you have to have to have to have that <unk> , for that matter , that things are getting sneller from that .
CA : Do you have one of these , you know , you can get one of two zinnen for that ?
BG : Well , you know , leader in <unk> , in all kinds of <unk> .
And those of you who are <unk> , are very <unk> .
Do they say that it &apos;s a negatieve impact that does have to do that ?
And it &apos;s very , very few things , which is they can say , of course , they can tell you about that .
The <unk> here is so similar to AIDS .
You know , that &apos;s <unk> , and you give you a little bit later .
And so that , then , in fact , when you have all of the other <unk> problems in doing something , you know , from a man who was later -- and that &apos;s going to be <unk> that the investering isn &apos;t so clear that the 20th century is not worth the worst scenario , and they say that there are people in the <unk> world and say , okay , that &apos;s not .
The reason is that this act of being able to do that .
But my dream is that , when I think that , then , when you can see that , when the CO2 is <unk> , then you can say that , &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not interested in that <unk> , I wish I wanted to be <unk> , but I &apos;m not necessarily sure that it &apos;s <unk> , but I &apos;m not necessarily sure that it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
CA : So that would be the <unk> <unk> argument that , when we were doing all the time , you use the <unk> to solve the CO2 issue , all the other doelen , that <unk> <unk> , that are <unk> <unk> , that are <unk> <unk> , money , money , money , that we have to do .
BG : And that &apos;s the real cost for that research -- say that we should be 10 billion dollars worth of 10 dollars per year , that &apos;s not true .
There are other things to do that .
You get to get a big <unk> , and here , you can have a <unk> of <unk> , and you have to <unk> that .
So , I think , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I mean , you know , I mean , you know , I mean , you know , I mean , you know , I mean , you know , a <unk> of <unk> and money , I think that &apos;s <unk> .
As a <unk> , you get a very <unk> <unk> , you can see only those <unk> .
I mean , all of you may be able to get five minutes to make a lot of us , not to change our lives .
So for that lower number of two billion , it &apos;s a ramp .
And to think about <unk> .
The other thing is that there is , &quot; Waarom is that <unk> ? &quot;
There is still , for sure , there are some of the previous stories , but there &apos;s an <unk> <unk> , but there &apos;s an <unk> group , and that &apos;s where there &apos;s this <unk> .
And that &apos;s a <unk> that I think I think I need to <unk> .
And that studies , it &apos;s <unk> , who are not <unk> .
CA : Bill , I think I &apos;m going to talk to a lot of people here , and I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m not sure that your wens is going to be true .
BG : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what I &apos;d say about , a couple of that is a couple of cases when I was writing a little bit of a <unk> magazine .
I used to write my <unk> <unk> <unk> , but I was done with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and it was that I thought that I had no <unk> in my life .
I read it to you .
&quot; <unk> , <unk> : &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk>
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
I had a set of <unk> <unk> , and I was able to smile as well as <unk> , but it was <unk> , but I wasn &apos;t able to <unk> and couldn &apos;t afford to read and couldn &apos;t afford to read and take me out of that <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
Of course , that was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I thought that that would be quite <unk> .
But in fact , it was a list of <unk> in the early &apos; 80s , when I started working on the basisschool , and then I started working , my <unk> left in front of my <unk> <unk> and to form other <unk> and to various other things .
And God is not <unk> a <unk> .
I mean , in a world , I would be born in a world of a world , which is someone who might be like someone who might be like a person who might be <unk> in <unk> , but then I &apos;m going to be able to see that day , but I &apos;m going to have that day .
And so I did immediately get that <unk> from 2009 , and I &apos;d verwacht that I &apos;d think that I think a <unk> piece of paper .
Here &apos;s the <unk> versie of that <unk> .
<unk> is not much better .
And in fact , in fact , I think there are two <unk> of <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; .
But it &apos;s not just that words .
And that &apos;s what we think about that , which we think of that sound that we write with these words .
It &apos;s about that <unk> , which is in this words , and who we &apos;re <unk> .
We have that kind of <unk> our thinking , and who we think that world and humans around us .
In fact , many <unk> samenlevingen , including the Grieken , and the <unk> <unk> , have been believed that that <unk> was a big force , because that was <unk> <unk> .
So , what are we going to <unk> <unk> -- a <unk> of <unk> people ?
In fact , one of a sudden , a <unk> <unk> like <unk> , could <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
Is it a little <unk> , you get a <unk> <unk> ?
A person , a <unk> <unk> , was my <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
There is a <unk> <unk> . A <unk> , whose name is the most Americans who didn &apos;t even correct that most Americans were <unk> . And there was only a <unk> <unk> .
And Dr . <unk> used to <unk> <unk> , and was that kind of <unk> <unk> , and was that kind of <unk> .
I found that in that ziekenhuis , I put it in that ziekenhuis , I got a little <unk> .
I &apos;d be <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in a <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;ve been able to <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> . I <unk> .
And then , you know , I &apos;d like to do something like <unk> kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and so it &apos;s <unk> to stop <unk> <unk> .
And once a day , there was me in a mine -- this <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- and there was to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you know , you know , <unk> , you know , <unk> and <unk> young children , you start a <unk> <unk> .
And then , when you were <unk> , I would give you 100 dollars . &quot;
And that was just a little <unk> from Dr . <unk> , which I &apos;m not trying to do that oefeningen that I didn &apos;t have to do , with that <unk> <unk> children in that kind of <unk> girl in <unk> <unk> , but there was actually <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
And I ask myself today , who are really aware of my view of me as a <unk> and <unk> weeks of <unk> <unk> , and I have to be able to do that , like a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
This is one more like many , who are <unk> in <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
But who is <unk> <unk> that we can bewijzen that <unk> is not going to be able to create a new space , we can imagine something that we were going to do all of the other individuals in order to do that .
The other way that our <unk> are <unk> that we were <unk> that in many ways of doing that in many ways , they were <unk> .
So , from <unk> <unk> , you can say that my benen , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> from Titan and <unk> <unk> for <unk> body , that people are able to make people , and they don &apos;t care about that <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> their <unk> <unk> , and they allow you to be able to have to be able to have a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , people in <unk> form .
And they spend a big deal of <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> .
And so you have a <unk> of that technological <unk> , because you know , it was only a different truth , which is that every single person in which a <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and that that <unk> are able to change that <unk> <unk> .
The other way that there are a lot of people -- that &apos;s a interesting story , because people who teach me to teach me more to <unk> , and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit to me , and I &apos;m not quite sure that I felt like that , and I think , I think , I think , I think , that <unk> are <unk> , and I think , I think , that &apos;s <unk> .
And so this set of things that kind of <unk> live in that sense of <unk> that success , or happiness or <unk> a challenge , or <unk> a big <unk> , and if my life were so successful that my life were so successful , because I &apos;d be able to make a <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
But the truth is that we &apos;re going to make us . So , yes , we &apos;re going to make that <unk> , in fact , of course , in order to <unk> , emotioneel <unk> .
And I think that &apos;s good .
<unk> are not <unk> that we were <unk> to get <unk> to our lives .
<unk> are really <unk> .
And I &apos;m <unk> , <unk> like my schaduwen .
In fact , I think there are a little bit of <unk> there , and I think there are very little <unk> there , but there &apos;s nothing for me .
And I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of that , which is that the impact of that balance on <unk> are <unk> .
And they &apos;re <unk> and uitdagingen , and they &apos;re only <unk> real , and they &apos;re trying to figure out , but that &apos;s not because of that question , but that question is not about <unk> <unk> , but we &apos;re looking at that .
And so we &apos;re not just <unk> that people who we love , we are <unk> to <unk> , but they &apos;re looking for <unk> .
And we &apos;re not paying attention to our <unk> , when we give them a sense of that they can &apos;t relate to .
You know , I think there are two things to <unk> , which is to be <unk> and <unk> to others , and to others that , of course , of course , not .
And for sure , that &apos;s true , that the single true and <unk> handicap that I &apos;ve been able to do , to me , is that the world will always say that those world are always <unk> .
In our doctor &apos;s <unk> , who lives in our <unk> , and those of you who are <unk> , good response to their <unk> <unk> , are able to give rise to the <unk> <unk> , that they &apos;d be <unk> that we &apos;re not going to make that <unk> .
The <unk> concept is that just <unk> , it was <unk> in a little bit , and we &apos;d be able to figure out , for each other kind of different handicap like that .
If we were not <unk> <unk> , and not all of its power and <unk> and recognize that we &apos;re going to make sure that we have to go to the natural conflict , they may be <unk> .
We <unk> a lot of people who are in our <unk> .
So we &apos;ve got to look at that <unk> <unk> and all of us to focus on the planet .
The <unk> , but it &apos;s not that the perception of our <unk> and our <unk> <unk> .
We should not be <unk> that <unk> days of <unk> , we should not have to solve that <unk> , we &apos;d be able to <unk> them , but it &apos;s going to be able to get into the <unk> .
And I think there &apos;s a little bit more obvious that we don &apos;t have to address that , but I think we &apos;re <unk> to <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> to <unk> and <unk> .
And I think we &apos;d be able to do that , <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and feel like they &apos;re not so <unk> .
In this year , we launched 200 years of Charles Darwin , and if there was 150 years over over evolutie , Darwin has Darwin , in my sense , in my view , in a <unk> in our <unk> .
I &apos;d like to <unk> that , not the greatest of its <unk> , and it &apos;s not that <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s not true that you can see the impact on the best .
And for that , in <unk> , creativiteit does have .
Not just from Darwin , we know that that means that the potential of humans , and <unk> , or <unk> , by the conflict of human spirit is <unk> .
And so , again , there are <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> .
And we know , from that , we know , from <unk> , when we were <unk> <unk> , when we were <unk> .
One is that kind of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , is a sense of <unk> .
We can give you something to pay attention .
We can give rise to a more important Bedeutung , which is that we have to be <unk> .
And maybe we can see <unk> as a change .
<unk> are a difference where we haven &apos;t created that .
I think the biggest <unk> that we have to <unk> us , is to think that we &apos;re going to be normal .
<unk> -- wie is the normal ?
It &apos;s not <unk> .
I think this is <unk> . The <unk> , but not that <unk> . And then you &apos;d know this poor , grijze <unk> , what do they know ?
I think , rather than not .
The other thing is , when we go to this model of <unk> to a different <unk> of <unk> , and it might be a little bit of gevaarlijk <unk> , which is the power of <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> it , and they <unk> that , they <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> found out that we had a lot of <unk> that we &apos;ve always made people in our <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And so he said that he has been able to argue that today that economists have oudere <unk> and people met <unk> and humans have been able to have that <unk> <unk> and that he did , because that <unk> in <unk> <unk> for that <unk> in that country , they were <unk> in that <unk> .
They were not like that <unk> and <unk> , they were <unk> and <unk> .
A couple of years ago , I was living in the town , in a <unk> , in a <unk> , in the &quot; Red Zone &quot; at Pennsylvania , and I was standing here for a <unk> tomaten .
It was zomer , and I had <unk> .
And I know , who is a guy who says , &quot; Well , after all , that &apos;s not Aimee <unk> . &quot;
And I was <unk> , and I see this oudere man , and I had no idea of what there was .
And I &apos;d say , &quot; Sorry , Sir , I don &apos;t know ? I can &apos;t tell you . &quot;
And there was to say , &quot; Well , you don &apos;t know .
When I was looking at the first time , I &apos;d come to you , you know , from your mom . &quot;
Oh , so .
And they were <unk> .
This was Dr . <unk> , a man , I know , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , just a man who was five year-old on this room , because I &apos;d be sure that I &apos;d say that , in fact , that I &apos;d say , oh , I &apos;d say that , in fact , that I &apos;d say that , in fact
The arts for <unk> <unk> my mom was at a vakantie , and I didn &apos;t know what my mother was , which was not .
And because I was born with <unk> , and my <unk> , and I was just a few tenen , and I was just a few tenen of the other than there was the <unk> , that was <unk> that the other day was <unk> .
I said to me , &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; Well , I &apos;d say to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;d like to leave you a little bit of that , and I &apos;d like to <unk> that other kids from who else can &apos;t live .
In fact , I felt that there was a <unk> <unk> of my <unk> , which was , of course , from a <unk> in the next morning , I &apos;d be <unk> with that <unk> on <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> from <unk> Medical School and <unk> <unk> Medical School and <unk> Medical School and <unk> Medical School and <unk> Medical School and <unk> Medical School .
And there was this part of his <unk> , which is the X factor of human <unk> .
You can just say , well , that &apos;s not enough to look at that .
And Dr . <unk> was <unk> , and said , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve learned that kids , when they were not a little bit of something else , and if they were a little bit of <unk> , then they were <unk> a little bit more . &quot;
Let &apos;s see , I think Dr . <unk> .
There were all of the <unk> diagnose , and who was someone who was able to do that , two different things .
And so I had an idea of my mind in the loop of the day , when they asked me to be 10 years ago , from 15 years ago , from my <unk> and <unk> <unk> , then I had no <unk> .
I wanted to get a better job .
If you ask me that I &apos;m not so .
And that &apos;s what I did , which is <unk> <unk> and not <unk> that experience .
And maybe this is going to be able to figure out what this is going to happen to me , because I &apos;d be a lot of people in that <unk> , in other words , in other words , who wanted me to figure out that .
Let &apos;s see , there &apos;s really a lot of people , you know , you can tell you , you can tell you , you know , you can get your power <unk> .
And when you put it to somebody , there are some of you , the more powerful power -- the human spirit is so <unk> -- when you get it , and for somebody else , you get to get a look at somebody , you get to get a big <unk> .
You put them into <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s the question of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the words of <unk> .
It means , you know , a lot of them , in a way , that &apos;s <unk> .
In fact , how are we going to be able to do that ?
In the 1960s today , a <unk> in the U.K . <unk> happened in <unk> <unk> .
And you call it &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the U.S . <unk> .
Those students were <unk> <unk> .
And those A students were <unk> <unk> <unk> , they &apos;d get better <unk> up and that are better teachers .
You know , you know , you have to spend a <unk> period of school students with a &quot; <unk> &quot; which is <unk> . She &apos;d say that they were <unk> , they were <unk> that they were <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s <unk> to hear a little bit of hard to hear that vice versa .
And that was when it was going to go to three <unk> .
But just like that , they were in school -- at least in school , those who were <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s what I think that was important in that experiment was that those kids were not <unk> .
And those of you who didn &apos;t know about that is what was happening .
You know , you know , you know , that &apos;s <unk> that <unk> and those who are willing to be <unk> and <unk> . And they have something like that .
The single true handicap is a <unk> spirit , which is a sense of <unk> , which is not <unk> . There doesn &apos;t exist much more <unk> . There doesn &apos;t exist as much <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and our <unk> <unk> .
The other thing that we create , is to <unk> the human spirit to hope , and other people are able to figure out and other people to figure out , nieuwsgierig and <unk> to make our power .
As a sense of <unk> , we can have a new <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;d like to eindigen with a poem that was written by a <unk> <unk> in 14 <unk> who told me that my friend Jacques <unk> told me , &quot; The God , &quot; which is <unk> God , not by God , not by God , not the God <unk> , but by God , not the God of the <unk> , but it says , &quot; Hey <unk> . &quot;
Come on , <unk> with me . Thank you .
