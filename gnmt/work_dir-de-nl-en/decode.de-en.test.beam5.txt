A few years ago , here at TED , Peter <unk> called Peter <unk> ,
That &apos;s really simply , it &apos;s really easy . <unk> that <unk> connected to the <unk> of 20 spaghetti sauce , just by <unk> tape and a marshmallow ,
The marshmallow is on top .
and , hoewel it really is really really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really hard , when it comes to people really hard .
and I thought that this is a really interesting sense , and I got it into a <unk> .
It was a massive ,
So , now , I &apos;ve done a 70 workshops , and I &apos;ve done students in the world of students , <unk> and architect , and that &apos;s when I had to talk about <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s what some of these things , and I &apos;m going to share some of these things ,
So typically , that &apos;s typically what those people are doing for their job .
and they think about it , they think that they &apos;re going to see , it <unk> for power .
I spend a little bit of time in design and an NGO , and he <unk> spaghetti sauce .
They spend a lot of their time in the developing world in the constant landscape .
and , before she goes , it takes a lot of time , and it takes an end of the marshmallow , and he put it on top of the marshmallow , a little bit of it , and &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
But , if you go , it &apos;s almost always going to happen , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is an <unk> , which is that it <unk> the weight of the <unk> , and it <unk> .
and it &apos;s a series of people who have a lot of more or less , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
They don &apos;t liegen , it &apos;s one of them , and they &apos;re in the war .
and indeed , teams also have a lot of more <unk> that have <unk> , and that &apos;s the best <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
and it &apos;s really amazing .
who told us , Peter , who didn &apos;t , but that most of the red torens , but the most interesting ones all of them .
What they &apos;re going to ask is : &quot; How did it do it ? Why ? &quot;
and Peter says , &quot; <unk> , that &apos;s the kind of children who spend the <unk> of spaghetti <unk> . &quot;
Not a time in <unk> .
He &apos;s another one of another .
And that <unk> was training , which is a real plan , OK !
and then we &apos;ll see it .
What if , when they go on , when they put the marshmallow up on those top , they didn &apos;t have a time and what ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
<unk> , was was ?
But what <unk> is that they have begun to do with the marshmallow and prototypes , and they prototypes , and they &apos;re going to have the marshmallow on the top of the top , and they &apos;re more likely to <unk> prototypes .
This is that Art of samenwerking of samenwerking as an area of an <unk> <unk> .
and that kind of test that kind of was that kind of feedback , and it didn &apos;t work .
And that is that change , we &apos;ve been working with prototypes , which is almost , but we can see that different teams .
And the bulk of that , for an <unk> , 50 percent , <unk> , politicians , but not a lot of that , but not a lot of , <unk> are more likely to be better .
So , how is the largest human ?
architecten and engineering ,
<unk> is that I &apos;ve seen it .
and what ? Because they want to understand driehoeken and <unk> geometric patronen ,
A lot of managers lying around . But here , it &apos;s interesting .
In the team , if you go into the team of team , they became significant better .
It &apos;s really amazing . They can see and recognize &quot; This team will winnen . &quot;
you can guess what ?
and that they <unk> their own abilities .
and they take the proces , they understand it .
and that team , and that &apos;s going to affect that job , and that &apos;s going to change that team of teams ,
<unk> , <unk> , and they &apos;re going to lead to success .
So , if you have 10 teams , that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do , and they &apos;re going to have six , and they &apos;re <unk> .
So I took a little bit of <unk> .
I thought , let &apos;s go ahead .
So , I had a $ <unk> $ <unk> of software for that bet .
What did you think about this <unk> ?
What was that ?
This was happening . There was a team that was a <unk> .
So , if you &apos;ve got to have a <unk> nonprofit job , I had to have that award for them .
Now , is it not interesting , really interesting , really good effect ?
We made a reverse change in our teaching students .
What did you know ?
and now you know it was an <unk> .
And that &apos;s become a good team of one that was one of the best .
and they put those giant parts into the bottom .
and it &apos;s <unk> lessons for us , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done about that .
and they &apos;ll ask : &quot; Well , why does somebody spend a lot of time going to change ?
And this is , I &apos;ve got to help digital tools and processen , for teams , games , games , &quot; Visual <unk> . &quot;
And it was that <unk> <unk> , they help them explain to you .
All of the time , every project has its own marshmallow .
And that challenge is a common sense , which is a common language , and it &apos;s <unk> , the real prototype .
and that &apos;s the point of view that this is just a long time .
And those of you who are studying , you can go to school .
It &apos;s a blog , where you see , who are the <unk> .
He &apos;s a <unk> .
And you can play rare voorbeelden of all over the world , who are the people who build a model and they <unk> .
He &apos;s also <unk> .
And that basic thing that I think is a <unk> sport .
And it requires that we focus all our focus on that goal , and , we think , that we &apos;re perfect , who our language and our actions , in the face of the uitdaging , who are facing us .
And maybe a little bit of a small prototype of this ervaring , and it was a &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is a &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and it could make a big difference .
Thank you .
If we did , if we had a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and it &apos;s a tijdmachine .
and every one of these things ,
and you can go into that verleden , you can go into that toekomst , you can go to the back and stay here .
and I ask me , what I &apos;m going to do was that I was going to kiezen , because I had a lot of my vrienden at the time , and they wanted to go into that verleden .
I don &apos;t know . In that case , I went back to the <unk> of the auto of Twitter , Twitter of America , &quot; America . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m really afraid that we cut into a <unk> , <unk> .
and I snap it .
I &apos;m not a part of this team , I can say .
I don &apos;t want to go into that verleden , and it doesn &apos;t want me to be a <unk> .
And it &apos;s not going to come up with that opportunity at the planeet , they go back to that .
I &apos;m going to go into this machine , and I go into that future .
This is that one of the greatest moments that he was , he was able to change it on this planeet , or , for example , gezondheid , <unk> , mobiliteit , <unk> .
He was never before that .
My <unk> was they lost 60 .
And my grootouders are <unk> .
My ouders are 80 .
I mean , it was a nine at a close to my <unk> .
But it &apos;s not even people who want us , want this is one of them .
A kind of kind of child who was born in New Delhi , it &apos;s going to live in New York City for 100 years .
Think about it . It &apos;s a remarkable thing .
and why is it that ?
The pokken , those pokken , have been killed miljarden people on this planeet .
and they have a new <unk> of the Earth that didn &apos;t have an <unk> .
They &apos;re gone . They are .
We &apos;ve got them <unk> . <unk> .
In the poor world , ziekten , which are , for millions of us , have been going to have a <unk> , not yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
I think someone else was , what ?
<unk> , modern medicine , our vermogen , miljarden people , that have been <unk> .
And my view of my view is that the wetenschappelijke methode , <unk> , look , of course , if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the great challenges of the mensheid .
This is a good news .
But it &apos;s very good news , want it &apos;s a few other things , and they were very different .
and one of them is , when all of our achievements , a million people at the time , every single one of the people at the time .
And that &apos;s where it gets , and she gets very hard , and it &apos;s <unk> .
and it &apos;s not just that , we &apos;ve got a lot of our verbeelding that we used to have been doing ,
drinkwater , <unk> land , regenwouden , gas , gas , of course , of course , and when we don &apos;t consider the chaos of chaos , we don &apos;t let it .
And that question is : Can we do it ? I think .
I mean , I think it &apos;s a lot of people , which we can make crops , which is going to have miljard people , without the land , that they are going to be in the country ,
I think , I think , we can take the world for energy , which they can &apos;t hurt .
I think it really , and it &apos;s not a <unk> .
But it keeps me going to live at night -- one of the things that I â€™ m going to say is that I am going to stay at night .
and we were not able to date it , we don &apos;t want to date it .
We are at the level of a remarkable , remarkable thing in Africa , and yet , I think that we &apos;ve been able to have honderden , 300 years before that opportunity for us to go back to a moment , in that case , in that case , we &apos;ve been talking about vooruitgang for a lot of things that we &apos;ve been talking about , which we &apos;ve been talking about <unk> <unk> , that we &apos;ve heard about it .
and those people who come into their belief , and that &apos;s really scary when they can &apos;t fix them .
They don &apos;t want that story ,
and I mean , you know , every one of the things that comes to you when it comes to their mind , and that &apos;s when you think about it , you know ,
I mean , no , no .
They don &apos;t own their own feiten . &quot; <unk> , they don &apos;t .
and I took a long time to figure out .
A decennium geleden had I read an article about <unk> for &quot; The New Yorker &quot; , a small papers .
and I was verbaasd that I was up to the <unk> that was going on to me , that was when I was going to see that most effective was going to be that most effective <unk> in health in health care ,
I didn &apos;t know what I was going to do , and I got a piece of it , and I had a piece of paper , and I had a piece of paper .
And I went there and I had a piece of papers called <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s very similar .
that people were screaming .
And I had a piece that I had geschreven about a papers , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why those guys thought that they thought that molecules were going to <unk> in a way that was in a different way was a random child in the area of the natural world .
I was , I was doing it . I schreef the papers , I went .
I was an journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to go , we &apos;re going to make a go , we &apos;re going to go .
But this papers made me feel , and I couldn &apos;t figure out , and I couldn &apos;t figure out ,
And that &apos;s when that <unk> , that <unk> , who made me crazy , didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
These were <unk> people , <unk> people , <unk> people .
They were who those guys in this room .
and it <unk> me ,
But I thought , you know , what we said was , if we were , we were pretty much .
So , we have a moment , where we don &apos;t even have that relative ratio that we &apos;ve done that .
So we <unk> .
So we drove ironic , and we said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s not what happens . &quot;
Okay , and I think , of course , some of those redenen , and I think we know ,
So , we &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> in partnership with gezag , and sometimes in that way in that science , and he doesn &apos;t want it .
I mean , you might call a bunch of names and those people are going to be able to understand .
Tsjernobyl , <unk> , that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that <unk> 2000 .
I mean , you can read their own lijst .
<unk> and <unk> , and that &apos;s where we geloofden that they were forever .
So , I want to ask , ask your question , <unk> , desire .
I don &apos;t think it was one .
But now , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Well , when you &apos;ve got bewijs to understand this bewijs , and it &apos;s not good . &quot;
And I can tell you that we now leven in a epidemie of conflict , who I have never seen before and hopelijk never again .
About 12 years ago , a <unk> verhaal , a terrible verhaal , which was that <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> was a <unk> .
Very <unk> .
<unk> studies have been used to see ,
<unk> studies have been done , it &apos;s a serious event .
that data came along .
And that data came out of the Verenigde Staten , in England , of Zweden , of Canada , and they were all common , no , no , no .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference . It &apos;s not a difference , want we think of data , we think , what we see is , what we see is that we really feel .
We don &apos;t think a set of paper or a <unk> data , that data I think , I think , we do it .
But remember , what ?
And that was <unk> .
<unk> , for example , that U.S. land is one of the countries in the world , in which that land <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and we &apos;ll be <unk> .
It &apos;s really bad .
But what &apos;s going on is that we could do it .
I snap it . I &apos;m doing it .
So , there &apos;s a guy who got here , right ?
Hat one another in an audience that you see someone who was going to be <unk> ?
Not very vaak .
<unk> in this country , but in fact , <unk> in the world at the same time .
This is a lot of the <unk> , 20 per uur .
But that &apos;s not going to be happening here , and it &apos;s not going to be that way , and people who are Jenny , and they &apos;re going to be able to figure out how to go to <unk> and send messages from <unk> who Oprah and Larry King live .
and they can do it , because they don &apos;t connect and engage and connect .
and they don &apos;t understand that they are being <unk> , but they don &apos;t have the <unk> .
and it &apos;s something that we &apos;ve got to learn , and that &apos;s very even .
This was a held , Jonas Salk .
There are some of the most evil <unk> of human beings .
No fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
This guy doesn &apos;t really .
There is Paul <unk> .
There are a few other people who &apos;ve done some of the other people who &apos;ve been doing it .
There are those <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
Pretty good , right ?
Now , it &apos;s good , afgezien of , that Paul <unk> and talking about vaccins , and they say , who they are , and they say that those people are driving .
and it says it really .
Paul is a terrorist .
As Paul in a openbaar <unk> , it doesn &apos;t mean to have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There are a few comments , because they want to tell him that they tell us where his children go to school .
and , why ? Because Paul had a vaccine .
I don &apos;t want to say that , but vaccins are <unk> .
And when they go through those ziekten , we have those ziekten , the ziekten , and it &apos;s happening .
We &apos;ve got <unk> in the country .
And it &apos;s going to be more likely , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit more likely to happen , and it &apos;s just going to be a question of the cijfers .
and they don &apos;t have any <unk> .
So , what about <unk> ?
And one of the things that I wrote about a couple of weken ago , and told me she was a little bit more <unk> .
Nobody was telling you .
She wouldn &apos;t kill her .
<unk> .
Why ? Because we didn &apos;t have a <unk> . And what ?
We didn &apos;t have any <unk> in the country .
Now , I don &apos;t know , maybe I was going to go to a man in Lagos , in a vliegtuig , and in a moment in Los Angeles , in a moment , in a moment , in the Ohio of Ohio .
And in a few uur , it comes to a car , and it comes to a car , and it comes to Long Beach , and it comes to Long Beach , and it &apos;s going to go to a <unk> <unk> .
and it doesn &apos;t know that there &apos;s a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , it doesn &apos;t matter , want it &apos;s still the world .
This is the planeet where we live .
We &apos;re going to love it , we &apos;re going to love ourselves .
So , I mean , all of the morning , all the <unk> ?
<unk> , of course , a little <unk> , which is one of those steps .
I &apos;m sure that you &apos;ve done that , because that helft of the Amerikanen ,
They take that spul , and they go to alternatieve treatment , and they don &apos;t know , who are the power , and they don &apos;t know how to fix them .
and that data revealed that they &apos;ve been <unk> .
They <unk> your urine . They don &apos;t .
It &apos;s okay , you go to 28 miljard dollars for the donkere urine .
I &apos;m absolutely sorry .
<unk> urine . Bad .
So , why do we do it ?
Now , I think , I &apos;m going to do that -- we haten that farmaceutische .
we don &apos;t have a good response . We don &apos;t have a vertrouwen in the system .
and we don &apos;t want it . Our <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to miljoenen people .
It &apos;s really incredible , and it &apos;s really incredible incredible and <unk> ourselves ,
We go away from the road , and where do we do that ?
We run in those poor countries .
It &apos;s great . I love that <unk> .
But , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing , because it &apos;s crap , and we &apos;ll make miljarden dollars .
and I got all the little little <unk> here .
<unk> , <unk> , bedrog , <unk> , <unk> , I don &apos;t even know , but we can say miljarden dollars , it &apos;s <unk> .
and I mean , when I &apos;m going to say that , when I &apos;m going to say that I &apos;m going to say that people are going to go , and say , &quot; Wat do you want ? Laat those people have been doing it .
And they feel good . &quot;
and know , I mean , you have <unk> .
Now , want it is me , of course , it is my <unk> , which says , &quot; Hmm , I want to say that I &apos;m an argument in my expert , I don &apos;t think of my experts , &quot; of the <unk> that are going to have <unk> .
And when you go back to that pad , where design and magic <unk> , it is going to create a site where you don &apos;t .
They &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> in Zuid-Afrika .
There was 400,000 of his people , because there was a set of <unk> , that rode <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , of antiretroviral drugs that we know about AIDS .
So , for example , like , of course , like , like , like , you know , like every other country in a country , that &apos;s when every other one of the disease <unk> .
Don &apos;t tell me , I don &apos;t want those things .
They &apos;ve got them . They &apos;ve got them .
So , that <unk> epidemie , in whom we &apos;re even standing , it &apos;s a crazy battle between the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> debat . It &apos;s like .
It &apos;s a bit of a discussie over the words ,
It &apos;s not an <unk> .
All of us , every single thing we &apos;re going to eten , every <unk> , every <unk> , was one of the people ,
So , we had no <unk> in a paradijs .
He was not <unk> . He was not <unk> . It was all done .
We &apos;ve done it in the last 11.000 years .
and , and it doesn &apos;t matter , and it doesn &apos;t matter .
We &apos;ve got <unk> , where we didn &apos;t have a job .
And now , we &apos;re able to do it now . Natuurlijk , we &apos;ve got to do it . But we can take a bit of it . But we can do something that releases A in rijst , and it can help miljoenen people , miljoenen people , miljoenen people ,
It doesn &apos;t want to do it ?
I said , I don &apos;t know .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Why do we do it ?
Now , I &apos;ve been watching a lot of chemicaliÃ«n , pesticiden , pesticiden , hormonen , we don &apos;t want to make a big entropy of it . It &apos;s not a big velden that &apos;s onjuist .
We don &apos;t , we don &apos;t want to .
We don &apos;t want to , you know , <unk> .
and , I mean , what was my <unk> ?
Yes , you &apos;ve got right . <unk> we .
It &apos;s where , we have a huge <unk> , but it &apos;s not science .
It doesn &apos;t make science fiction .
It &apos;s Law , moral , <unk> .
that science fiction is not a business .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not a concept ; it &apos;s a process .
This is a process , and it doesn &apos;t get it , and it doesn &apos;t , but that really , it is , that we don &apos;t even plan that science , we get their job , want we are bang to make a real difference , and it takes miljoenen of people who go .
In the next 50 years , 70 percent more agricultural land are going to be 70 percent . 70 percent .
This was in Africa in Africa in the afgelopen 30 jaar .
<unk> . <unk> .
and they &apos;ve got it , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? <unk> <unk> .
We don &apos;t want to change people , we don &apos;t want to try to kill people , who <unk> .
<unk> is one half miljard people .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
It &apos;s just a <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have any of it , it doesn &apos;t have it , it doesn &apos;t have a eiwit , and it &apos;s an architect , and it &apos;s all of that .
and then , those people might not be blind .
They didn &apos;t verhongeren , and they know ?
This is something . It &apos;s not <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s really .
and everything that I could say is : &quot; Waarom do we treat it ?
I mean , ask me , why do we treat it ?
So , we don &apos;t want to go to a genes ?
It &apos;s not that , Gene <unk> . It &apos;s not the chemicaliÃ«n .
And it doesn &apos;t work for our miserable vulnerability to eating a lot of our <unk> , a healthy food , <unk> <unk> .
Now , it doesn &apos;t have to <unk> Rice <unk> , it &apos;s going to go to the <unk> of men , and it &apos;s going to be a real time , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of time ,
I mean , what ?
If we don &apos;t , when we do it , we don &apos;t think that we &apos;re going to , I think , I think , I think , I think , I think , I think , I think I &apos;m not going to be guilty , I think I &apos;m not guilty , you know , at the high-tech kolonialisme ,
He &apos;s not any other beschrijving for this ,
It &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s lelijk , we don &apos;t want it waard .
I mean , when you go to that really funny entertainment entertainment , I want to say , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to ask him in that belachelijke moment and in that future ? &quot;
Anyway , I &apos;m going to go into it every case .
Right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have a huge opportunity .
We can tell all of this <unk> , what we go .
We can <unk> them , where we go to them , where we go to them , and we go to them , where we go .
So we &apos;ve got these gesprekken , and we &apos;ve got to think about it , but when we go into that tijdmachine , and when we go into that tijdmachine , we &apos;re going to be happier .
I &apos;m sure that we can , and for some time it comes to me , this is what that world will have .
Thank you .
When Steve <unk> , the Los Angeles Times , a <unk> of the Los Angeles Times , there was a man in Los Angeles , a fantastic music .
She was a man named a man , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on a viool , who had just two <unk> .
Now , velen of you have heard that geschiedenis , because of the <unk> papers that later was a book , which was a book that was done by Robert <unk> junior , and Steve <unk> was like Steve <unk> , and Jamie <unk> who had <unk> Anthony <unk> , the <unk> <unk> who was going to school , and that <unk> won &apos;t finish his <unk> .
<unk> at Juilliard , an <unk> and 30 years later , there was 30 years later in the straten of East Los Angeles .
I &apos;ll tell you all the words that I want to read and tell you about the film of the film , and it doesn &apos;t really want to understand that fantastic connection between both these two people was born , but that is , who those things that enable them to take those <unk> and who was that instrument , was in the process of <unk> , is that it was that tool , <unk> , <unk> .
So I went to a <unk> in 2008 , two years geleden , in the Walt Disney <unk> Hall .
There was a show of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and I came up with that podium .
There was a <unk> and <unk> sounds like Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton , and that <unk> didn &apos;t go into the baseball World <unk> <unk> , and it won &apos;t go into the baseball World <unk> <unk> , and it was going to go for the <unk> passage in the very last set of speech .
And we went to a lot of people , and a few dagen later , I got a email that I had to have a email that was <unk> for me .
I &apos;ve got to say that <unk> is an old treatment <unk> , want it was going to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , a trauma , that they are still <unk> .
And as a result , it &apos;s going to be really <unk> for these <unk> sequences , which is , of course , that they are still the <unk> of them , and they are <unk> in the straten of <unk> Row , <unk> Row , in the straten of <unk> Row , and in fact , the <unk> of your own soul .
And in fact , it was an <unk> <unk> , when we started out , when we launched our eerste <unk> in the Walt Disney <unk> Hall , there was a <unk> <unk> in his eyes , and it was completely lost .
There was a talk about onzichtbare demonen and rook and whoever it takes to <unk> ,
I was bang , I was not <unk> , but I was bang that I could take it into a <unk> , and I would argue that there might be a <unk> relationship that I had to call <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and other <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was just a second .
I was a set of <unk> <unk> .
and when I was playing , I noticed that in <unk> eyes was a complete change .
It was , if it was going to be affected by a theory of observation , a chemical reactie , that was an <unk> response that my match was .
<unk> <unk> <unk> sense , in a <unk> nieuwsgierigheid and <unk> .
and who was a wonder when a wonder was , and I came back to a couple of clips of <unk> or <unk> and bat me , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
So we began to talk about music , we &apos;re going to start from Bach on Beethoven , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and all the others , <unk> , <unk> .
and I realized that there was no way that I had a <unk> understood that had had had had , but it was with it , and it was with it , with some scary personal relationship .
There was a conversation that I had to talk about with a doctor and a begrip that I had to tell my <unk> in the Los Angeles of Los Angeles .
And when there was a lot of music , and there was a <unk> , it was a <unk> , <unk> man , which was , of course , from the Los Angeles of Los Angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , at <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of medicine . It &apos;s a real .
For <unk> , it means muziek <unk> .
Because that is what this is , and that is , you know , his mind and <unk> , with some of his <unk> and creativiteit in something <unk> .
and yet , it was more likely to give rise .
I felt that it was that the nature of art is .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing is that , if we go to muziek , what we &apos;re doing in all of us , in all of us , in all of us , in our language , our language , through our artistieke lens , our creativiteit .
and that reality that comes to mind , and it &apos;s going to come up with all of us , and then inspireert us .
So , it was <unk> , it took that muziek into a community of my own parents .
and that <unk> power , and it brought it into a <unk> <unk> , and it was an <unk> <unk> that his talent herkende and it <unk> .
And I &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> , of course , in the Walt Disney <unk> Hall of <unk> Row , want it herinnert me eraan that I became <unk> .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Dankjewel .
Robert Gupta .
Robert Gupta : So I &apos;m going to try to do something that I had <unk> .
I hoop to forgive me .
I &apos;m Jane <unk> . I design games .
I &apos;ve been developing 10 years since 10 years ago , and my aim for the next decennium , is even hard to make the world in reality , who is in <unk> .
I &apos;ve got a plan for it . I &apos;m more likely to talk to you , and I &apos;m going to talk more people , you know , more time playing games and <unk> games .
On this point , three miljard uur per week ,
Some of you might think , &quot; It &apos;s a long time for games . &quot;
Perhaps a lot of time , when we think about who are some of the things that we really want to do in the real world in the real world .
But , in fact , my research study for that , for example , is that , of course , that &apos;s the case in a study of the toekomst , which is quite the opposite .
Three miljard uur per week , at the time , we don &apos;t have half enough ,
In fact , I think that when we have to overleven the other eeuw on this planeet , we really want to have a huge amount of time .
I had berekend that that lasted 21 miljard hours per week ,
I mean , first of all , maybe a little bit of a <unk> , which is , if we can , if we can , if we don &apos;t know how to deal with honger , we &apos;re going to have to address this thing that honger and global conflict <unk> , I think , we moeten design online for a minute or 30 million .
and when you go to the next decennium , you don &apos;t really bother me .
Right ? Well , this picture is very similar .
I think that games are more likely to happen for the survival of the human species in the future .
This is a <unk> fotograaf of fotografen .
There was a lot of people who put in play in play , and they put it into a camera .
This is one of the typical forms of games .
If you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , maybe you don &apos;t , maybe some of them in the diagram .
This is probably a sense of urgentie , which is a little bit bang , but it was <unk> focus , an <unk> <unk> .
Now , when you own it , you &apos;ll see a couple of nuances here , which looks at the top of a <unk> and that is a symbol of optimisme .
This is a speler , which is one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Oh , you know . OK . All right .
So , we &apos;ve got some gamers here .
A <unk> is a result , which is very good , it &apos;s very good , it &apos;s very likely to be ,
It was a bit like a lot of the press , and when you get it , you know .
that &apos;s a really bad prediction . It &apos;s a <unk> prediction .
So , these gamers have been there for a <unk> .
And that &apos;s what we see on a <unk> face of <unk> across the globe , when we take that pad of the week of the week of the week , and the face of the war , that face up in the middle of a <unk> <unk> .
Well , we see a face in real time , when we face a face in real time .
I call it like it was I am &quot; In an <unk> . &quot;
and it &apos;s my face , you can see it ? Yeah . OK .
I mean , who I am &quot; I â€™ m afraid &quot; I am fine . &quot;
This is a graffiti in my native hospital in Berkeley , California , where I onderzocht in my work that we were in games in games .
This is a real issue , which is a huge number .
We think that we don &apos;t even think in the reality that we &apos;re in games .
and I don &apos;t want to do that , but I don &apos;t know ,
We &apos;re going to get into <unk> .
I mean , I put my good at that focus , which is something really <unk> , really geÃ¯nspireerd .
And when we are in a <unk> , I think that many of us are going to take us into our best picture , every time we go to a moment of time , and direct <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we need to take a long time that we take a <unk> .
and in that reality , when we don &apos;t , when we <unk> into the world , we &apos;re going to be very different .
We &apos;re feeling deeply stressed . We feel that we feel , we &apos;re going to be bedreigd . We &apos;re going to be bedreigd , you know , <unk> , pride .
But we don &apos;t , we don &apos;t have a lot of time when we play games , in games .
And that &apos;s what I want to study was a <unk> .
I mean , you know , in games , can we think , is , could not even get it ?
So , who are we able to shift these gevoelens into that reality ?
And then I started to see games that World of Warcraft or Warcraft , which is that that ideal community <unk> .
and I noticed a bunch of things that epic epic <unk> in <unk> .
Ten eerste , when you start to start in one of these <unk> , kind of on World of Warcraft , it &apos;s some of the World of Warcraft , who are ready to give me a <unk> Mission , and that &apos;s right .
But not just a single goal , but a mission , which is perfect to your own level in action , right ?
So , it is .
They don &apos;t have a job that they can &apos;t .
But on top of the <unk> , it &apos;s still going to work .
But he &apos;s not <unk> in World of Warcraft , and you don &apos;t hang around and don &apos;t put it around , and they don &apos;t <unk> .
and he &apos;s <unk> personeel .
where you go to , literally , have <unk> , honderdduizenden people who work with their epic epic .
We don &apos;t really want it in real time , this notion of an <unk> team of werknemers .
And then , again , this epic <unk> , this really boring moment , why we are here , and what we &apos;re doing is , and we &apos;ve got a lot of positieve feedback .
I mean , &quot; level of level , &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; or &quot; + 1 <unk> . &quot;
But this <unk> of feedback is , in real time .
So , if I go close to this podium , I don &apos;t have a talk : plus one of you , plus 20 bizarre ideas .
I don &apos;t end up in the room of this feedback .
So , the problem of <unk> who was that World of Warcraft of Warcraft is , and it &apos;s going to leave every moment at a time at a time when we spend a lot of time in this <unk> <unk> ,
They are more likely to be better .
So , at the moment , all of the World or <unk> <unk> , <unk> miljoen years , we &apos;ve been trying to make these <unk> <unk> ,
It &apos;s not really good .
It may be a bit of a hell .
But in the context of the context , we took a hundred and a half thousand years ago ,
The first <unk> primaat .
OK , when we spend a lot of time , we spend a lot of time , when we spend a lot of time , when we think about that perspective in terms of those terms of the fact of the fact that it &apos;s really interesting .
But it turns out , want it turns out that we &apos;re going to take a lot of time to take a lot of time to play in games , that we veranderen as human beings .
We &apos;re going to create a <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
This is that waarheid . This is what I think .
Let &apos;s remember this interesting statistiek , which recently came from a study of Carnegie Mellon University , which is the typical jonge mens at a time in a country met intense <unk> for 10,000 years .
So , 10,000 uur , it &apos;s really interesting , really interesting :
Ten years ago , for children in the United States , <unk> uur that go through their school school , or at least in school , of the vijfde klas of the High School , I don &apos;t have a <unk> . And we don &apos;t have a complete <unk> .
<unk> , in the young people , at the same time , it was a good speler , who is a child , who is a good speler , who was their school .
and maybe some of you might have a new boek of Malcolm Gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
It &apos;s been <unk> for the great research that when we go to a <unk> study that we &apos;re going to study 10,000 uur when we &apos;re going to spend a lot of <unk> at the 21 years of time , we &apos;re going to <unk> .
And we were very good at doing that very well , who are the leading human beings .
So , what we &apos;ve done here is a single generatie of young people who are <unk> .
The big question is , &quot; Well , that &apos;s where , &quot; is , &quot; How did gamers have <unk> ? &quot;
Because if we could figure out , we had never before that , we &apos;ve never seen that <unk> <unk> .
So , many people are now in the world now , which are at least one uur per dag <unk> .
This is our <unk> . 500 miljoen people , which is really good in &quot; one &quot; .
and the next decennium , we &apos;ve got another one of these million gamers that was really good .
I haven &apos;t heard that .
that <unk> <unk> , which is , <unk> , that &apos;s going to save energy and on the <unk> , in their hands , in India , name in India , particularly in India , name in India , in India .
In the next 10 years , I mean , it was one extra million of the next decennium .
So , we &apos;ve got about 1.5 miljard gamers .
And I began to think about it , what it is that we &apos;re making these games .
So here , those four things that I was ,
Okay , let &apos;s say that extreme <unk> .
<unk> is that demand , it &apos;s going to make a horde of a horde , and it comes to the belief that we have a <unk> hoop .
So , gamers are always going to be able to , and that is an <unk> prediction , and it &apos;s still going to be an end .
So , adolescents don &apos;t hang around .
gamers are in their <unk> closer to social networking .
And he &apos;s a lot more interesting that we can tell people that we &apos;re going to have a lot of more people , when we &apos;ve got to play them with them , when they <unk> their own .
Now , the reason for it is that it takes a lot of vertrouwen , and it takes a match .
And we &apos;re going to vertrouwen that a lot of time , when those of us who are going to <unk> those concepts , we have a conversation that we have .
It allows us to create <unk> , which is what they consume , and they &apos;re going to do it , and they &apos;re doing that .
And as a result , we &apos;re going to create more raw social relaties .
It &apos;s great .
So , you know , he &apos;s an argument , and it &apos;s a reason for 22 miles per week , or <unk> 22 .
And that &apos;s when we spelen , we &apos;re happy to end , heart failure , when we don &apos;t .
We know that we &apos;re perfect when human beings , when we get hard , and we &apos;re making a lot of money .
and gamers are always going to work , hard to change their heart .
and that &apos;s epic .
So , gamers , it &apos;s going to be a lot of ontzag into it .
Here &apos;s an <unk> , looking for it in the right Light , and knowing all the Wikipedia , the Great <unk> of the world .
That &apos;s an Earth-like project of the world called 80,000 <unk> , the World of Warcraft .
Five hundred and five million people ,
and they &apos;ve got more and more <unk> on World of Warcraft in the Internet of Warcraft as if over any other subject in every other world in the world .
It &apos;s a epic .
and it was an <unk> bron of all these World of Warcraft .
Okay , so , it &apos;s four <unk> , which is one that they have , gamers , <unk> , <unk> individuen .
It &apos;s people who think that they can do as individuals who can change the world .
and that &apos;s what they think they can do , they can change the virtual world , but not that real .
This is what I &apos;m doing .
Edward <unk> is a <unk> .
So , our job is an <unk> .
People are still going to , and they &apos;re going to put power into <unk> .
and it says , &quot; Well , we have a lot of a difference between a <unk> in virtual werelden and <unk> . &quot;
and it &apos;s a economist .
and it says , I don &apos;t want who I ,
In fact , it says that , you know , it &apos;s a sense of mind , which is , if gamers are able to increase in <unk> ,
and they can turn into a lot of new quality social networking , if in real life , and they get more feedback and in games in real life .
And it says , it &apos;s a complete logical understanding , that gamers are more likely in the virtual world when in real time .
I &apos;m going to end it .
But it doesn &apos;t have any <unk> .
we &apos;ve got a real world in a match .
My <unk> is a gebeurtenis , which was 2,500 years .
So he &apos;s the <unk> kubus , of course , <unk> . Right ?
So , with this rare <unk> , it was <unk> .
and it was that one of the people who was going to have <unk> , and when you were able to understand the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , I know this verhaal , and that verhaal of how and that verhaal , and why , and how games were invented .
Laut <unk> were games , in the koninkrijk <unk> , in the koninkrijk <unk> , in an hongersnood .
In fact , he was a bad hongersnood , and it was a great hongersnood , and that was a <unk> thought .
and that &apos;s where people had broken .
It was an extreme event . Man had a extreme oplossing .
And then they figured out , it was <unk> , which is that <unk> and <unk> a national strategie , a national strategy , that was going to be next .
and they were going to be very similar to that kind of <unk> , that games are really interesting , and it was an <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that they were not going to be able to eten .
and then , the second man was going to spelen , and the next time you go .
and most of the time they were 18 years of time , they took them 18 years of time , and they were in a second ,
And that &apos;s , I think , now we &apos;re going to play games .
We &apos;re going to go into a view of how we don &apos;t have a real world , and we &apos;re going to create a lot of things in real time , in the real world , in real time , in real time , in real time , in real time , in real life , and we &apos;ve got a <unk> in real life .
But it doesn &apos;t mean it .
It &apos;s that <unk> .
Laut 18 years , I was 18 years old that hongersnood was not going to be better .
and you deelden it in two <unk> .
They were playing a <unk> , and they <unk> into an <unk> avonturen .
They <unk> <unk> , and they were going to take a look at a new life , and they were still going to have some people , who was going to have <unk> , and they went into the rest of them , in the area , in the area ,
It &apos;s crazy .
But the nieuwste <unk> show that that <unk> , which was later the <unk> Reich , who was going to have the <unk> Reich , who had their own DNA .
And then a researcher came to a study recently , that <unk> was really true .
and geologists have found a global health crisis , which was only 20 years of time , was able to say that hongersnood was able to figure out .
This is something that can be <unk> .
They might have been their <unk> , and they were going to have <unk> in games of 18 years into games , and they had that <unk> , and they were able to learn that they were going to have a lot of business .
So , we can .
We &apos;ve been playing on 1994 of Warcraft .
In real time , it was the first time in real time .
that was 16 years .
I mean , 18 years of time , of course , of Warcraft , we &apos;ve been playing these 16 years of Warcraft .
I &apos;m suggesting that we &apos;re ready for our <unk> game .
And then , it was that helft of their business , and they went into a new world , and I went back to a new world .
And we might argue that that half a half of a uur per dag , we are going to have to have a <unk> that we &apos;ve done in a real world .
I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; Well , that &apos;s when we are going to go to a <unk> world of real world .
I mean , I had this question in games , and that I had my job in the afgelopen few years of this day .
So we &apos;ve got this <unk> in our kantoor in Palo Alto , and in Palo Alto , who we could .
We don &apos;t have to change that toekomst .
So , what we &apos;re trying to do is that you go to a city .
and we want to think about that best , and then we want to think about it .
So , we set aside epic <unk> , and we make people that are different .
I &apos;m just going to show you three games , which I set out , for example , to proberen to change people , <unk> <unk> in their own future .
This is &quot; world &apos;s world without olie . &quot;
The match is 2007 .
It &apos;s a <unk> , which is when you get a <unk> .
And that <unk> is invented , but we &apos;ve got to say that we &apos;re going to have a lot of <unk> , and I mean , you know , I mean , you know , in real time , I mean , you know , in real time , that &apos;s where you go .
who are <unk> , who are <unk> , of the school of the schools , and they &apos;ve been able to figure out how to do that , and they figure out how to do that . And we &apos;ll ask him for video games , video games .
So we &apos;ve tested that match in 2007 , and we test them in 2007 , and we &apos;ve got them at that same three years .
and I can tell you a <unk> experience .
Nobody &apos;s going to have been going to be different , because it &apos;s good for that milieu , of course , because we should .
But when you go into a <unk> avonturen and they say , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to have the olie . &quot;
This is an intellectual avonturen , right ?
I mean , who was going to overleven . Those of us who were going to overleven . That &apos;s where we have <unk> .
So , we &apos;ve got to think of it for a second <unk> program , which is more likely to focus on .
So we &apos;ve got a game called &quot; <unk> , &quot; for example ,
So , we don &apos;t think that it takes an <unk> , that those people are only 23 years on the planet .
This supercomputer is called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The oproep for gamers , <unk> , we &apos;ve got a little bit of a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
You know , you know , Jerry <unk> , where it is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; They &apos;ve got the astronauten , the wetenschappers , the wetenschappers , and they can take them into the world .
But in our game , in the five of the people , we say , every single one of the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , and it &apos;s our job , for example , for the toekomst for energy , or the future of the social rechtvaardigheid .
So 8,000 gamers have been playing eight weken .
and then 500 really amazing challenges that you can , when you can write &quot; <unk> , &quot;
And that laatste match , we have a <unk> , which is a match in samenwerking with the Wereldbank .
So , if you finish that match , you &apos;ll say , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; I graduated 2010 .
We &apos;re working in Africa in Africa , and bringing them into Africa , <unk> ,
We &apos;ve got a strip . We &apos;ve got a strip of it . We have &quot; level of level &quot; for <unk> , <unk> , discipline , Vision and <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to tell you all about all of this game , and I want to share with you all the <unk> people , around the world , especially in <unk> , who are able to change their own social ondernemingen around that world .
I &apos;m going to end .
I &apos;m going to ask you a question .
What if , like , what happens next ?
We have all these fantastische gamers , we have games , which we can show , but we have that real world &apos;s real world .
Well , I hoop to tell you that , I mean , that gamers are human resources , which we can use to change in real life , and play games for a greater betekenis .
So , we &apos;ve got all of these <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , scary social networking , <unk> , and that verlangen comes to <unk> .
I &apos;m really sure that we &apos;re going to make a lot of games , we are going to have to overleven in a different galaxy .
and I &apos;m going to do that for a second , and I &apos;m going to do that .
Now , when I go into the 10 10 years , I &apos;m sure that we can go to two things : that we can now <unk> all of the <unk> toekomst , and we can play all the games .
Thank you .
Well , I &apos;ve spent a lot of time when I <unk> myself for the TED community , and it may be rare for a <unk> , want , of course , you know , of course , when I think &quot; a illusie that I am , &quot; that is when someone really gets <unk> in a lot of time .
In some words , in a few studies , in a series of studies , an <unk> effect , the <unk> effect , and it &apos;s just because that man kind of thought it was going to happen , it was an <unk> of an <unk> of it , in an <unk> effect of it in the body , which is an <unk> effect in the body that you call the <unk> .
A note is a little bit more <unk> , want someone else gets it .
So , we think of them again , I &apos;m going to tell you a very nice , very nice trick .
and I &apos;m going to show you , who got it . It &apos;s a trick , which is that , that &apos;s a trick , which is that , of course , that &apos;s a trick for the 1950s .
I &apos;ve got to read it from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the 1970s ,
I &apos;m going to make him , and I &apos;m going to uitleggen it .
and I &apos;m going to uitleggen why I &apos;m going to uitleggen it .
And then , you see ,
The messen , you can study , my hand , which you can study .
I want the mes in my position .
I <unk> my mouw .
and for sure , that &apos;s not in my mouw from my mouw , of it , I &apos;m sure my pols is my pols .
I mean , you can see , and on that point , you can see a little bit of the time . I want to see it in a mouw , I can &apos;t jump into my mouw .
and that doel is really .
I &apos;m going to put my hand open , and I can , and , I think , when everything comes close , it comes to the mes of my internal feeling .
It &apos;s actually a lot of <unk> that I can , without the measure .
I don &apos;t want my mouw into my mouw , or , you know , no <unk> , and you can see it .
<unk> !
Now , it &apos;s a trick that I &apos;m very quick to think about , that I &apos;m very interested in <unk> , because it &apos;s very hard to learn how to learn how to learn how to do it .
Well , maybe some of these guys know this trick .
and that &apos;s what happens .
I put the mes in my hand .
I &apos;m going to tell you that I <unk> my pols , and I &apos;m sure that I don &apos;t end up in my mouw .
And the reason I <unk> my pols is that in the context of the illusie .
At the moment , where I &apos;m going to take my hand out of my hand , I &apos;ll tell you a little bit of it , and I see this vinger here , my <unk> , my <unk> , where there was a <unk> , in which it was there in a position , in which it was <unk> .
<unk> trick ?
There &apos;s a guy who put a child who was kind of kind of old .
So , it &apos;s here . It &apos;s right .
and when I <unk> myself , you &apos;ll see that vinger .
And I might argue that this is why it &apos;s a note , why it &apos;s not the way that you see it here , and there are just three vingers , and that &apos;s where the language and that type of informatie , it doesn &apos;t matter , one , two , three , it &apos;s one , two , three , three , but a groep of three , three , but the groep of .
But it doesn &apos;t really happen . And I open my hand .
So , it &apos;s going to pack it , but it doesn &apos;t contain the magnetisme of my body , but it comes through a trick , which is my <unk> , which is now .
and when I <unk> my hand , it &apos;s going to go through this sort of thing that I want to see when I <unk> my hand is hidden away from this shift .
I &apos;ll take that hand . And here &apos;s the mes .
So this trick can give you your vrienden and my body .
So , what does it mean to do that ?
A jaar of a year , I read a study that I had really <unk> .
I &apos;m not a arts , and I was not a arts .
In fact , it was that , if you give a placebo in a sense of a witte pil , in that sense of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a running , white pil , which is a <unk> effect .
But then , when you &apos;ve put that <unk> into that kind of <unk> , it &apos;s in a smaller pil , and the blauw kleuren and a letter of letters and a letter of letters , it &apos;s actually used to act effectively .
and it doesn &apos;t mean any kind of <unk> , it &apos;s just <unk> .
But a white pil is not even an accident .
So , what ? It really was really <unk> .
But it was not everything .
So , if you take a <unk> , that &apos;s that they &apos;re much more sophisticated if they <unk> any one .
So , a physical capsule , which is one of the <unk> capsule , and in the other end , it &apos;s like a white capsule .
It also takes a <unk> .
A pil at the time every time is not even bad than three <unk> -- I can &apos;t remember this exact statistiek .
But that &apos;s ,

and that <unk> is one .
and when you &apos;ve got to see the ultieme <unk> , it &apos;s going to be hit .
Right ? So , it was a spuit with a <unk> -- some of the <unk> of a <unk> wave , which is one of the <unk> that you <unk> .
It turns out that it &apos;s a very big picture in the face . It &apos;s a lot of krachtiger that a white pil .
This graphics is , I &apos;m going to show you a second time when we have a <unk> .
Now , you know , the white pil that don &apos;t even seem to be , but it doesn &apos;t even seem to be that this blauwe pil , who doesn &apos;t even seem like a capsule , who doesn &apos;t even seem to be <unk> who doesn &apos;t even seem to be that the death penalty .
and it doesn &apos;t have any <unk> eigenschap . It &apos;s just our belief that we think about an increase in a greater effect .
I wanted to figure out , I was able to use it for a magic trick .
I &apos;m going to say something that &apos;s obvious , and it really takes a look .
Well , we know , in the course of the study , that guy &apos;s going to be able to hit the top .
This is a 18 centimeter <unk> . It &apos;s very , very <unk> . And I kind of zoom in .
This is my own material . It &apos;s not <unk> <unk> .
This is my limb . It &apos;s a <unk> of Hollywood .
I &apos;m going to put that plastic into my limb in my limb , and through them , and they <unk> them up on the other kant .
Now , I &apos;m going to become a bit of a <unk> -- when you fall down into <unk> -- I had a few vrienden at the hotelkamer hotelkamer , and some of the ones I didn &apos;t know , and it was a woman who I didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s got a <unk> .
And I can tell you that I &apos;m going to become a word going to become a second 30 seconden .
I mean , you can see it , but I can tell you , you know ,
And then , it &apos;s going to , of course , where my vlees starts , in the onderste gedeelte of my arm , I kind of run a little <unk> .
Does it really lead me . Is it crazy ?
and now a little bit of my skin , and that &apos;s a little bit of my skin .
And now , we &apos;re in the exact same event that we had when we had <unk> .
It &apos;s about .
But now , you can &apos;t possibly meet my vinger , right ?
I &apos;m going to show you . It &apos;s one , two , three , four , five .
Yeah .
I know what those people think when they see it .
and they say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s not the trick , and it &apos;s not even dom and <unk> that huid , just for a few minutes . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you .
Who here does this ? Well , it &apos;s good .
Yeah , I &apos;m sure , and those guys said , &quot; Okay , I don &apos;t have this kind of . &quot;
Those of the people who go into the <unk> are now .
I &apos;m going to show you that .
It &apos;s really my limb . It &apos;s not a <unk> of Hollywood .
This is my vlees , and I can do it .
Sorry . And when you &apos;re mad , you see , I don &apos;t look .
And those guys at the back of that , of course , that people later see a second at the video , and they say , &quot; Oh yes , it looks really really really glad , but if it really was , there &apos;s a little bit of it , and when it really was , it &apos;s going to be <unk> . &quot;
OK , I &apos;m a bit of an <unk> for you .
Yes , this is .
So , typically , I took that death .
I was my arm <unk> , and you see , he was not an <unk> .
But I think in the context of that frame , and I think that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do in a little bit of <unk> , and it &apos;s going to go into it .
We became a couple of these <unk> .
I &apos;m going to try to do that . Thanks very much .
I mean , I was in my country ,
I was just two .
This eerste , that was more like a gepassioneerde <unk> .
It was a mooie vis , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> on the <unk> .
It was for a vis .
And yet , again , it was more likely to come into school , and that &apos;s actually going to take out of the decline of <unk> ,
I mean , you might think of it .
I had a relationship that I had about several times .
And a second , I was a man named Chef , and he said , &quot; Well , I had to go to a second assignment for a second that I had to do next . &quot;
&quot; Natuurlijk , &quot; I said .
So , here was a business school that was going to work was going to have been taken out of the <unk> <unk> , right ?
In the last 50 years , we have <unk> that we had <unk> who have <unk> .
It &apos;s really hard , and it &apos;s <unk> .
90 percent of the great <unk> , that we &apos;re going to love that tonijn , which is <unk> , which is <unk> , <unk> , they are ingestort .
It &apos;s not a bit more over .
And I might argue , of course , <unk> , <unk> , which is a part of our toekomst .
Now , some of these <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which means that , most of them , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> .
There is a <unk> , 15 .
It &apos;s 15 pond <unk> , and it &apos;s going to take a pond <unk> .
Not very much .
Not very good .
And here was a student , who probeerde , who probeerde it .
I was to <unk> .
The second time , I named the director of the <unk> , I called the director .
Now , we don &apos;t need it .
&quot; Don &apos;t , &quot; I said , &quot; Well , just for that data , it &apos;s going to have the fact that they &apos;re going to have <unk> in the ocean , and they don &apos;t suck . &quot;
&quot; This is where , &quot; he said . &quot; Well , we &apos;re very close to it , &quot; We are very close to our <unk> . &quot;
and then , in a sense , in a sense , &quot; We are in a real world .
This <unk> at 2.5 percent : &quot; He said .
&quot; That &apos;s the best one in that business . &quot;
2.5 , great .
&quot; One was one was ? What does they carry ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> eiwit , &quot; he said .
&quot; Wow , &quot; I said . <unk> .
And that was when I was standing in bed , and I was thinking , &quot; What is a hell of a <unk> ? &quot;
I was going to call the second day , even before the subject , Don &apos;t .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t , I mean , maybe that &apos;s why , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example ,
There was no sign . There was no sign .
I <unk> with a couple of people in the business school , and I didn &apos;t want to ask him a single question .
Now , we don &apos;t need it .
&quot; Don &apos;t , &quot; I said , &quot; Well , I mean , you know , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , that
There was a bunch of algen and some <unk> , and then they said , <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
There said , &quot; Yeah , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; How about a percent <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
or two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t really , was a <unk> , kip ? &quot;
He was a long pauze in that line , and he said , &quot; He &apos;s really too much the kip in the world . &quot;
I <unk> myself from this vis .
Oh , not , want I was a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This is my own .
Oh , I got <unk> , or I <unk> , I zweer in God , I zweer in God , that entertainment comes into this entertainment .
This tweede vis , it &apos;s a different type of <unk> .
And it &apos;s that romantic Art , who , the guy , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ll remember that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ll remember that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
I took him out in a restaurant in <unk> .
A <unk> journalist had a long time for this fish .
and it was an <unk> .
There was a very hard time with a <unk> white white kleur .
His chef had it .
Stop .
<unk> was a <unk> .
So , how does it take a long time , if you can afford it ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy .
Now , we need to call it Miguel . There &apos;s Miguel .
and it didn &apos;t buy it , and it &apos;s not a Koch , and it &apos;s not a chef-kok , or that , and I &apos;m going to describe it .
There &apos;s a bioloog at <unk> La <unk> .
This is a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s when you stay in the middle of the line ,
In that 1980s , that was in the hands of <unk> ,
They <unk> <unk> , in fact , was <unk> .
and they made it through that land .
They &apos;re going to take a <unk> set of <unk> , and they <unk> water from the land , and in the rivier .
They didn &apos;t make it , they didn &apos;t believe that it was going to , it was going to have a <unk> .
and it was an ramp .
It was about 90 percent of the natural world for this site ,
And it was an electric company called <unk> called the land .
What did they do ?
and they have the flow of water .
They have a lot of the <unk> .
In terms of the water <unk> , they used the water <unk> ,
They <unk> those kanalen .
and we created a 11,000 country called <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and there are Miguel and that <unk> , and there are some of those things called ecologische vernietiging .
And that boerderij is really amazing .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen it before .
and they see a little bit of the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything was they see there are <unk> kanalen and this dense <unk> .
I was a long time for Miguel .
There &apos;s a ongelofelijke man , three and Charles Darwin Charles Darwin and a piece &quot; A krokodil of the <unk> . &quot;
Right ? So , we were , and vochten for that <unk> , and I <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , I had <unk> to my knieÃ«n , and Miguel in a <unk> .
So , here you have a zeldzame <unk> .
Now , there was that <unk> of fytoplankton .
And here , there &apos;s a patroon of <unk> , where there &apos;s a piece of <unk> giraffe .
Well , it turns out , Miguel , which is , Miguel , <unk> National Park in Africa was in Africa .
I told him , who became a <unk> .
and said , &quot; vis ? I don &apos;t know about the vis .
I &apos;m an expert for relaties . &quot;
And then , it goes , and it &apos;s going to be in more gepraat , and it goes into more gepraat of zeldzame vogels and algen and <unk> .
and I don &apos;t believe that it was really interesting , that was really interesting , I mean , that <unk> gemeenschap <unk> , in the sense of it .
It &apos;s great , but I was .
and my head is <unk> about this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I had .
I didn &apos;t store it . I said , &quot; Miguel , you know , Miguel , who is the exact vis ? &quot;
There was shown on those algen .
&quot; I know , I know , Jongen , the algen , the fytoplankton , that &apos;s really amazing .
But I mean , I mean , war , how ?
Who is that <unk> ? &quot;
Now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s going to give me a <unk> system , which is that they were going to eten that they were in the wild ,
And that <unk> biomassa , the fytoplankton , the water <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> ,
This is a kind of <unk> , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
He &apos;s not a plant .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s not going to <unk> their own .
Later I woke up on this site , and I went to this site , and I told him , I said , &quot; Well , he was going to be <unk> , &quot; I said , &quot; In an area , that &apos;s going to be the case , &quot; of course , &quot; that meet you ? &quot;
At the moment , it was like a <unk> <unk> ,
And we and the bows and our bone and our body was a little bit more silent , and it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is an <unk> <unk> .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s a succes . &quot; He said .
&quot; Look at her <unk> , roze .
<unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? I was really shocked .
I said , &quot; Miguel , you don &apos;t want to kill her ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah , &quot; she said .
&quot; We &apos;re going to lose 20 percent of our vis and <unk> that vogels .
So , at this site , 600.000 vogels , like 250 different types of different types .
It &apos;s now the largest private private private private school in Europe today .
I said , &quot; Miguel , you know , is a good piece of a <unk> <unk> , right ? &quot;
There are <unk> , or no .
There said , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to build <unk> , not a lot .
This is a <unk> netwerk .
That <unk> , those <unk> .
and those garnalen , they put the fytoplankton .
So , you can see the man that &apos;s more broken . &quot;
Okay , so , again , I think that &apos;s going to work . A Farm , which is that they don &apos;t have their <unk> , and they &apos;re going to have a Farm , which is that they meet their success in their diet .
It was an <unk> , but it was a <unk> .
Oh , and , and I don &apos;t want to be able to <unk> this <unk> of <unk> .
In a city in a city , it was 240 miles away , where that <unk> is more likely for the <unk> .
Every morning , it vliegt 240 miles into the boerderij .
and every morning , it takes 240 miles .
They want it , because they can end up the <unk> witte line of <unk> .
Serieus .
I had a trip to an <unk> event that I &apos;ve been imagining Miguel .
I said , &quot; Miguel , you &apos;re going to go 240 miles into the boerderij and take 240 miles back ? &quot;
Do they do it for those kids ? &quot;
There was a <unk> when I was a lied of Whitney .
There said , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s going to make it , want it &apos;s going to be better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t say that limb was my lover , which was heerlijk was , and I can &apos;t <unk> it . I can &apos;t <unk> it .
It &apos;s that <unk> , <unk> .
I <unk> it .
and yet , if I took them in a restaurant in a restaurant , she doesn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> .
<unk> and in a row , if you were going to take a return of the oceaan .
I had to say it was Miguel and it <unk> .
and said , &quot; This is an <unk> .
This is that laatste <unk> , before in the body ,
and they &apos;ve done that in the evolutie of the evolutie ,
and then , we said , &quot; But our water doesn &apos;t go . &quot;
OK . In fact , a Farm , which is their own land , that they don &apos;t have a Farm , and that &apos;s where they reach their .
And I realized when hij says , there &apos;s a Farm , which doesn &apos;t have <unk> , <unk> , that water stroomt from the <unk> of the rivier in the stream .
It &apos;s a rivier where all these things are going to , of course , that they tend to create the rivieren of rivieren now , or they &apos;re going to have <unk> .
and when it was a <unk> , and this is a smile of it , which is a <unk> water , when it &apos;s <unk> .
This is a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> water .
not just a single Farm , which doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , not a single Farm , who meet their success , but a Farm , which is a <unk> , which is an <unk> , and it &apos;s not just for the ones that were , but for them and me .
Because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the Atlantische Oceaan .
A druppel in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;m going to say it , and I &apos;m going to do it , you know , that <unk> , who are romantic , who are romantic .
Man might say , &quot; Well , it &apos;s a <unk> for that future , for example , of course , &quot; <unk> , of <unk> .
So , what we &apos;ve got to do today is a radicaal nieuw concept of landbouw , or one of them , in the code , in the food chain .
But for a lot of people , it is slightly slightly .
We don &apos;t have a <unk> , we <unk> . We &apos;re minnaar .
We &apos;re going to <unk> . We don &apos;t know small <unk> . So we &apos;re talking about regional production . We &apos;re going to <unk> .
and when you claim , that those things are going to be a second , who are going to give a good feed for a second , and he says , &quot; Hey , people , I &apos;m going to love <unk> <unk> , but who became the world ?
Who became the world ? &quot;
I want to be more honest ?
I won &apos;t .
Oh , not , want we &apos;re making enough calorieÃ«n in order for that world more than just to feed .
A miljard of people have <unk> .
A miljard -- that &apos;s more if you &apos;ve ever been talking about -- <unk> ongelijkheid in the world , not the <unk> .
Now , I can &apos;t answer this question , want it was that metaphor of our <unk> that we have about 50 years .
<unk> was a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , kip , and that whole time , &quot; If we were more willing to give them that <unk> , &quot; that if we were more likely to be more free , it &apos;s going to be something that would be bad ?
It was that it was . It was that <unk> . It was the <unk> of American Landbouw .
We &apos;d call them , which is , it was , a <unk> in <unk> , an <unk> , which is <unk> , which is very likely to <unk> the productie .
It &apos;s not a <unk> , and it &apos;s not <unk> .
Our <unk> is going to be bedreigd today , not <unk> <unk> , but door <unk> middelen ,
that &apos;s not the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , but through <unk> land , not door water , but door <unk> water , not door <unk> and <unk> , in the middle of the zee .
I mean , they want to feed that world ?
So , how would we start to start a question : What are we going to do ?
Of course , who can , where can we , where can we , where can all of our own community , who can create their own community ?
To do that , you don &apos;t see it for that <unk> .
It &apos;s really , and it &apos;s done .
So , that was , you know , scheikunde and human equipment , and they &apos;ve got it <unk> , and it hasn &apos;t made a really good job .
In a way , we want to see that ecological model .
It &apos;s two miljard years of <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to see Miguel , boeren who are Miguel .
Governments , which are not the <unk> of the <unk> , that they pick up the <unk> , governments , who are <unk> in their <unk> , and they don &apos;t really believe that they are in the country , and experts who are not just <unk> , but experts , experts for relaties .
They are the ones who are experts .
and when I &apos;m really honest , it &apos;s a kind of a living chef-kok when I &apos;m going to .
Now , I mean , you know , it &apos;s me , want when it &apos;s going to take a look for a fine voedsel , it &apos;s going to be verrukkelijk .
Thank you .
I grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
I went to my school bus , I went to my school bus , every single day .
and my husband had been <unk> in a book , an <unk> , which is my mind in other werelden , and in my view , in my face <unk> , <unk> nieuwsgierigheid .
Now this honesty was also that I was when I was when I was when I was when I was when I was when I was in school , I went through those bossen , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , everything went on .
I was really <unk> , you know .
And it was going to go to the time , and it was going to be able to understand the world and those <unk> <unk> .
and my great science fiction was that I was in my country , in the late &apos; 60s , when , in the late &apos; 60s , we were going to see at the maan and <unk> those .
Jacques Cousteau came in our woonkamer with his <unk> shows , which was an <unk> , and in a world , and there was a world that we &apos;ve never imagined before .
I mean , it was pretty good at the <unk> <unk> .
and I was a kunstenaar .
I could read . I could .
So , it was not a <unk> nor <unk> films that I had <unk> in the <unk> films , and I was able to create these pictures in my face .
I mean , we wanted to go back to a book , and when we had a book , we took that beschrijving of the <unk> and we <unk> them onto that canvas in our faces .
And my reactie was that I had tekenen , and it was signs of aliens , and I had robots , <unk> , robots .
In the process , I got a lot of time when I was in a row of the leerkracht , who I had , was <unk> .
and that creativiteit was going to go .
and it was interesting . Was that was interesting , was that I was that Jacques <unk> shows , was an <unk> world in a view of a <unk> world on our planet .
I would have a picture of a contemporary world in a ruimteschip , and it leek me really onwaarschijnlijk .
But there was a world that I could see here on the Earth , and it was even unusual and exotic and exotic who had been <unk> me when I had this time .
I decided when I was 15 , I went back to a potato .
And the only thing was that I lived in a small dorpje in Canada , 3,000 miles of the dichtstbijzijnde Earth .
So , I didn &apos;t want to <unk> it .
I <unk> my vader , until finally a <unk> at Buffalo , New York , have found that in the other side of the grens , where we lived .
I was my <unk> in a zwembad of the <unk> in the winter at Buffalo , New York .
The ocean , I had a real world , two years later , when we came back to California .
And now , in 40 years , that &apos;s now <unk> , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 uur water in <unk> . 500 uur in <unk> .
and I learned that in the world in the deep world , in the <unk> oceanen , it &apos;s rijk that we can &apos;t even imagine .
So , that &apos;s not an <unk> view of the world that we don &apos;t , but in contrast to our own , <unk> .
But at the time , I &apos;m probably feeling absolutely <unk> ontzag that I see on my <unk> .
and my love for the oceaan , my love who was still , and you .
And when I was when a lot of time was a job , it was <unk> .
I mean , it was that best possibility , my innerlijke <unk> , and my ability to connect to my narrative , and take a <unk> .
As kind of as I kind of made a kind of <unk> and it was .
And then , films , and that was a <unk> , and it was <unk> .
I mean , those verhalen that I had <unk> , which I call myself <unk> : &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; Aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
In &quot; <unk> , &quot; I had my voorliefde for those <unk> , and it was going to connect with the cinema .
and then <unk> my both <unk> .
He was interesting for &quot; <unk> . &quot; So , if you had a <unk> project , and that &apos;s what we had to call a <unk> problem in the film -- and that &apos;s what we were able to call an <unk> <unk> -- we had a set of <unk> in a traditional form of it .
What was that was that the first <unk> <unk> was that you saw in a film .
Now , the film didn &apos;t have any money , and that was a little bit of a <unk> , and I noticed that it was an <unk> , but I noticed that this publiek was in the world in the world who was <unk> .
Laut Arthur Clarke , of course , is <unk> technology , and it doesn &apos;t seem to be different from each other .
and then you saw a little bit more <unk> .
And I was very excited .
and I thought , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s going to go into that <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And then we went into &quot; Terminator Two , &quot; my next film , I fell .
So , both of these things , we took that type of <unk> , we put it into the man of vloeibaar metaal , and it was going to depend on that effect .
And it worked . Again , we had something called <unk> , and that effect was in an audience , we &apos;ve already got a little bit more <unk> .
From both of these two ervaringen , was a really new world , a whole new world of creativiteit for <unk> .
I built a bedrijf called my <unk> <unk> Winston , which was when I was in the best teaching <unk> and <unk> . &quot; Digital <unk> . &quot;
And that basisidee of this study was , that was <unk> processen , etc . , etc . , etc . , you know , <unk> procedures , etc . , etc .
and we did that , and we took a while , and we took an <unk> .
But in the middle of the 1990s , we noticed that we had a lot of <unk> and <unk> -- where we &apos;re going to go into that business -- too .
I had this piece &quot; Avatar , &quot; which is that <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and <unk> effecten in <unk> , and <unk> effects , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is all the <unk> .
But that <unk> gave me a little bit more beautiful , and those guys in my bedrijf vertelden me that we would not be able to <unk> it .
And then I <unk> it , and I had this other film about the big boot , you know .
I had a <unk> that I was like &quot; Romeo and Juliet on a schip . &quot; It was a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
I mean , if I was there , it was a real complete collapse in the Titanic .
So , I took the film .
This is that kind of waarheid . The studio had never .
I was just trying to say , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to take a <unk> . We &apos;ll film the real collapse .
We &apos;ve got it in the <unk> of the film .
It &apos;s really important . It &apos;s a good job of marketing . &quot;
I <unk> them , a foundation .
<unk> . But it &apos;s going to be a little bit of a reality that makes that reality .
So we took six maanden later a reality that I was in a row , in which I put me into a Russische <unk> <unk> , four miles of the <unk> , and my real Titanic was a real Titanic .
It was a film , not a TV , it was really .
And it was really <unk> .
And that was that gap was huge . We had camera and <unk> and everything else .
and I noticed that this <unk> , an <unk> <unk> .
They were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
In this capsule , you &apos;ll see in the capsule , and you see in the same donkere , <unk> <unk> , where no hoop was going to be <unk> .
and I thought , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s even when I was in a <unk> .
It &apos;s really cool . &quot;
I was really excited by the way that I was behind .
And when it comes to that kind of thing that comes to nieuwsgierigheid and science , it was all . It was a avontuur , it was honesty . It was real .
and it was a ervaring that I couldn &apos;t make Hollywood .
Because , I mean , I could imagine an <unk> that we could take a visual effect , but I couldn &apos;t imagine that I was outside of the <unk> .
In a few of the countries I have seen in <unk> , and sometimes some things that I haven &apos;t seen before , maybe some things that I had never seen before , including the fact that none of this was before , and for that science , when we saw them , I didn &apos;t even have a thought .
I had a very nice <unk> , and I was more .
and then I went to a physical beslissing .
After that , I said , &quot; Okay , I &apos;m going to go to my head when filmmakers put into Hollywood in Hollywood , and I put it into a little bit of <unk> . &quot;
And then , we &apos;ve begun to plan these expedities .
And we came up with a <unk> , and they <unk> them with <unk> .
we went back to the Titanic .
We used small robots that we had built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
Our bedoeling was to see , <unk> and then see the inside of the <unk> , has been never done before .
and no one had your <unk> <unk> . Man had no treatment for it . And we didn &apos;t have any tool .
So , after all , I &apos;m on the dek of the Titanic , in an <unk> , and I &apos;m standing there , you know , that <unk> here , that <unk> here , that <unk> here , and I &apos;m sure that the band was in .
and I vlieg a little <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
I mean , it was just , but my mind is , but my geest is within the <unk> .
And it was an <unk> , if I was an individual in the size of the Titanic .
This was that <unk> kind of <unk> that I had you heard , want before I took a row of <unk> , I had been able to figure out what was going on in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , I was going to go to the film .
So , that set was a very nice kopie of the <unk> of <unk> .
It was a very rare experience .
And so I realized that <unk> <unk> , that we use the <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> in the voertuig of the voertuig in the voertuig , in the other area that you can see .
It was really deeply <unk> .
and maybe a little bit of a little wonder , maybe maybe in a few decennia , when you &apos;ve got <unk> , for example , in all sorts of things , in all sorts of things , in all sorts of <unk> <unk> , which I can imagine when you can imagine <unk> .
So , after all die expedities , we &apos;ve been able to see that we &apos;ve been able to see that <unk> , this <unk> , where we &apos;ve seen these really <unk> dieren , and it &apos;s an alien , but here on Earth .
They live with <unk> .
They don &apos;t exist in a focus on a focus on us , who we do it .
and that &apos;s where you see ,
<unk> , and you can &apos;t imagine that they can overleven .
Even though I was very interested in <unk> , it was that I was in my childhood , it was that I was in my childhood .
And I ended up with that kind of people who are interested in the city , and they &apos;ve done that NASA and in the <unk> , and they go into <unk> , and they go back to Rusland , and they &apos;re going to go back to Rusland , and they <unk> up the <unk> <unk> , and take up our <unk> .
It was an amazing thing .
But when I was going to go into it , it was going to <unk> me in those diepzee .
I took them out and they <unk> them into the world called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , mensen , who were interested in the extreme situaties , and I took them into the security of them , and they were going to take them into the security process , and they were able to test them .
We took a lot of <unk> , but in fact , in fact , in fact , it was a real thing for us to say , <unk> .
And then I went through the cirkel of my bestaan as a child , as a kind of time , and that change in that reality .
In many cases , I had a lot of learning .
I &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but I had a lot to learn about <unk> .
Now , you know , you know , you know , an regisseur , it may be able to have a principal who can become a <unk> .
but I don &apos;t think about it . I don &apos;t think about it .
Because at a time , I had to say , &quot; What do I do here ?
How do I do it ? What is it going ? &quot;
These <unk> movies don &apos;t give us any money .
We &apos;re looking at that <unk> . They don &apos;t know .
I mean , you know , I was between &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar , &quot; and I had that <unk> in a handdoek on a foot on the strand .
I had all these films , this <unk> , for a very small publiek .
Not roem , no privilege , no , no , what do you do ?
So , I &apos;m going to do it for a job , and that &apos;s going to want to want to go for a challenge -- and the ocean is that , you know , it is . It &apos;s going to be the <unk> community that he <unk> , and for the rare <unk> , that &apos;s when a small groep of a team of a human .
So , we took all this 10 to 10 , 12 of 12 people who have been doing them , and they were able to have two of three maanden to drop .
And in this community , you recognize that that &apos;s really important that it &apos;s a bit of a <unk> that you face , want it was a real deal that you &apos;ve been given to , which is that they don &apos;t want to be able to figure that .
And when you go into a country and say , &quot; Well , we had to do it , that <unk> , that <unk> , and it really <unk> , and that &apos;s all the <unk> , and that &apos;s when it comes to the other hand , and that &apos;s when it comes to the other hand , it doesn &apos;t want to be able to figure out . It &apos;s that they don &apos;t want to be able to figure out . It &apos;s that they don &apos;t want to be a <unk> . It &apos;s that
That &apos;s a link , an <unk> respect .
So , if I was back to my next film , I took my &quot; Avatar &quot; , and I probeerde to figure out how to give me a <unk> team , that man will give his team respect .
and that dynamiek really was different .
I was a little bit of a little team on <unk> terrein . We took &quot; Avatar &quot; with a new technology that we had before .
<unk> .
It &apos;s a huge uitdaging .
and we were at a time for a moment or a half years .
and that &apos;s what I think was different ,
and he had some people who said , we had this <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> in the <unk> of the Earth .
But for me , it was a <unk> manier , my job , my job , who was going to change in the outcome .
So , what can we get out of it ?
What was a lesson we learned ?
I think a lot of it is that nieuwsgierigheid .
It &apos;s the most dynamic human .
Our verbeelding is an ability to create a reality .
and that signal is more than any kind of team of team of the world .
For me , jonge filmmakers , who say , &quot; Give me an advies , who can tell me a question . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Don &apos;t blame your own .
This is another thing for you . Don &apos;t mean it doesn &apos;t mean to jezelf , you don &apos;t end up in your voice . &quot;
NASA was an <unk> : &quot; Well , not a alternatief . &quot;
But in the art of the world , we need to have a bit of a alternatief for a alternatief , want it &apos;s a <unk> .
Not a really big business , that innovatie was a set of innovation ,
Man &apos;s going to need to go to that matter .
I mean , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to leave you with . I mean , I want to talk about that . I mean , mislukking is a real thing , fear is a real difference .
Now , I &apos;m going to talk about one of these things , which is that those data that we consumeren , that we &apos;re going to take a lot of the data that we &apos;re going to consume , and in plaats van to think about <unk> , I think that we think about how we can use data that we can use the data that we &apos;re using , and we see the trend that we can see that we &apos;re not going to be able to see the DNA that we can see .
So , what we see here is a typical <unk> view of time .
This programma , which I mean , is a small experiment .
It &apos;s called <unk> , which I can do with <unk> , is that I can take a second of a number of factors that I can take out of the number of matter .
And direct , I see a different set of patronen .
And that &apos;s because in the <unk> , that people are standing here at the <unk> , and they &apos;re here on the <unk> .
We can take a step back and put together that data and see the data and see that <unk> and depression that are going to be similar ,
Now , when we go back and forth , maybe 40 jaar , we say , maybe 40 years of jonger , we say , ongelukken , and that crashes have a lot of people ,
and when <unk> , it &apos;s very similar to people ,
And you recognize that that <unk> , and it turns out that there was a <unk> in a living rooms in a living rooms .
and if we can make that of ruwe data , why don &apos;t we even ?
So , what we &apos;ve done here is that <unk> every single one of them &quot; Sports <unk> , &quot; which is one that they had .
It &apos;s all this . It &apos;s all online .
I &apos;m going to test it to my next talk in the box .
They can live in a decennium of a decennium .
They can live in one of them .
I can jump into a single edition .
Now , when I &apos;m here , I see that , I see those <unk> , that sporten .
I was a <unk> fan fan , and I <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and I set out all the time that I &apos;m going to show you in <unk> Armstrong .
Now , if I want to go for a <unk> review , I &apos;d like to think &quot; OK , what if I &apos;m my mind looking at the <unk> ? &quot;
And then I go back to a little bit of a <unk> .
I see Greg <unk> .
and it &apos;s going to be a sense of it , that when we go to that type of informatie , you <unk> , <unk> , breder , <unk> , that don &apos;t work .
This is something that &apos;s slightly different .
And it &apos;s a bit of an area , and we think it &apos;s going to change that Art and Weise who can be used .
So I &apos;m going to take a bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of crazy .
So , what we &apos;ve done here is , we took each one of these <unk> , and they put them on a little samenvatting .
And that samenvatting is a little bit of a <unk> and a symbool for the area of it .
I &apos;m just going to show those top 500 of these <unk> <unk> .
But in fact , in that <unk> , we can make a lot of things .
Well , we need a picture of these things that are on that sort of <unk> that Wikipedia ,
I &apos;m now going to do it now .
So , after I have &quot; regering , &quot; I mean that those <unk> <unk> , which are the <unk> <unk> , &quot; human &apos; <unk> . &quot;
This is really important , want this is a thing that doesn &apos;t exist in one piece of <unk> .
That &apos;s just when we go to a piece of time , and that &apos;s when you look into a piece of a piece .
In some sense , I can go into a view of Time magazine : &quot; People of the Year of <unk> , &quot; and they go into it .
Now , if I &apos;m going to see all of these individual subjects , I &apos;m sure that that merendeel of it is <unk> . Some of them komen out of the science . Some of them , or I &apos;m going to , you know , my boss .
And , interestingly , Bono was a TED Prize ,
And then , we can jump into all the TED Prize for all TED Prize ,
Man , we &apos;ll see , we <unk> the web in the Web , and it &apos;s a net web , not just from bladzijde , or a lot of time .
And I &apos;d like to show you a little bit of a little verrassing .
I &apos;m just showing that New York Times website .
<unk> , this is -- I &apos;m not going to have a browser , it &apos;s a browser , it &apos;s really a browser , but you can see websites that we can see here -- and we can do that <unk> at all .
And I can go back to a moment , and put it into a row , and put it into a normal <unk> .
And so that &apos;s important , because we want to see that view of the site of websites in the exact opposite direction ,
and I can zoom in into a single period of time .
Here &apos;s the stand of this sort of <unk> that I had ,
and I can tell all wat I &apos;ve been studying today , again .
And when I go back again and see , I &apos;m going to take a little <unk> , and I can take my <unk> back into my <unk> . Here I went to &quot; <unk> , &quot; here , I went here to live here at <unk> , of Live Labs .
And of course , I &apos;m going to go into that site , and it comes back to me .
And it &apos;s a metaphor that we used to take a long time , and every time it comes to that picture , and every time it looks very similar to that kind of <unk> .
Right now , in the world , we think that data is a vloek .
We have a lot of <unk> .
We drove from a &quot; <unk> . &quot;
So , what if we were going to see this place and the Internet set up to the Internet , we don &apos;t want to go to a different way of going to go into the others , we begin to figure out whether or not going to be able to do some things that would be hidden in the way that they had <unk> .
So , if we can do that , that &apos;s going to be <unk> , maybe a new bron of <unk> .
and , in the course of the data , we can figure out how to move .
and when we learn to understand , maybe we can actually pull out of it .
I &apos;m very lucky .
I mean , every time you talk about happiness .
I have some of these guys who have <unk> , who have been <unk> in a book , who published in the afgelopen vijf jaar , and they were about 40 , and they were probably left .
It &apos;s a huge golf of interest of interest rates of happiness .
He &apos;s very hard .
Iedereen would like to make these guys happy .
But , ondanks all of this <unk> , they have several <unk> <unk> , which is that they would take a little bit of a lot of the time .
And my Talk here today is that I &apos;m going to talk about these <unk> .
And it &apos;s kind of <unk> , who think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s kind of for wetenschappers who think about happiness , and that we don &apos;t think that we are only feeling that one .
The first one of them is <unk> ,
Well , it turns out that happiness doesn &apos;t even make a neutral term , because we &apos;re at the very opposite .
I think it &apos;s a defining thing that we would like , but in the Great of these things , it &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to need to be more likely , and we &apos;re going to be able to think of it , and we zullen create that ingewikkelde view of life .
And that tweede legal thing is a <unk> of expertise or <unk> , which is , basically , it &apos;s one of the people who live in his lifestyle and to end their lives .
and it &apos;s two different things , and they &apos;re both <unk> and they &apos;re both <unk> .
And that derde is that it <unk> , and it &apos;s that really valuable feit that we think that we can &apos;t think about a decision , meaning that we don &apos;t think about its way .
I mean , it &apos;s a real called <unk> .
And he doesn &apos;t have a way , it &apos;s really going to be able to .
I &apos;m going to talk about someone who was a <unk> had , who had a <unk> had , was a <unk> . There was a <unk> <unk> , and it was completely <unk> , and it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and then , in a sense , it &apos;s very helpful , it &apos;s going to <unk> that whole <unk> .
But it didn &apos;t .
In fact , what it was that was <unk> was that experience .
There was that <unk> .
There was 20 minuten <unk> .
They didn &apos;t want , want there was a man who was expected , that was lost was <unk> , and that was a herinnering , was it was going to have <unk> .
Now , what it really says is that we think about ourselves and think about other people in mind , or two types of self .
And it &apos;s a <unk> self , which is that in the present moment , in the present moment , in the present moment , in the present moment , in the verleden , and in fact , in fact , in fact , it &apos;s in a moment .
And it &apos;s the <unk> self , which is the arts <unk> -- you know , when the arts asked him , &quot; Well , it &apos;s going to be bad when I <unk> here ? &quot;
And then he &apos;s a <unk> self , and that &apos;s a <unk> self , and that <unk> is , and that verhaal of our everyday lives , and it &apos;s going to take a lot of time in our homes , and it comes to that question , &quot; How did I feel at a moment ? &quot;
&quot; Who was your journey ? &quot; of it .
This is two different types of <unk> , the <unk> self , and that <unk> and those both of them defines the <unk> of death .
So , the <unk> self is a verhalenverteller .
and it really begins with a fundamentele reactie on our geheugen -- it starts to start .
We don &apos;t want to tell them a lot of time , when we think about the story .
Our minds vertelden us to a story , which is what we call our <unk> .
and I &apos;m going to show you a way .
He was a <unk> .
This is real patient , which is an <unk> procedure .
I &apos;m not going to go into the Detail . This is not more pijnlijk , but she was pijnlijk , like this study in the 1990s .
and they told them all 60 seconden about their wives .
And here are two of us . It &apos;s their records .
and they said , &quot; How did this both have to have more <unk> ? &quot;
and it &apos;s a very simple question .
and that patient B was more likely to have a <unk> , and his <unk> was a lot of time , and every minuut of their periods of time , that patient had a patient B , and more .
But now , he &apos;s a different question , &quot; How are we really thinking that they had this patient ? &quot;
This is a random .
and that is , that patient is a much more likely to have a <unk> <unk> that had been used to <unk> .
and that <unk> were different , and that &apos;s different , and that &apos;s because of a very peculiar way of doing that .
And not one of these things , but one of them is really <unk> , but one of them is that a lot of them is that , but one of them is quite a bit more likely to do it .
And that , which is that , that &apos;s kind of an <unk> , where that was going on on its peak on its peak .
Where do we know it ?
Because we asked these people to their <unk> , and they went to a lot of time , &quot; Who am the hell was that ? &quot;
and she was an issue for A B in the <unk> .
So , it &apos;s a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
By the perspective of the <unk> , B was a good time .
So , I mean , I was able to do that patient , and we &apos;ve done some clinical trials , and we &apos;ve done that in a way , and it &apos;s going to be , and it &apos;s going to be , and it &apos;s going to be the <unk> of patient who want to get rid of patient in the box of the slang .
It &apos;s going to lead to that patient , but it &apos;s just a bit of it , and it &apos;s just a bit of it ,
and then , for a few minutes , it &apos;s going to make sure that the <unk> <unk> of patient A &apos;s <unk> is a lot of money , and he &apos;s making sure that the <unk> of patient A is a lot more likely to have a patient or a patient who is a more likely one .
True story ?
And it &apos;s kind of like that kind of relationship , which takes us , and it comes to those talks that we invent .
A <unk> is <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
And that &apos;s very , very important , and in this case , that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> , the <unk> , are they continue to live .
And it was a number of <unk> , one person .
and they ask : &quot; What &apos;s going on by the time ? &quot;
and that &apos;s really easy . They &apos;ve lost forever .
I mean , that &apos;s the most moments of our lives -- and I had that -- you know , which is -- you know , that psychological present moment at a time , like about three seconden . Wat betekent that in a matter of 600 miljoen of them . In a maand of 600,000 . In a maand , is it 600 miljoen .
Those of them were completely genegeerd from their <unk> .
and yet , somehow , you know , that they might have been able to say that they were able to see , when they go to the moment of the speech in the moment ,
It &apos;s that <unk> , which we &apos;re going to focus on in the world ,
and who we were going to think of it was going to be significant , but it &apos;s not that verhaal , which is not that verhaal , which for us .
So , we have the <unk> self , and it &apos;s <unk> and they &apos;re completely different .
The big difference between them is that they deal with time .
By the way of the <unk> self , when you have a vakantie , and that tweede week , that &apos;s when that eerste week , it &apos;s the <unk> vakantie of the <unk> vakantie of the night .
But it doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> self .
So for that <unk> self , it &apos;s a <unk> taste of a happy vakantie of vakantie like that <unk> vakantie , want he &apos;s going to make no new herinneringen .
They don &apos;t know that way .
and that is , in fact , that a critical variabele , which is a critical variabele , which is a <unk> self , or a <unk> self .
Now , the <unk> act , if we don &apos;t want to remember and share and tell them .
It &apos;s that , if you have a patient , that &apos;s when you have a patient , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to tell a patient , that we &apos;ve got two <unk> to two different chirurgen and then besluit welke herinnering , that &apos;s going to give that herinnering , that &apos;s going to be that a lot of who is going to be the child who &apos;s going to be less wrong .
This <unk> doesn &apos;t have a stem in the second .
In fact , we don &apos;t kiezen between a <unk> . We kiezen tussen herinneringen .
and when we think about that , when we think about that future , we think that we don &apos;t think a way .
and we think about our toekomst when we think <unk> herinneringen .
And basically , you know , if you think about it , if a tirannie of the <unk> self , and you can think of it as an <unk> self , and you can think of it as one , that kind of <unk> self <unk> in the past , who doesn &apos;t have <unk> .
I realize that when we go to vakantie that we &apos;re very likely to , it &apos;s going to be that we &apos;re going to take a <unk> in the services of the <unk> self .
And it &apos;s kind of hard to create , I think .
I mean , who really <unk> we or lose our herinneringen ?
This is one that &apos;s argument , which is for that subject to that person &apos;s <unk> self .
And when I think about that , I think I &apos;ve done a couple of years ago in Antarctica , which I &apos;ve done for a couple of years ago in Antarctica , that I had you had <unk> , and I think it was very similar to me , and I think that &apos;s why I think about some other <unk> .
and I was probably wondering whether I had my herinnering with this <unk> trip , I would say about 25 minuten in the afgelopen four years .
Now , when I opened it to the map of the 600 shots that I had had had , I had a week doorgebracht .
So , it &apos;s three weken , and it &apos;s 15 uur .
He schijnt a <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to be a little bit of extreme , that I can tell you , in terms of the little <unk> I had to see on the <unk> of the <unk> , but in fact , als je er more of a real question is , it &apos;s a real question . So , we don &apos;t want to hear the question that we are <unk> .
And I want to think about a <unk> .
And its next week , you know , if you know , at the end of the day , you know , at the end of the day , all of the <unk> of the <unk> , all of you might have become a <unk> medicijn , which is that you will never remember that .
OK , I mean , you know , I mean , you know , I mean , you know , I mean , you know , if you go to a different kind of vakantie , it &apos;s a conflict between both the second of the self , and of course , he was able to figure out how to do this conflict , and it &apos;s really not obvious , want als je denkt dat je in mind , je kind zou kunnen denken , als je denkt dat je in mind , and als je in gedachten
So , when we go to that <unk> , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do for a problem , which is a conversation between the two types of self .
that both of the individual type of self .
It &apos;s really two concepten of happiness that we can apply , one person .
I mean , you can ask : How does this <unk> feel that ?
and then , and then , I ask , who are those moments of death in the <unk> self ?
and they &apos;re all -- fortunately for moment , a really complex proces .
What are those things that can be used to ?
And , trouwens , we &apos;re now able to have a really good idea of happiness for the happiness of the <unk> self .
Now , when you ask someone else &apos;s <unk> self , it &apos;s another one .
This doesn &apos;t mean , who live one person .
This is , who happy , who happy , is that one person , when they think about their own life .
And that &apos;s very different .
So , every one who doesn &apos;t make that view that I think about death of happiness , and I &apos;m about to be a lot of people who &apos;ve been studying whether or not studying that .
And that onderscheid tussen geluk and death of the self is being recognized in the last few years ago , and now , and now , and I &apos;ve turned it into the last few years , and now he was turning those two <unk> .
That Gallup group was a global poll that was more like a half miljoen people , and that &apos;s what they &apos;ve been talking about about their own life and their talk about their expertise .
In the last few years , we &apos;ve begun to learn about the happiness of both the individual .
and that <unk> , which we , I think , have learned that really different .
I mean , who &apos;s happy to know someone who &apos;s going to be there , and they don &apos;t think about it , who don &apos;t really enjoy , who are going to live there and vice versa .
Just for some reason , it is associated with that conflict , which is associated with <unk> .
What it means is that when you come to a person , and you might say , &quot; Hey , zijn vader is a <unk> , hoeveel zou je over his lengte ? &quot;
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , about its size , but he &apos;s probably a lot of onzekerheid .
They &apos;ve got a lot of onzekerheid .
Now , if I told you that a lot of people are like eight up on a perspective of 10 people , you have a lot of onzekerheid of it , who are happy with his <unk> self .
It &apos;s slightly easier .
and we know what that might determine was that condition of death .
And we know , we know , that &apos;s very important , doelstellingen to doelstellingen , doelstellingen .
We know , for example , that happiness means that we &apos;re going to be happy with people who we love , time to doorbrengen with us .
He &apos;s different , but it &apos;s dominant .
And then , when you want to , if you go to the two types of self , when they go to a very different perspective .
And that position that I was here to say , I said , &quot; Well , we really don &apos;t think that we really don &apos;t even think about a <unk> .
It &apos;s a completely different phrase .
Now , very briefly , a different reason , if we think about happiness , we don &apos;t even know that we think about the time when we think about life , and when we think about it .
So , when you ask that particular question , who , who , who are great , who are the guys in California , they don &apos;t have the correct answer .
Now , if you ask this question , if you think that those guys are in CaliforniÃ« happy when you live in Ohio .
And that &apos;s when you think about that , when you think about that in California , you think about the difference between California and others else , and this difference is , in the klimaat .
Now , it doesn &apos;t seem to be very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not very important for the <unk> self , who beslist , who , who are great .
But , if that &apos;s a <unk> self , you might end up , maybe , maybe , maybe a lot of people might go to California .
and it &apos;s really interesting to track , and it was going to go to the kind of thing that go to California , and they &apos;re going to be happy .
So , their <unk> becomes not happy .
We know it .
But one thing that is going to happen . They think that they &apos;re happy , want when they think about it , they were going to think about it , who were really bad at the back in Ohio . And they became that they felt that it was <unk> .
It &apos;s really hard , and I think it comes to think about decisions , and I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m going to tell you that , I &apos;m going to give you a show that is really hard .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thanks . I got a question .
Thank you .
Now , if we had a couple of weken geleden <unk> , I had to say that it was a really interesting conclusie , who had come to that Gallup poll .
Is it something that we can tell you , want I want to make a couple of minuten ?
Daniel <unk> : Thank you .
I think that kind of <unk> , which we have found in the Gallup enquÃªte , is a getal that we didn &apos;t even think .
We found that at the level of the <unk> self .
So , when we were left , we &apos;re able to differentiate that way by the inkomen .
And it turns out that under a inkomen of 60,000 dollars per jaar , for Amerikanen , and it &apos;s a very big steekproef of American , 600 , but it &apos;s a significant representatieve sample , between 600,000 dollar per jaar of 600,000 dollars per jaar of 600,000 dollars per year ,
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars per year , that people are ongelukkig , and they become more likely to become more likely , you &apos;re armer .
And then , we have a very nice line .
I mean , I had the only time that I was there .
What &apos;s going on , it &apos;s obvious , it &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> , but that gebrek aan <unk> , and that gebrek aan <unk> , and we can really , really , really <unk> .
In favor of the others , the <unk> self , you &apos;ll have a different story .
Your more money will make an <unk> man .
It doesn &apos;t work for emotie .
CA : But Danny , in the entire American effort , it &apos;s going to go for a lot of time , vrijheid ,
Now , if people take a look seriously , I mean , I mean , it schijnt everything that I think , it &apos;s going to represent everything that we &apos;re in the face of conflict , and it &apos;s even closer .
So , what about a moment , is that politici , that land , for example , an <unk> who was going to take an <unk> who was going to take out of the seriousness of how ?
DK : Now , I think , I think , I think that he &apos;s punished for that rol in the politiek .
that &apos;s going to be in the Verenigde Staten , not a question , but in the first place , but in the country , they are in the country , and in other countries , in different countries ,
And that &apos;s when they recognize that they think that they think that they think that they think about a lot of time .
And it &apos;s going to come to a long time , and those people are going to have <unk> , of course , and they &apos;re trying to figure out why they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
So , I mean , you can think of happiness really differently , depending on who you think , and if you think of that <unk> self , of course , of course , of the <unk> self .
This is an argument that I think about the next few years .
In the United States , we &apos;ve got to meet the <unk> of the bevolking .
This is , I think , in the next week , in the next two decades of global statistieken .
CA : Well , it seems to me , this <unk> , of course , that I would argue that it <unk> to a kind of great art that I would leave the next few years .
So for example , for that uitvinding of gedragseconomie .
Thanks , Danny <unk> .
I &apos;ve got to talk about energy and the klimaat .
and it really surprised me , want my <unk> <unk> at the expense of vaccins and zaden , for those things , that we &apos;ve got to invent those things that we can invent and create the armste two miljard people into a living room .
But energy and klimaat are very important for these people , and most importantly , if for every others on the planet ,
<unk> , which means that they don &apos;t have to grow their <unk> , and they &apos;re not going to be <unk> . It &apos;s not the only thing that they can &apos;t .
It leads to <unk> . It leads to <unk> . It leads to <unk> .
And then , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> for them .
And again , it &apos;s very important for them .
And so , if you think about one of those things that we might have <unk> , it would be sustainable at least for the most effective .
And that <unk> is about that time .
In fact , that &apos;s where it &apos;s <unk> .
And that <unk> was that IndustriÃ«le Revolutie , and in the 20e eeuw , it was an <unk> case in the 20ste eeuw , and so in fact , we &apos;ve got <unk> , we can restore modern manufacturing , we can restore modern manufacturing .
We &apos;re in a very nice place where we &apos;re in the developing world .
But , if we can reduce the prijs -- we go to a <unk> -- we go into a new barriÃ¨re , and this barriÃ¨re of <unk> .
CO2 warmt on that planeet and that vergelijking , it &apos;s actually a <unk> .
and it <unk> the <unk> CO2 , which is going to lead to <unk> , and that <unk> has some very <unk> effects , and that &apos;s probably going to be an <unk> effect , and that might not be more likely to change that natuurlijke ecosystemen , that those natuurlijke ecosystems can &apos;t change the borders .
Now , that kind of relationship between an <unk> , and it <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s where they make some <unk> , because they have some <unk> , but not very much .
and he &apos;s probably going to have <unk> , who &apos;s going to be the ones that were going to be , but they became very bad .
I &apos;ve got to tell them a bunch of <unk> , and said , &quot; Are we going to go into the right zero ?
Don &apos;t say that about the helft of them , or a quarter ? &quot;
And that antwoord is , if we close at zero , we &apos;ll get those warmer .
And that &apos;s a big uitdaging .
And it &apos;s completely different to say , we have a big <unk> of a big truck , which is a meter of a meter of her , and it &apos;s in the three meter .
And it &apos;s up there , at zero .
So , every year , we <unk> a <unk> <unk> , of 26 miljard ton .
Every single one of the American American people , people who are poor , is less like one .
And gemiddeld , it &apos;s five ton of the planeet .
and we &apos;ve got a little bit of a reality that it comes to zero .
It &apos;s often increasing .
But really , really , really different organizations , and we need to have a <unk> , and we &apos;ve got to reduce the cost of reducing the cost of a vermindering of it .
This is a little bit of a <unk> . A little bit of <unk> , and it &apos;s left left -- CO2 -- that &apos;s going to <unk> an <unk> , and it &apos;s going to depend on the number of people , of the population of the population , of the population of the population , which means every single one of the people who uses their average energy in the population , and the CO2 <unk> , which is per <unk> <unk> .
And then , again , every one of our <unk> and then we think about it , who we have at zero .
and probably , one of the things that I think is very close to zero .
This is a graphic algebra , but we go .
Ten eerste , we &apos;ve seen that population .
Today , <unk> miljard people ,
and it &apos;s going to take a nine miljard <unk> that gets nine miljard of miles .
Now , when we have a lot of different vaccins , that <unk> , and <unk> , we might be able to see 10 percent of them , maybe 10 percent of them , but at the time , we see a helling for 1.3 .
The tweede factor that we use .
It &apos;s all that , that &apos;s going to take food , which we &apos;re eating , <unk> , TV , etc .
It &apos;s very good , and it &apos;s <unk> , which means that they want to take that services to the planeet .
And it &apos;s really cool ,
In the developing world , in the top of the year , we might be able to <unk> , and we will be able to <unk> , but gemiddeld will increase in the population of the population of the country , and that will increase in a greater number of that services per persoon .
So , here we see a very common deal . So he &apos;s going to notice that he &apos;s going to be able to read that way ?
and that student , they don &apos;t go , and they go through their <unk> and read their <unk> .
Now , on efficiÃ«ntie , the E , which he &apos;s going to take on , it &apos;s a good news .
We &apos;ve got something that doesn &apos;t come up .
And for example , for example , of course , that <unk> <unk> , of course , of other <unk> , in the developing world , for example , in the developing world , for example , for example , that they can dramatically reduce their <unk> at the top of their body .
Some of their services , for example , 90 percent .
In others , it uses <unk> , which is <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> : <unk> , <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , it &apos;s a lot of smaller .
Anyway , when we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we may have some power for a factor three of that , or maybe a factor of six or perhaps one of maybe six .
But for the first three different things , we &apos;ve gone by 26 miljard <unk> 13 miljard ton , and it &apos;s not enough .
Now , if you think of the vierde factor of -- and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> -- it &apos;s that a lot of CO2 -- that &apos;s a lot of CO2 , which is a <unk> .
And it turns out that , of course , you can access it from scratch .
You know , if you &apos;re verbrand , you don &apos;t .
If you &apos;re drinking aardgas , it doesn &apos;t .
Fast all of the world &apos;s electricity consumption , we &apos;re driving CO2 emissions today , or they <unk> .
And then , we &apos;ve got to go to a global level , we need a nieuw systeem .
We &apos;ve got <unk> .
I mean , when I <unk> the term &quot; wonder &quot; , I don &apos;t want it .
The <unk> is a wonder . The PC is a wonder .
The Internet and that services are a wonder .
and that people have died here for some of this wonder .
But typically , it &apos;s not a <unk> , which is a wonder when you &apos;ve got a wonder .
So , typically , it &apos;s almost like that , and some of them are going to , other not .
In this case , we need to <unk> and wonder and wonder , you can get a wonder .
So I had to ask myself , who can I really <unk> ?
Does he mean a <unk> , a demo , which is a demonstration of the real people here ?
I had a lot that I had to remember when I was about muggen , and if I was able to have those guys .
And that sense was for them to really express , that he was able to live in a human life .
But for energy , I saw it .
I decided that this <unk> <unk> had my <unk> <unk> for this <unk> <unk> .
Here are some of these <unk> vuurvliegjes .
and I told you , I told me , they don &apos;t want to return . They probably won &apos;t .
Now , he may have all the <unk> who , but they don &apos;t have any <unk> .
So , we &apos;ve got three and a few who can , one of them who &apos;s going to have a partial set of <unk> , and yet , as it turns out , I have a lot of new <unk> , where people are going to come to school , I see that really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , to me ,
I had <unk> , <unk> , fusie and <unk> .
This is perhaps a <unk> contribution , and when they are willing to give them a lot of <unk> that I verwacht , it &apos;s kind of , but my <unk> here , that we have all of that <unk> , and we can &apos;t blame them , because they don &apos;t want any of us , want it &apos;s <unk> .
And when we look at the brand of fossiele brandstoffen , you know , verbranding of sustainable gas , or gas .
So , what we &apos;ve done is that , maybe , it is , but it &apos;s not , but it &apos;s not . In fact , it &apos;s all the CO2 , it &apos;s going to be the <unk> of the <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> , and in the rest of the room , and hoopt zich on .
There are some <unk> , which is that at a 60 percent -- 80 percent , but it &apos;s 100 percent , but it &apos;s 100 percent , and it &apos;s about 100 percent , and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> for that <unk> of CO2 , is a big uitdaging , but that &apos;s a big uitdaging here , but this is a big uitdaging here .
So , how does it get it ?
So , how can a difference , a few miljarden times a lot of difference if any Art of afval , an <unk> and others else ?
It &apos;s a lot of volume .
It &apos;s a really hard <unk> .
So , next week , <unk> .
It also has three big problems , and that <unk> , especially in <unk> countries , and that question of why you really want to feel that it doesn &apos;t really play something really going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be a <unk> , including the <unk> of the gas .
and then , I mean , how did I think about it ?
Because , however , it doesn &apos;t really exist , it &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
that people are getting better . It &apos;s 10 : 20,000 -- 10 : 20,000 -- 10 : 20,000 -- 10 : 20,000 , <unk> .
So , three very nice things , which is an <unk> , and that they want to deal with them .
And those three of the <unk> I &apos;ve drawn .
that they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
and also , although they &apos;ve got it -- although it &apos;s really cool , they have some <unk> .
So , for one of these things , that &apos;s where these technologies create dramatically larger than that .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s probably going to talk about a lot of <unk> , 1,000 miles of time .
Similarly , these <unk> <unk> ,
And that sun doesn &apos;t seem to be the whole day , but it doesn &apos;t seem to be any given time , and they don &apos;t have the wind .
And then , when we go to that bronnen , it &apos;s a route , which is a way that you don &apos;t want to access it .
Now , here we have a lot of <unk> . It &apos;s like that , for example , that energiebron is like that energiebron in the country of the land , and it &apos;s not just that technology , we &apos;ve got to deal with that technology , you &apos;ve got to deal with that kind of energy .
and it &apos;s <unk> .
And for that dimensie , I had all the different types of batteries that have been aangemaakt , and that &apos;s where it comes to , it was an <unk> , computer computer , computers , <unk> , for everything . And that &apos;s what I had to do with the whole cell phones that we &apos;re now , not as 10 minutes of the <unk> .
So , we &apos;ve got a big doorbraak here , which is something that I think about a factor 100 will be 100 more likely , if that deal .
It &apos;s not really impossible , but it &apos;s not just .
This is what happens when we &apos;ve done that <unk> system , we say 20 percent of them -- 30 percent of the <unk> .
So , if you go to 100 percent that go for 100 percent of them , you &apos;ve got to have a special design system .
So , where are we going to go : &quot; What &apos;s that really ?
A &quot; <unk> project ? &quot; Who are we going ?
So , what we &apos;ve got to do is , a lot of people who are doing that .
In every case , we need to have minstens 100 of that ,
I mean , for some time , you say that it &apos;s crazy ! It &apos;s good .
I think here in the TED community , it &apos;s a lot of people who are going on .
Bill Gross has been several of them , and that &apos;s another one called <unk> who had great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , in several times , geÃ¯nvesteerd in several times , and I &apos;ve done some interesting things and I &apos;ve tried to help .
Nathan <unk> , and I financieren one of these things , which , perhaps , was that science path .
It &apos;s some kind of innovaties in <unk> , <unk> , vloeibaar .
And that &apos;s not a lot of time , in the process of spending a lot of time , it &apos;s not a great coincidence , which is really good .
That <unk> , which means that , in a part of a condition , that &apos;s one percent , which is one percent , which we decided to find that 99 percent , which we decided to find that 99 percent , that <unk> .
This is a really crazy notion .
But in fact , we had a long time for that , but in fact , I didn &apos;t want to pretend that it was , but in fact , he would have a modern supercomputer , and it was a modern supercomputer , and it &apos;s still a modern supercomputer , it &apos;s going to be the <unk> .
and that 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better ,
In fact , we &apos;re drinking the afval , and you can use the afval of the consumption of consumption .
In the way over and over time , you &apos;ll find it . It &apos;s a nice thing .
So , that of uranium <unk> , a little bit that a <unk> .
And you see , it &apos;s a type of <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
and they lost it .
Here &apos;s a foto in Kentucky in Kentucky .
This is the afval , 99 percent . Man , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , which means it &apos;s <unk> uranium .
And that <unk> that land for the U.S. for several millennia .
and when we <unk> goedkoop and then <unk> , you can see enough gas for those rest of the planeet .
Now , we have some uitdagingen , but it &apos;s a couple of uitdagingen , but it &apos;s a couple of examples that we &apos;ve nodig hebben ,
Think of that , who we had to see our success .
Who could this testament to us ?
And then , we &apos;re going to go to a target , and then we &apos;ve got to talk about the <unk> .
We think about an 80 percent of 2050 to 2050 .
And it &apos;s really important , really important ,
between the other 20 percent of them in poor countries , and they &apos;re also going to be <unk> , and they &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> , and it &apos;s still going to be a <unk> .
So , for this 80 percent , that will be that <unk> , including countries who are China , their <unk> completely veranderen .
And that other note says , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to use that <unk> technology , of course , of them in all their <unk> , and we &apos;re waiting for them .
It &apos;s great .
This is a <unk> of these <unk> .
So , if we go back to that , if we go back to that by 2020 , that &apos;s what should be done by 2020 ?
And it was more than both of these things .
And we need to use those <unk> that we &apos;re going to need to go to the <unk> . Man , and we &apos;re less likely to <unk> , where we &apos;re going to be more likely to get those <unk> <unk> .
But there &apos;s this <unk> for those things that we &apos;re going to do , which doesn &apos;t really matter to the big <unk> , we don &apos;t even know , of it , of course , of that other , that those other , that those different things that they can , that those different changes of innovatie ,
These doorbraken , we &apos;ve been able to track it for <unk> , and we can tell , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
and he has some great <unk> .
This Al Gore boek &quot; We have that <unk> , &quot; and David <unk> : Sustainable Energy .
and they &apos;re going to go into it , and they go into a context where this breed <unk> can be <unk> , want we &apos;ve got <unk> .
He &apos;s going to have some people .
This is a wens .
And a very sad lesson , which is that we invent technology .
So , if you give me a wens for that 50 years , I had to go to a poll that I had to call the president , a vaccine , and I &apos;m going to name it , of course , I can kiezen to the wens , which is , of course , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the largest impact .
So , if we don &apos;t have this wens , it &apos;s going to be <unk> between the long-term trends of the lung , and they &apos;re going to be going to be bad among the U.S. and China , between poor and the poor , and all of the major men of the two miljard of dollars .
So , what would we do ?
So for that condition , I <unk> ?
We &apos;ve got to use it for more <unk> .
and when countries are in their areas when they <unk> , they don &apos;t want to talk about CO2 .
I mean , you know , you know , that <unk> <unk> , and they were really geschokt of it that they &apos;ve been <unk> for that innovatieve <unk> ,
We &apos;ve got <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> business .
We &apos;ve got to move that message .
and we &apos;ve got to go to dialoog , and we need to create <unk> , and then those things , which is that , that those things , that they &apos;ve done .
It &apos;s a more important thing , but I think , I think , we can leave it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thanks .
So , I want to tell you a lot . Just for a little bit better , we can tell you a little bit more or less , right ?
Bill Gates : So , Bill Gates : To build a supercomputer , all of the great wetenschappers , we &apos;ve done a few 10 million . And when we &apos;ve done our <unk> , we have to test it in a <unk> reactor , and when we &apos;ve done our hardware in a <unk> reactor , it &apos;s just in the <unk> .
And this is what a <unk> is , for the first time , for example , for example , for example , for example , miljarden dollars , that <unk> and the site of the site ,
And then the case that is , when it was going to be that , when it was <unk> , it &apos;s all <unk> , that <unk> , which is that <unk> , who are <unk> , who we know .
CA : So , really , really , really to understand : It &apos;s really hard to take up to the ground in a way that &apos;s going to take a sheet of <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s going to go to a <unk> <unk> , and then start the process of starting ?
BG : All right . Today , I &apos;ve got to <unk> the reactor now , and it &apos;s probably the size of the reactor , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> . This is where you open it .
But if we had a very low gas station , I mean , it &apos;s 60 years of <unk> -- I think it &apos;s a <unk> -- that &apos;s when you begraven , it doesn &apos;t .
And it &apos;s there , and it &apos;s 60 years long , and it &apos;s finished .
CA : So , it &apos;s a <unk> , which is an issue for the <unk> .
BG : Yeah . So , you know , it &apos;s going to go through the <unk> , and you can put it into it -- it &apos;s going to be a lot of the <unk> -- in the next reactor -- in the next reactor , and in the next reactor you <unk> .
And we start from that afval , which is already in the <unk> of the <unk> of the grid , and that &apos;s our <unk> .
So , it was , for some reason , it was a real issue that we &apos;re in our tracks , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to see in our tracks , and it &apos;s going to be dramatic in the process .
CA : But when you &apos;ve had to talk about different human beings in the world ,
I mean , why should it really change ?
BG : So , we don &apos;t have a <unk> in a position , and he &apos;s probably a lot more interesting <unk> for everything called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and he &apos;s going to have a lot of interest , and that people were in Europe , India , China , I was here , and I was here and I had the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m optimistic . I mean , that was the Fransen and Japanners who were in that way .
This is another one that was done .
And it &apos;s a more radical step , but it &apos;s a little bit of an <unk> reactor , and some of the country is gebouwd , and it &apos;s only one of them , which is a very literal reactor , right ?
CA : In your mind , you know , and if you look , and what about the time , and what about a lot of time a lot of time ?
BG : So , we &apos;ve got one of these <unk> , <unk> things , which are very low , we &apos;ve got 20 years of doing that , we 20 years into a <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we have to see that <unk> <unk> , which we have <unk> .
and , you know , <unk> , when all of the things go , and it &apos;s a really bad thing , it &apos;s hard .
So , fortunately , it &apos;s about several of these governments , and we &apos;ve been able to have honderden , which we &apos;ve got to do that change , who are going to work for that change for their piloten , that they can change their piloten .
and it &apos;s probably going to be the best , when it was going to be different , want then we could use a <unk> .
In any case , we need a problem .
CA : So , some of the great heights of doorbraken , is that it &apos;s most likely to know ?
BG : A <unk> is that <unk> .
It was also that it was not that <unk> , but it probably won &apos;t matter .
In <unk> , it &apos;s other innovatieve bedrijven .
So , we know , we don &apos;t know that way , we don &apos;t know who this job , but er is that <unk> , it &apos;s a new benadering .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is a little bit lastig , but maybe that &apos;s what we say .
And it &apos;s also different , but it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and that &apos;s because of that , we can say a <unk> , and that &apos;s because of the problem of the problem , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like the power of the world , and those things are the ones that are <unk> in the country and other things , in a <unk> .
CA : So , if it doesn &apos;t work , it was ?
Are we going to have <unk> <unk> , and trying to change that <unk> ?
BG : So , when we go into this situation , it &apos;s like , if we had to have teveel gegeten , and even a hartaanval , it &apos;s like a hartaanval . So , what do I think about it ? Well , maybe it was an <unk> of <unk> .
And it &apos;s a <unk> that comes to <unk> , which means that they &apos;re going to take a different set of technieken for that opwarming , and it &apos;s 20 of 30 years that we spend 20 of 30 and 30 years of time .
It &apos;s just a <unk> .
Man hoopt : We don &apos;t need to have it .
Some of the people , I don &apos;t want to think about their <unk> , want one who was able to do that , is that maybe that maybe lui power , we want to eat , want it &apos;s going to be that one who is going to have <unk> .
I don &apos;t know , of course , if it &apos;s slim , when it comes to this issue of this problem , but er is a <unk> in <unk> , of course , of course , when those things are going to be better , of course , when those things are sneller , when we will ,
CA : <unk> : So , does one of the two sentences for that , maybe for some of that , maybe for them ?
BG : So , he &apos;s going to live that geese in completely different kampen .
So , those who have wetenschappelijke argument , it &apos;s very small .
Now , if they don &apos;t , it &apos;s going to be an <unk> effect that they &apos;ve got to do that ?
It &apos;s very , very few things that they can tell you , whether they can tell them a child in a million .
This <unk> here is that at AIDS .
I &apos;m going to power the word , and they &apos;re probably going to pay it .
And that &apos;s why , als je all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , of course , in a way , that &apos;s actually going to be a lot of the <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be that that <unk> is not even <unk> . It &apos;s not the <unk> scenario , and in the opkomende world , that &apos;s not a great drama .
And that really is , this onzekerheid of this problem ,
But my dream here is , if you can , if you can do this economisch , and that &apos;s when they go back and forth and say that I want to say that it &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> , I was to say that it was not a <unk> , I had to kill it , want het is goedkoper dan that kind .
CA : And it was a little bit of the <unk> <unk> argument , that when all of that <unk> and Energy <unk> , all of that <unk> <unk> , all those other targets that are going to lead to , those other targets that are involved in malaria , which is that it &apos;s a domme verspilling that we can do .
BG : Well , that &apos;s a <unk> argument for that onderzoek -- I say that the United States <unk> 10 miljard dollars per year , if they &apos;re going to do that -- it &apos;s not dramatic .
and that &apos;s something that we don &apos;t have .
I mean , when you go to a lot of <unk> , and here you can , at least at least , when you &apos;ve got to do this , it &apos;s not economisch , and it &apos;s doing it for me .
It &apos;s because , you know , it &apos;s very quick for an <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and I think that we &apos;ve gone to trying to change more or less .
So , if that <unk> , that man krijgt , it &apos;s a very big <unk> , and it &apos;s not going to be one of those rijken .
I mean , every one of us here could take five of us for our energy supply without any of us .
Now , for those onderste two miljard days , it &apos;s a ramp .
and think about it .
So now , what &apos;s new <unk> : &quot; Well , why does that onderzoek not more <unk> ? &quot;
There will be a lot of time , because of the <unk> of the <unk> , but there is a very random team , and it &apos;s now going to <unk> it .
And it &apos;s a <unk> , which I think .
And that onderzoek , it &apos;s kind of crazy , who <unk> .
CA : Bill , I think I &apos;ve been talking to all of these people here , when I &apos;m going to say , I know , I &apos;m really sure that your wens will be true .
BG : Dankjewel .
I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about a couple of maanden that I had a book for a <unk> magazine .
I mean , I had my <unk> <unk> , but I was in my mind , but I was with the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , and I had a lot of my <unk> in my life , which is why it really betekent .
I &apos;m going to read it .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> : &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
I had a <unk> that I had a <unk> voice , and I was able to laugh out , it was belachelijk , but I was just waiting for &quot; <unk> . &quot; I didn &apos;t want to go to &quot; <unk> , &quot; and I was able to stop him from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> emotionele shock .
This was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I thought I had thought that that is a <unk> .
But actually , it was a <unk> in the early 1980s , when I came back to my school school , and I began to build my own <unk> in my country , and in some sense , in addition to the other kids , and in the rest of the world for me .
and God , I didn &apos;t want to use a <unk> .
I mean , I was going to take a thing that I was going to call a world that I was born into a world who had someone who had a human being who would make an <unk> change in <unk> , but now I &apos;m going to have to share some of my choices and avonturen that I &apos;ve known for .
I was wondering that I was going to go to that <unk> of 2009 , and I had to think that I &apos;m going to be a <unk> note .
Here &apos;s that <unk> versie of this <unk> .
<unk> is not much better .
And especially in most of that both of these two words between &quot; Near <unk> &quot; and &quot; go &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
But it &apos;s not just that words .
This is what we think about those people who think we &apos;re talking about .
And it comes to those positions , which is in the very simple position , and who we take these positions .
Our language affects us , and who we see that wereld and those people around us .
So , some of the <unk> samenlevingen , including those Grieken , and that Grieken , and <unk> , they felt that a sense of whether it was a great deal for a great deal , want it was <unk> .
So , what are we going to do : &quot; What is a human being , of course , <unk> people ? &quot;
So , just for example , one of the people who might have <unk> as kind of kind of <unk> , they can &apos;t demand them , they &apos;re going to <unk> .
So , if I didn &apos;t , you know , I wouldn &apos;t be cut down .
There was a man who opened up in front of me , was my company <unk> . It was my <unk> .
There &apos;s Dr . <unk> , which is a <unk> , whose name is that , who might not be able to <unk> ,
and Dr . <unk> had a lot of darkness and it was for that job , and it was for that job .
I was that time that I was in a ziekenhuis in a ziekenhuis , I was very happy .
I was able to hold individual oefeningen , and I had a lot of my <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in the whole second , I used to <unk> my <unk> . And I used to <unk> that tapes .
and imagine , I was like a <unk> kind of <unk> kind of <unk> with Dr . <unk> , and it probeerde deze oefeningen te stoppen , <unk> .
And one of a sudden , there was a lot of time when I was there , that exercise was just <unk> and <unk> -- and I said , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re an <unk> , <unk> and young meisjes , and it &apos;s a <unk> of one of these tapes .
and when I <unk> it , I give 100 dollar . &quot;
It was just a very nice trick of Dr . <unk> , and I made that oefeningen that I didn &apos;t want to do when I was going to , I didn &apos;t want the <unk> of the <unk> meisjes in the middle of the meeting , but in fact , <unk> <unk> .
and I &apos;m going to ask myself today , who became very similar to me , and I had a lot of my mind and <unk> young meisjes my <unk> <unk> and I had me imagining myself as an <unk> , <unk> and <unk> person .
It &apos;s just an example of that , or some of them who live in <unk> in <unk> who can help create a kind of kind .
But who made those <unk> voorbeelden from the <unk> hypotheses , our language , we don &apos;t want to ask a space , but what we would say , it was one that we would have .
Our ability to <unk> our values , which was very similar to a developing society that was generated by a technologische verandering .
From an <unk> perspective , you can say that my benen , which is <unk> for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is how people can afford their ability to use their ability to use their ability to use their ability to use their ability to help , not to talk about Social <unk> platforms , and that they can define their own <unk> in their own fashion , in their own sense , in their own culture , themselves .
and over the course of the world , that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
Now , perhaps this technological transformatie is more likely to recognize that it was a different set of different Truth , which is that every one of the people who is really <unk> and really <unk> , and that menselijke vermogen , and that menselijke vermogen , our greatest Plus .
That &apos;s an interesting thing that people can think about -- that &apos;s a really interesting verhaal , want to tell me that people ask me again , who I <unk> met <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;ve got iets <unk> : &quot; This is a set of <unk> for me , and I really felt that this is why .
This set of <unk> , and it &apos;s still going to be a <unk> , and it takes a bit of a challenge for it , and when it comes to a challenge , it doesn &apos;t really matter to a <unk> experience , and when my own life won &apos;t change the <unk> <unk> , I had to live in a little bit of my own life in my life .
But that reality is , we &apos;ve got to change . We have a lot of it , or they are fysiek fysiek , emotioneel of it , or both of it is fysiek .
I &apos;m suggesting that it &apos;s okay .
<unk> , we don &apos;t have a obstakel , which we &apos;ve got to <unk> to our <unk> .
<unk> are our levens .
and I &apos;m very similar to my own ,
Now , I want to realize that there are very <unk> , and it &apos;s not just enough , but there &apos;s a lot of time .
and I don &apos;t want to go to that effect , and I &apos;m going to make an awful lot of these <unk> of people .
It &apos;s in the <unk> and <unk> , and they are just <unk> real and every one of these things , but it &apos;s not , of course , we don &apos;t know , of course , of course , of course , we don &apos;t know of it .
We &apos;re not just going to be responsible for those people who we &apos;re going to love , but we &apos;re going to <unk> them , but they &apos;ll challenge it .
and we don &apos;t blame our kids for their children , when we give them a sense of it .
Man has two things : I mean , that &apos;s a <unk> thing : that &apos;s one of the other American <unk> , one who &apos;s going to be more rational , and I &apos;m <unk> .
and specifically , that &apos;s a really real and <unk> handicap that I &apos;ve been trying to figure out , is that that world will continue to make a lot of time , it &apos;s going to be my ability to describe this definities .
In our careers , those people who are facing us , who are facing us , and they feel beautiful , and they feel great about their own operations that they had to focus on , and they have a metaphor for a focus for them , we &apos;re going to give a <unk> that someone is being <unk> .
And perhaps , the <unk> concept , it &apos;s just going to <unk> in a piece of time , and who we herstellen it , for every one of them , for every single one of them , is that one of the more or less human handicap is .
So , if we don &apos;t treat a human and we don &apos;t have any of the different things and our ability and our ability and identify , we &apos;re going to pick up the natuurlijke battle , which they might have .
We <unk> a people who have an opportunity for our maatschappij .
And then we &apos;ve got to see that <unk> , and we &apos;ll focus on all of the challenges that we focus on .
But then , I mean , it was , but it was , of course , it was between the sense of our <unk> and our great <unk> , a link .
We don &apos;t want to go to a <unk> period of time , of course , we don &apos;t even know , we don &apos;t even have to change them , we don &apos;t want them to go through the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , I might argue that we don &apos;t really want to ask him , but we don &apos;t really need to be <unk> , but we open it to a <unk> , we put it into a <unk> , we put them into <unk> , we can put it into a <unk> .
and , maybe we , we &apos;re going to do it , <unk> like a nature of nature , and we can see it , and we can tell them that they don &apos;t affect their presence .
In that jaar , we vieren 200 , verjaardag of Charles Darwin , and when 150 years ago , Darwin had Darwin , in my view , in my view , in a very extreme context in the human condition .
I would say it was <unk> : not the sterkste ones , and it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s going to be <unk> , but that &apos;s where we can change borders .
<unk> , creativiteit .
not just for Darwin &apos;s work , we understand that that vaardigheid of the people , and in fact , <unk> , of course , of the conflict of mind , of conflict of conflict .
Again , again , verandering , and <unk> , and that &apos;s where people are .
and perhaps , we know , from that block , from that block , when we were <unk> .
But , perhaps , that &apos;s a sense of <unk> , which is a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own .
We can give ourselves a <unk> .
We can create a new betekenis , which is when we go to a new betekenis , which is going to happen when you go into a serious moment .
I mean , we &apos;ll be able to see if change .
<unk> are for a change that we haven &apos;t yet aangepast .
I think , I think , the greatest schade that we have <unk> , is that we think that we &apos;re going to be normal .
So again , how is it normal ?
He &apos;s not normal .
It &apos;s that <unk> , that <unk> , but not the usual case , and that poor , you know , you know poor , grijze first , if they really know ?
I think it doesn &apos;t .
So it was great , if we could take that mindset of the city in a second of the range of opportunities , and it would give them a little bit more likely to forms to forms , and then we would have those krachten of <unk> , and they uitnodigen them out , and they uitnodigen them out , and they uitnodigen them out their own best and their <unk> in that maatschappij .
<unk> , that we &apos;ve got to have people , or that leden of the leden of our maatschappij , and they &apos;ve got to earn an <unk> <unk> .
And he was able to see that that Neanderthalers , 60,000 years ago , are the ones who &apos;ve been able to <unk> that Neanderthal types of trauma , and they might have been <unk> , and they might want that in fact , because that <unk> in the <unk> of human rights was significant .
They didn &apos;t look like that .
A few years ago , I went into a <unk> in a <unk> in the &quot; Red Zone &quot; in the noordoosten of Pennsylvania , and I was standing there for a <unk> <unk> .
It was a zomer , and I had <unk> .
and I &apos;m watching , who a guy standing behind me , &quot; After it , it &apos;s like Aimee <unk> . &quot;
And I <unk> myself and I see this oudere man . I had no understanding how it is .
I said , &quot; Pardon , Sir , we know ? I can &apos;t remember that . &quot;
and said , &quot; Well , yeah , you know , I don &apos;t know .
If I looked for you , I got to my mother &apos;s mama . &quot;
Oh , it .
and it &apos;s going to <unk> it .
This was Dr . <unk> , a man who was just telling my mama my mother about this day , want I was very typical , until two weken was my verjaardag .
This was my mother for <unk> , and my mother was my mother , and my wife , my father , who bracht me around in the world , who had no .
And I was born without a <unk> <unk> , and my brother had <unk> , and I had just a few tenen , and I had a few tenen in the rest of my body , and it was a little bit of <unk> that vreemdelingen <unk> .
I said , &quot; I was able to tell him , &quot; I was able to tell him , I had to say to him , and I didn &apos;t even have <unk> that anyone else who was different , who was different from their own children , of course , and they &apos;ve never come to a <unk> . &quot;
I was really fascinated by my whole kind of <unk> <unk> , of course , of course , of course , I had a <unk> in the tweede klas in the Tweede grade , of course , I had to <unk> my studiebeurs to <unk> in the club of my organization was <unk> <unk> , and hij gebruikte these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> Medical School .
and there was this <unk> <unk> , the X factor , which is the <unk> factor of the menselijk <unk> .
I mean , you can &apos;t really appreciate that , who might argue that there &apos;s a factor of some of the great people in a human lifestyle .
and Dr . <unk> said , &quot; I told you , &quot; Well , I had learned that kind of children , when they didn &apos;t have a whole time , and when they don &apos;t have a whole time , and when they give them a little bit of an <unk> , when they kind of <unk> their children , they could help kids .
Now , you know , Dr . <unk> ,
There was also a lot of time that it was an old man , and who had to deal with it , two different things .
and I had a lot of my thinking that I had when she was 15 years ago , when she was 15 years old , I had my <unk> for <unk> and <unk> <unk> , I had no chance .
I wanted to go to a time .
Now , when you ask me today , I &apos;m not sure .
And that &apos;s what happens , I had a little bit of my benen , and I had a little bit of my benen , and I don &apos;t have the <unk> .
And perhaps of course , of course , of course , of course , I was going to have some people who have a lot of people who have taken me in my community , in my face , in my face , who were going to <unk> me , of course , <unk> .
Now , you know , it &apos;s really just one of the people who can tell you , who can tell you that your krachten can <unk> your powers , and they are .
So , if you take it into somebody else , and when you get it into somebody else , we think that the human spirit is even <unk> -- when you do it , and for someone at a moment , and for someone at a moment , it &apos;s a <unk> professor .
They put them together , and they opened up .
and that &apos;s going to be an opinion of the <unk> , &quot; he says &quot; <unk> . &quot;
It means that , in one of the things , that &apos;s in one of the things that are <unk> .
So , again , how are we going to have <unk> ?
In the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , we had <unk> in <unk> .
This is called &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; in the United States , we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
that students were becoming <unk> .
And that a student became more likely to test <unk> , which became more effective .
and then they had a <unk> time for a student who had a &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; that for a long time , and they said , &quot; Well , they were really good . They were really slim . &quot; They were really slim .
And I mean , we <unk> it to a hart to hear a hart , which is that vice <unk> , they were just enough .
and , again , it was after three maanden .
but just those who were still in school , or , afgezien of the kids who had school school ,
Now , there was a lot of that study that those leerkrachten were not <unk> .
that teachers didn &apos;t know ,
and told them , if they were that <unk> , and that &apos;s what those students are making , and they give them a lot of them , and they treat them .
The single real world is a <unk> mind , a <unk> geest , and it &apos;s not going to be more likely . There &apos;s no hoop more . There &apos;s not a lot of more <unk> to our natuurlijke , <unk> <unk> and our <unk> <unk> .
But when we do it , it is going to help ourselves , we have to hopen ourselves to survive , and other people are going to keep up and forth and other people around us are going to be really good , it &apos;s going to change our krachten .
So , if a mind , if a mind , we can create a new reality and a new set of <unk> .
I &apos;m going to end with a gedicht , which is a <unk> dichters called <unk> in 14 <unk> , and my vriend Jacques <unk> has been told , &quot; God , the God , the only four <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; Every single kind of God knows God , God , no God , God , no God , no God , of course , de god of the <unk> God , of course , hij zegt : &quot; Hey , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
So , I &apos;m going to go ahead . Thanks .
