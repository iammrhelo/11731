Vor a few Jahren , Peter <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> map .
The <unk> .
The answer is , for example , <unk> from four to four people have a huge amount of <unk> , a range of <unk> , a <unk> , a Meter platform , a Meter Seil , a way .
The Marshmallow was there .
And , again , again , again , again , it &apos;s a good thing to do , but the answer to the answer to people , we have to <unk> , very quickly .
And so , because I remember thinking about this , I , like , &quot; <unk> in <unk> . &quot;
And what &apos;s a great Erfolg .
And so , in fact , I &apos;ve been working on about 70 <unk> in about 70 &apos;s most of the world , with the whole of the most important , and , like , &quot; <unk> of Fortune <unk> . &quot;
And so the case , in fact , there is a very exciting reaction to you , and I will have some of them with you .
The main reason is , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of people going to be a lot .
You &apos;d like to spend , for example , you &apos;re going to have <unk> , <unk> .
Dan do we Pläne , <unk> .
You <unk> and we <unk> and we <unk> .
And the größten Teil of the time , they would sit down with their <unk> .
And am Ende , after the time , it &apos;s going to get someone &apos;s Marshmallow , you know , he &apos;s going to get there a lot , with a <unk> , and <unk> .
They bewundern their work .
But , in fact , it &apos;s true , like , &quot; You know , &quot; he &apos;s going to &quot; Oh oh , &quot; because the <unk> , &quot; because it &apos;s the <unk> , &quot; and it &apos;s going to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> people , you know , &quot; Oh &quot; Oh , &quot; oh , &quot; <unk> like others .
What the actual schlimmsten of the schlimmsten is with a <unk> .
You know , we &apos;re going to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they do quite a bit of math <unk> .
And it turns out , well , it &apos;s a lot of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
And the best of the most important to them are <unk> <unk> .
All right .
And Peter tells us , no one &apos;s not going to be the höchsten <unk> .
That &apos;s how we &apos;re going to have to think , &quot; What are you going to do ? What do you do ? &quot;
<unk> Antwort is , &quot; No one of the kids at the <unk> of the spaghetti <unk> . &quot; Right .
It takes no longer a time with <unk> .
It &apos;s a story .
And so it &apos;s like , dass Ökonomen ausgebildet werden , um die einzige richtige Lösung zu finden .
And they &apos;re going to work .
You know , was , like , if you &apos;re going to , like , &quot; You know , we don &apos;t have any time . &quot;
It &apos;s a <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> ?
The <unk> differently ...
So , let &apos;s start with a journalist .
They are <unk> , and we ate neuer Prototypen ...
And so with the Marshmallow , with the Marshmallow , you have to have to be able to have a lot of good Prototypen with a way .
<unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , as a result of <unk> .
In fact , if you have a brain , a lot of the kids , you know , and I would never want to do it .
That &apos;s how they take a couple of <unk> .
You know , you know , you &apos;d like to have the <unk> .
The Durchschnitt for the world is about 50 centimeters ...
<unk> , he &apos;s going to be able to <unk> , <unk> it , but no longer .
<unk> , like the meisten Erwachsenen .
How do you do it best ?
<unk> and Ingenieure , <unk> .
The world &apos;s <unk> that I &apos;m looking at a range .
And why ? That &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
CEO ’ s , I think it &apos;s good at the Durchschnitt .
And so it &apos;s interesting : when you &apos;re working on the Team , we &apos;ve got to <unk> , you know , you know .
<unk> . You &apos;re going to see the Team and thinking , &quot; That &apos;s going to work . &quot;
You know , you &apos;re going to see how it &apos;s possible .
Because it &apos;s going to be a lot of them .
They manage the Prozess .
And every year , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of the reaction to the cost of the <unk> , okay .
<unk> and shared diversity suffer from the <unk> .
Now , when ever , first 10 Teams , it &apos;s going to have been doing at the end of the <unk> <unk> .
And I kept thinking about it .
I think we &apos;d like to do it .
And I would like to <unk> 10,000 dollars on the <unk> .
And was , how would you have been doing this ?
How did he ?
The first one .
No , neither got the <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> from , for example , a <unk> , what genug , what are doing , get out of it .
And what &apos;s interesting about it is a relative <unk> .
We &apos;ve been dealing with dieselben Studenten .
And was , how would you see that ?
That &apos;s why , actually , you know , the <unk> <unk> .
And the whole thing about the schlimmsten Team of the best .
They &apos;ve been doing the höchsten <unk> in the unprecedented age .
And that &apos;s a lot of a bad , for example , for the <unk> of <unk> and Erfolg .
Now , what are you going to have to say , &quot; Why do you have to think about that , &quot; I mean , you might have thought about the <unk> of <unk> ?
The last thing is , I &apos;ve got a lot of digital <unk> and feelings , and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And the <unk> behind them , and then , you know , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Now , fair , you know , at least , you know , every day , really ?
In the <unk> , a lot of the same kind , a lot , a variety of music , the best way to <unk> the best Prototyp .
And so it &apos;s like the value of the way the way that this was so simple .
And for example , like <unk> , there are <unk> .
You know , you &apos;re going to see , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to <unk> the <unk> .
He &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
He &apos;s a couple of reasons that have to <unk> , and you know how to <unk> , and you know , you know .
He &apos;s <unk> .
And the <unk> is , I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> .
You know , the <unk> of all kinds of species , and , like , &quot; You know , I think , &quot; and it &apos;s a lot of the <unk> and the <unk> .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , a little shot of the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; Oh , &quot; <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s a tremendous amount .
Thank you .
Now , we don &apos;t have a lot of the <unk> , a very large <unk> , a &quot; cool &quot; <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
And everyone here will come here .
You know , you &apos;d like to <unk> at the time at the time , and you &apos;re not there .
I &apos;m going to be honest , and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; I &apos;ve been doing a lot of a couple of students , and all of them will come back .
You &apos;re all going to have to come out of the time , or &quot; The American <unk> &quot; .
I &apos;m not .
I really feel like he &apos;s a case in <unk> , <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to stay inside .
But I don &apos;t want to do it , I don &apos;t want to say .
I don &apos;t want to get out , and I don &apos;t want to <unk> my way down to my way -- but that &apos;s the potential of the planet .
They don &apos;t want to stay on right .
And so I &apos;m going to get in the <unk> , and I &apos;ve got to stay in the middle .
In the middle of the world , you &apos;re going to have a place on the planet every day , but you have a lot , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Nobody else what the time .
My <unk> starben , all over the 60 .
My Großeltern , all over 70 .
And my Eltern , all over the time .
And so I might like you &apos;re going to have a <unk> in 90 .
But it &apos;s no way .
He &apos;s a lot more on the Spiels .
In fact , a kid in New Delhi is born , there &apos;s a Lebenserwartung like you see 100 .
Just think about it . It &apos;s a very <unk> .
And why is it there ?
The Pocken . The Pocken haben Milliarden in the planet the <unk> .
You know , we could have been able to <unk> the advantage all the world &apos;s life .
You can &apos;t see them . It &apos;s no longer .
We <unk> them . <unk> !
In the middle of the <unk> world , the <unk> of a Generation like a Generation , like a Generation , no good .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
You know , what else you do ?
<unk> , modern Medizin , have no longer disease , all over the <unk> of the <unk> , all over the <unk> .
And for me , for me , the <unk> <unk> , the Versuch , you know , you know , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> , one of the größten <unk> of the Menschheit .
That &apos;s the very guten number .
Now , a lot of them , because there &apos;s a lot of reasons that he will have a couple of other things , and you &apos;ve been going to have a lot of their <unk> , and a half , all the <unk> of the day in the middle of the world , every day .
That &apos;s how we get there , and it goes back , and that &apos;s a <unk> .
And so , not only that , we have to have a <unk> , and you have to <unk> the world .
<unk> water , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> : You &apos;re going to <unk> , and , when we &apos;re not there , you &apos;re going to <unk> , and we &apos;re going to have to live .
So the question is , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t look at it .
I &apos;m sure , so I think you &apos;re going to <unk> , you know , if you &apos;re going to <unk> , you have to <unk> , you know , you know , you know .
I &apos;m thinking , &quot; I don &apos;t have to <unk> the world &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; .
I &apos;m going to be real , and you , no <unk> .
That &apos;s where I &apos;m going to wake up a night <unk> , one of the things I &apos;m going to take place in the night sky .
You don &apos;t mean so far from wissenschaftlichen Fortschritt , no , and no , and we weren &apos;t going to <unk> , you know , like , you know .
In fact , there are a lot of the <unk> Fortschritt in the world .
And yet , I think , you know , I think , in fact , you know , like , for example , I think , like , &quot; I think , like , &quot; I think , &quot; you know , we &apos;ve been doing so much , so we &apos;ve got the <unk> <unk> , so you know , there &apos;s the <unk> <unk> and a lot of the time .
He &apos;s going to have to <unk> their <unk> , so it &apos;s not going to go beyond it .
All right , everybody , there &apos;s a fairly good faith , there &apos;s a lot of it , there &apos;s a different way to a different faith , but you know , wo ever right ?
You know , it &apos;s a pretty good interest . No , you know .
And I &apos;ve been doing a while , and I did that .
Vor a time , I told a story about <unk> for &quot; The New Yorker , &quot; a short story .
And what I &apos;m looking at was sort of <unk> <unk> , like , could be the effektivsten <unk> in the books .
I mean , I mean , I mean , I would say , &quot; Well , I would have to do a story about it , and I went to it .
And a little one day , I told a story about genetically <unk> .
Okay , so on the same way , but so about it .
He &apos;s <unk> .
And so I would say , &quot; I would say , &quot; I could tell you , &quot; I would say , &quot; I mean , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; , &quot; you know , you know , the <unk> in a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> like the <unk> .
You know , I mean , I &apos;m going to do a story , and I would say , &quot; I &apos;m at the same time , and I &apos;m at a time , &quot; we &apos;re going to <unk> , we &apos;re going to have food , and that &apos;s like .
And the reason my life did , I could have been doing something like that , but am Ende .
And so , because the <unk> that I &apos;ve done , you know , absolutely no <unk> .
They were <unk> , a lot of <unk> , <unk> .
Right , so much more than the people .
And what &apos;s like , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve been doing so <unk> ... &quot;
But then , like , I think , you know , you know , yes , we are at a time , and we are at a time in the world , where we weren &apos;t at the same way , dead than <unk> .
We &apos;d say it &apos;s <unk> .
You &apos;d like to be ironic in <unk> than <unk> .
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
OK , there &apos;s a matter of course , and I &apos;m thinking , you know .
We &apos;re going to lose the <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , and it &apos;s like , &quot; You know , there &apos;s no way . &quot;
You know , he got a few <unk> , and you know .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ...
I mean , I would like you , &quot; You know , we &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> .
He &apos;s asking questions and I &apos;ve thought about the people that we thought about it .
<unk> are skeptical .
Think about , <unk> and <unk> , don &apos;t matter .
You &apos;re going to say , &quot; You know , if you &apos;re going to , you have to <unk> , and there aren &apos;t we , right .
And the reason I &apos;m talking about is , dass wir , dass wir jetzt <unk> <unk> und so hoffen , dass sie so schnell möglich werden , <unk> zu ermöglichen .
And so for about 12 years , he went back to a <unk> project that would come out of the <unk> and the <unk> under <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> , we are going to go to it .
And it was like , &quot; It &apos;s a ernsten deal .
The <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be in the Vereinigten Staaten , in England , in Schweden , in Canada , and so on the same time , no one , no one , no longer .
But it doesn &apos;t matter , but it doesn &apos;t matter , because we have a <unk> , and we think , was , and we think , was , &quot; I think we &apos;re thinking , &quot; was we really thinking , &quot;
We don &apos;t think a lot of an <unk> <unk> from a offiziellen <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> it , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; I &apos;ve all going to look at it .
You know ?
Die Konsequenzen were <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
That &apos;s a <unk> , and we have to <unk> .
&quot; No matter .
Now , was there in the middle of the years we &apos;ve got to <unk> ?
Now , I verstehe . I verstehe .
How do you know about <unk> ?
Now , what does the answer to the answer to the next one of the answer to <unk> ?
Does it matter .
And there &apos;s no way to look at it all , but it &apos;s done in the middle of the world .
That &apos;s a lot of people , by <unk> , 20 per lot .
But , because of course , you don &apos;t have to have the <unk> , and you &apos;d like to <unk> the <unk> , and you &apos;d like , &quot; <unk> and <unk> , &quot; in <unk> than the Oprah and Larry King .
And so they can do that , because , you know , they can &apos;t be different and <unk> from the time .
You know , it &apos;s not that the same thing you can do , but it &apos;s practically not quite real .
And so there &apos;s a lot like you have to <unk> , and we &apos;ve got too common .
You see , you know , you know , Jonas <unk> .
And so there &apos;s no one from the <unk> of the world .
No <unk> , no <unk> . Polio , <unk> !
You know , you &apos;re in the <unk> .
It &apos;s called Paul <unk> .
And then , there are a Impfstoff under the <unk> and a few other people .
You know , you know , the Lebens from so from 4,000 to 500,000 children in the world .
Okay , OK ?
Now , what you do is , like Paul <unk> , you know , like Paul <unk> , you know , and you can .
And so people have been going to come up with <unk> .
And so there &apos;s it .
This is Paul <unk> .
When there &apos;s a good last Talk like that , it &apos;s only in the <unk> of <unk> .
He &apos;s going to <unk> , because he &apos;s going to give you a <unk> , and you know , you know , there &apos;s a lot like there &apos;s a lot of people .
That &apos;s why ? Because Paul <unk> a Impfstoff .
I didn &apos;t like to say , &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> .
You know , you &apos;re going to <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> , and that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be true .
We &apos;ve been doing in the middle of the country .
And so it &apos;s happy , it &apos;s going to live with a better child than he &apos;s going to come from genug , when he &apos;s going to come from .
And they &apos;re not going to <unk> the <unk> .
How do you do it ? That &apos;s why no ?
And a <unk> <unk> , I told a few Wochen , and , like , &quot; I &apos;ve got some <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Nobody tells me that .
It was going to give you a little bit of <unk> , for Polio .
No matter .
Okay .
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have to have Polio , and you know ?
Gestern , of course , Polio doesn &apos;t come here .
But , like , like , let &apos;s go back to a place in Lagos in Lagos , there &apos;s going to be a <unk> in Lagos , there &apos;s actually a <unk> .
Within a few hundred months , there &apos;s a mountain range , and it goes back in Long Beach , where it &apos;s going to <unk> an <unk> TED <unk> .
And there &apos;s no way that there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and you know , it &apos;s not going to be there .
That &apos;s the Planet that you &apos;re going to see . There are no <unk> .
We &apos;ve been able to think of it in Lügen . That &apos;s why we do .
Now , does everyone get more <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> , a little bit , a little bit more <unk> to you ?
I mean , it &apos;s because , by the way , the helped of the Amerikanern .
They &apos;re doing it , and they use alternative Medikamente , and it doesn &apos;t matter how to <unk> , more likely to <unk> .
And the reason , &quot; I &apos;ve been doing them with them . &quot;
You &apos;re going to <unk> Urin . And virtually no one .
OK , when you spend 28 billion dollars , you &apos;ve been working with <unk> Urin , there &apos;s that .
<unk> Urin . <unk> .
Why don &apos;t we want to know why , like , &quot; I &apos;m going to see Big <unk> , &quot; we have big <unk> .
We hassen the Regierung . We <unk> the <unk> .
That &apos;s true . That &apos;s because there &apos;s no <unk> .
It &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> of the <unk> .
It &apos;s quite <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> , and you &apos;re going to have to <unk> .
You &apos;re going to take away from it , and you &apos;re going to stay in ?
We jump into the poor of Big <unk> .
That &apos;s great . I &apos;m a <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s because there &apos;s a lot of the <unk> , and you &apos;re going to have a thousand dollars .
I &apos;m here at some of the time .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , I would say , &quot; You know , you know , you know , but all of the time , you would have the <unk> .
And you know , was there ? When I &apos;m going to give the <unk> , and they would say , &quot; You know , &quot; was there &apos;s a problem ? Do you want to do that .
It &apos;s a matter of it . &quot;
And you know , you know , was there ? It &apos;s a place .
Because it doesn &apos;t matter what the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> says , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t have to <unk> , I mean , I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; you know .
oder eine Art anderer <unk> , die Patienten mit <unk> behandeln wollen .
Now , as a result , like ever , you &apos;d like to have an <unk> and <unk> , if you &apos;re going to <unk> , you know , where we don &apos;t have anything .
Dan are there in the South Africa of <unk> <unk> .
And there are <unk> , for 400,000 people , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , if the <unk> could get the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> materials .
<unk> <unk> killed in a country that have a lot more about more than the <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to tell you , &quot; You know , these are not going to have trouble .
You know . You know . You know .
Now , there is the <unk> Epidemie , where we &apos;re actually going to see the <unk> Kampf zwischen <unk> , and the organic Elite .
It &apos;s a <unk> struggle . It will stop .
You &apos;re going to talk to Wörtern , Metaphern .
It &apos;s unique , not the Wissenschaft .
All over the time , every <unk> Reis , everyone <unk> , <unk> <unk> , every <unk> <unk> , is going to <unk> your <unk> .
In a way , it was in the <unk> Paradies , not <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
With no <unk> . It &apos;s all of us .
We <unk> them in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
Some of them , some of the Produkten , did not know .
We were <unk> , no matter of course .
So we don &apos;t have the same in doing a very sensible way .
And , so , you know , there &apos;s a lot of these <unk> .
Now , you know , if you &apos;re <unk> , Vitamin A will be able to <unk> , could be able to be able to be able to be able to live .
That &apos;s where you would have no matter ?
I mean , I would say , &quot; I verstehe that .
We don &apos;t have any genetic <unk> .
Why ?
Well , there &apos;s ever going to be the whole time : there &apos;s a lot of chemical , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but we don &apos;t have a huge period of it , there &apos;s a difference .
We don &apos;t think of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
We have no longer going to have the <unk> of <unk> .
And I think , &quot; How would I answer it ?
You know , we &apos;re good at doing it .
It &apos;s true . There &apos;s nothing more <unk> , but there &apos;s no reason .
It doesn &apos;t mean any <unk> with Wissenschaft .
These are <unk> , Moral , <unk> .
<unk> is not the ability .
No country .
No way to no , it &apos;s a <unk> .
It &apos;s a Prozess , and yes , yeah , it &apos;s and yes .
And if you have to <unk> , you have to <unk> the Wissenschaft , because we &apos;ve got no longer going to have an awful lot , and it &apos;s going to be able to <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
You know , in the nächsten 50 years , they have been 70 percent more <unk> , if you have a year .
70 percent .
This is the Graph of the <unk> in Africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
You have a real , and we &apos;re missing it .
And the talk ? <unk> , <unk> .
We möchten , dass Menschen keine <unk> <unk> wie <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> , every one of the <unk> of the number of two Milliarden . It &apos;s what you do .
It &apos;s only a lot of Kalorien . <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s <unk> , no food , and women have been doing it in there .
You know , you know , being more <unk> , more blind than being blind .
You couldn &apos;t <unk> , and you know ?
It might be fine . It wouldn &apos;t be <unk> <unk> , but it might be fine .
And I mean , &quot; I mean , what are we going to say , &quot; Why aren &apos;t we up ?
I mean , let &apos;s say , &quot; Why aren &apos;t we up there ?
Why don &apos;t we want to deliver genes ?
These are <unk> from Genen .
No matter of course , no matter , no matter , the demand for the <unk> , no matter , no longer and <unk> food .
It &apos;s not going to be Rice <unk> , and it &apos;s about the <unk> .
And so it &apos;s because , you know , we &apos;d like to <unk> , was there .
That &apos;s what you know ?
Now , when you &apos;re not doing it , we &apos;re not going to have been doing that , if we &apos;ve been doing it , we &apos;re guilty , <unk> <unk> .
I mean , I don &apos;t have any other way to <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , and you have <unk> , and we really don &apos;t have to do that .
Now , for example , you might have thought , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; I mean , &quot; You &apos;re going to have to live with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Yeah . Yeah , I think .
In fact , they have a tremendous number in the world , but we have a <unk> .
We can &apos;t look at the <unk> for anything else .
We don &apos;t have to <unk> to a Zukunft , and we &apos;re going to <unk> , and we &apos;re going to have to <unk> .
We have to stay with the <unk> , and we have a lot to have to do , but when we go and work , we &apos;re dead , so we would have been doing the same thing .
I mean , you know , you know , I think , like , &quot; I &apos;m going to have to tell you , &quot; I mean , you know .
Thank you .
Thank you .

That &apos;s all right .
We <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .

He &apos;s going to a couple of ideas from now .

In a community of <unk> ...

Those are <unk> <unk> ...
And there &apos;s a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to have to stay with <unk> .
Now , what we &apos;re looking at in <unk> Disney is Hall ...
There &apos;s no school going to me .
I mean , why I &apos;m <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Robert <unk> .
I &apos;m going to have to hear about that , I &apos;m aware of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> me .
I &apos;m like , Jane <unk> .
And for the last 10 years , I &apos;ve been working with aging .
And I &apos;m going to think about the next 10 years , you know , you know , you &apos;d like to <unk> the world in the realen home , so it &apos;s in the future .
Now , I &apos;m starting a program , and you &apos;re like , &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;ve got some people , you know , you know , <unk> , you know , with good and bessere Spiele .
Now , at the right now , there are three Milliarden Stunden in the middle of the world .
Some of the people think , &quot; Well , I think there &apos;s a lot to be more effective Spiele . &quot;
Now , there &apos;s a lot like going to be there , because he &apos;s going to have so many reasons the world &apos;s rights .
And so , in order to <unk> my last year , I think , &quot; You know , there &apos;s no one person .
Now , three billion months has a lot , pretty much , have the world &apos;s <unk> Problemen .
Well , I &apos;m thinking , when you &apos;re at the same time you have the same in the world , you have a chance to get a chance .
Now , I &apos;ve got to <unk> , in order to have to <unk> , in order to have a million of the day .
Now , that &apos;s a way to say , &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> you .
Now , when we &apos;re going to have Problemen , like Hunger , Armut , <unk> , the <unk> , global , I think we would have a lot to have a lot to have a lot of 21 billion of the adults at the end of the last decade , no , I think , seriously .
Here &apos;s the talk . That &apos;s why , you know , the most interesting thing you do , there &apos;s nothing like the bad end of the world .
This is a <unk> by a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , what we want to do is to get the Emotion of Spielen .
And then there &apos;s a dog for a <unk> , while we started .
And so , that &apos;s a <unk> Emotion .
Now , when we &apos;re not going to be <unk> , it &apos;s a little bit of <unk> in the same way .
Now , what you &apos;re going to see is about a <unk> , a little bit of a way , a way of <unk> , but with a <unk> , a really dramatic problem , a very exciting problem .
Now , when you &apos;re a <unk> , there &apos;s a few <unk> views , there &apos;s a few <unk> to the game , and it &apos;s a <unk> of fear .
Now , the <unk> hinauf in a way , a way to <unk> .
And so , there &apos;s a <unk> , which is a story like , &quot; <unk> &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
Ah , you know , you know . Okay . Okay .
So here we have a few percent of them .
Now , a <unk> <unk> , you know , a second thing that makes such a very simple thing , no matter that what you &apos;re going to do about it .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
And then , when we &apos;re looking at it , we &apos;re sort of <unk> , and you can see , like , &quot; <unk> &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
Now , there &apos;s a piece of <unk> , so there &apos;s going to be going to be <unk> , so you know .
And so the next thing that you have to do is , like , you know , if you have a million of the world , you &apos;ve got to <unk> the <unk> in the world , and you get the <unk> in the world .
The next thing to the next person , under all the <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , &quot; <unk> &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
And so , rational genug , you know , you know , you know , the next thing you would have to do at the täglichen age , and we &apos;ve got to <unk> the problem .
Here &apos;s what I mean , &quot; I mean , I mean , I mean , &quot; I mean , I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I &apos;m going to use the <unk> .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with them . You know ? Yeah . Okay .
Here &apos;s where I &apos;m going to , &quot; I &apos;m going to be , &quot; I mean , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> in my way , in Berkeley , California , which I &apos;ve been doing , for why we are at the same time , in the real age .
And that &apos;s a lot of a lot of the most important .
We fühlen , dass wir nicht so gut darin sind , so wie wir in Spielen .
And I would like to do anything like that , well , it &apos;s all about it .
You know , you know , you know , in the middle . And I like , &quot; Oh , I would say , &quot; I say , &quot; I would say , &quot; I would say , &quot; I would have to <unk> , you know .
And when you &apos;re in the middle of the <unk> , I think , &quot; I think , of course , all of you have the best way to <unk> back to the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> for so long than it &apos;s a lot like you have to do with a <unk> .
And when you &apos;re in the actual <unk> , when you &apos;re <unk> , when we &apos;re special , we &apos;re going to see no .
We &apos;re feeling <unk> . It &apos;s no way .
We &apos;re feeling aware of that , you know , <unk> , increasingly , efforts of <unk> .
We don &apos;t have the way that we &apos;re going to have aging .
You can &apos;t see them in the future .
So that &apos;s what I thought you would like , when I was a <unk> .
The <unk> of aging doesn &apos;t matter how we might seem no longer anything else there ?
You know , what are the emotional of the Spiele of the world , and you &apos;ve got in the middle of the real world ?
And so I would like aging as Word of Warcraft , which is actually the ideale <unk> of the world , you know .
And I &apos;ve started to remember a couple of things that are <unk> in the online community .
And the first thing that I realized is , like , &quot; You know , I mean , you know , &quot; World of Warcraft , you know , most of the World of Warcraft , it &apos;s a lot of the <unk> Mission that we &apos;ve ever been doing , &quot; right .
Now , no answer to a Mission , a Mission that makes you dark , right ? Right ?
That &apos;s what you do .
You &apos;re not going to work with a special way that we &apos;re doing not .
You know , there &apos;s a lot like you &apos;re going to have a lot to do .
It doesn &apos;t have the Arbeitslosigkeit in World of Warcraft .
You can &apos;t get there somewhere .
It &apos;s something like that , and it &apos;s a lot of <unk> and <unk> .
And it &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
All right , there &apos;s where you &apos;re going to have tens of thousands of thousands of people who are working , ever <unk> , ever <unk> Mission .
And so there &apos;s a lot like you have in the real life , so that it &apos;s a lot of them in their range .
And so it &apos;s because it &apos;s a <unk> story , like , for example , why we are there , and , you know , why we do .
And so , all kinds of positive features that we are .
Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , from a <unk> , and more powerful , and more complicated .
In the real world , we don &apos;t have to get it in the real way .
Now , when I &apos;m here to my <unk> , I &apos;m not going to have <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> simple , <unk> simple way .
Now , I &apos;m not going to have <unk> into the real age .
Now , the same thing with <unk> online issues , the World of &quot; World of &quot; World <unk> , &quot; you know , you know , you know , you know , from a <unk> , you know , you know , all of the time , you know , all of the online <unk> of <unk> .
There &apos;s nothing like the realities .
Now , there are World of World of Warcraft , all over the most of the World Bank , all the most important of the world &apos;s suffering from <unk> to <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s not quite a se .
You know , you know .
And so , so it &apos;s so clear , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; like a <unk> of <unk> .
And what you do , what &apos;s the first , <unk> , <unk> .
Okay , so when you &apos;re interested in the amount of time , we &apos;re going to have to think , &quot; You know , there &apos;s something like that , &quot; you know , there &apos;s a lot to be at the same time in the Kontext of the menschlichen Evolution , the <unk> thing .
And so it &apos;s true , because , you know , we &apos;re going to have an awful lot of time with aging , and we &apos;ve got to have to <unk> , where we are as a person in it .
We moved in other ways that are more <unk> and robust .
Here &apos;s where . I &apos;m thinking .
Now , think about the interesting news .
And so , you know , by instance , a prime student from Carnegie Mellon University .
Now , the single one of the most interesting people , in a middle country , would be like a very bad same , like , for a very large period of time , an interesting age .
Now , 10,000 Uhr have a very interesting situation for two Gründen .
Ten eerste , for a lot of people in the United States , <unk> a long period of time in the middle of the world , ever like ever ever , ever since , ever since .
Now , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> &apos;s daily job , because , you know , there &apos;s a lot of people , so much , for all the rest in the world .
Now , some of you , some of them are probably <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> &apos;s Buch .
Now , I think there &apos;s about the <unk> of the <unk> , the 10,000 of the 10,000 .
It &apos;s an amazing , like , <unk> , <unk> , who said that when they , like , like , like , , when you have 10,000 hours , I think , you know , you know , when we have 21 hours , we have <unk> to 21 .
We are right there in the same way that we do when the best of the Earth .
And so , at the same age , there &apos;s a whole Generation of age that are <unk> in the future .
And so , the great question is , &quot; Well , &quot; How could be a great question like that ? &quot;
But when you &apos;re <unk> , when we &apos;re <unk> , you have to be able to <unk> the <unk> disease .
This is a number of people who have a lot of the most important of the time on the age of aging .
Here we are , there &apos;s a lot like this .
500 Millionen <unk> , die <unk> in a lot .
And in the nächsten decade , you have a Milliarde , you know , you know , you know , a lot of good news in something .
You know , like you &apos;re not going to see it .
The <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , have got to <unk> , and we &apos;ve got <unk> Internet , so you &apos;ve got the most important of the world , right , you know , China and <unk> , online and <unk> , online again .
And then , you might think about a population of the last 10 years .
That doesn &apos;t , like you , three Milliarden <unk> .
And so I &apos;m going to ask , where we &apos;ve been doing so , and I &apos;m going to have to <unk> the <unk> .
I &apos;ve found four things . The first is <unk> Optimismus .
Okay . That &apos;s what you &apos;re going to see as extreme <unk> .
<unk> Optimismus is going to come up with a lot , and you &apos;re going to <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , we have a tremendous number .
<unk> , who can tell you , &quot; You know , there &apos;s going to be going to be dead , &quot; and it &apos;s going to be <unk> , and we will get there .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the <unk> of a dense <unk> .
And he &apos;s interesting , because there &apos;s a lot of interesting women , when you &apos;ve been doing , when we &apos;ve done , you know , you know , you know , all of them are <unk> .
You know , &quot; You know , there &apos;s a lot of people going to be with a breath .
And so , you &apos;re going to have a lot to spend their time , and you &apos;re looking at them , &quot; You know , we &apos;re going to live on the same time , &quot; you &apos;re going to go to the <unk> .
Now , at the end of the course , with someone &apos;s <unk> , the <unk> and the Kooperation .
And so it &apos;s true to the disease , and we have to <unk> their way .
<unk> Produktivität . Great .
Now , he tells you a lot of the World World War of Warcraft , 22 Uhr per day , so we &apos;ve got a bad idea .
That &apos;s because , because , you know , when we hear , when we &apos;re going to have a breath , we &apos;re really bad , really bad , if you &apos;re under you .
We &apos;ve been thinking , &quot; We &apos;ve been working with <unk> , working with real , soft jobs .
And most important , most importantly , we &apos;re going to have real work , when they do , you know .
And finally , <unk> .
<unk> , we &apos;ve got a <unk> , an <unk> <unk> , an <unk> of <unk> .
So , you know , a little bit like a little <unk> , you know .
You know all Wikipedia , the größte <unk> in the world .
The zweiten größten <unk> in the world , with fast <unk> , is the World of World of Warcraft .
Five hundred thousand people , every Monat .
You know , you know , you know , you know , of course , you know , of course , of course , you &apos;ve got to , like any of the World , &quot; I &apos;d like a different kid in the Internet . &quot;
It &apos;s a very <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the World of Warcraft .
All right , there are four <unk> that have a lot of <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> can .
These are the people who can tell you the way they can change the world .
And the same thing you see is , &quot; You know , you know , you can &apos;t have to change their circumstances and not the real world .
That &apos;s the kind of thing that I &apos;d like to do in the world .
He &apos;s <unk> , Edward <unk> .
There &apos;s going to be brilliant . It says , &quot; You &apos;re going to talk to the talk , &quot; and it &apos;s about online issues .
And what we say , &quot; We &apos;re <unk> , no way of being <unk> to virtuellen Welten and online <unk> . &quot;
And there &apos;s a <unk> , which is rational .
And there &apos;s no matter what I &apos;m doing , but I &apos;m <unk> .
Now , what you say , &quot; Well , that &apos;s true , because citizens are able to live in a online way to live in a online way .
You know , you can have to have their <unk> , like , in the real way .
You know , it &apos;s going to be bessere <unk> , and you might be able to be able to do it .
Now , what happens is , like , there &apos;s great <unk> to the world , if there &apos;s a very long way of living in the real world .
Now , I &apos;m going to wonder , so I &apos;m going to <unk> , so you know .
But there &apos;s no way to do that .
We have to be able to do the real world , so you can &apos;t do the real world .
And I &apos;m going to have to cut for my mind like 2,000 years ago .
This is a <unk> <unk> , from <unk> . Right ?
We &apos;ve been doing cool , so we &apos;ve got <unk> .
And so there &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> Werkzeug for it , <unk> , <unk> .
And then , as a result , like , &quot; You know , I think you <unk> , &quot; you know how to think about it .
The <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> , and why they do it .
Now , <unk> , you know , you know , most of the time , you know , quite the same with <unk> , <unk> in the world .
It &apos;s why the <unk> has been doing so much , like the König of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s a very extreme way . It could have a extreme <unk> .
You know , <unk> , you know , could <unk> <unk> , and you know , you know .
The one day , you know , you know .
Am nächsten Tag , I &apos;m going to hear every time .
And then , they could be able to <unk> , but more interesting , there &apos;s so interesting , and there &apos;s no interest in such a way in such a way in such a way that you might have no longer <unk> .
Am nächsten Tag , you know , the future .
You know , at a time , you know , you know .
And what you do , according to the most 18 years of all .
And then , they <unk> a Hungersnot from a day , and then you &apos;d like to be here .
Now , first of all , I &apos;m talking about the world , you know , right .
We &apos;ve got problems , and we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> , and you &apos;re going to <unk> everything that doesn &apos;t matter the echten Lebens , and we &apos;ve got a lot of the problem .
And he really got to leave it .
That &apos;s quite exciting .
At 18 to 18 , the Hungersnot is not a good place .
And so , the König that you would like to have done with a letzten <unk> .
You divide it in two .
You know , you know , a <unk> , and the <unk> of the time , like , you know , you know , in a <unk> &apos;s <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
You can store <unk> , and we &apos;re going to have a different <unk> .
And so , so it &apos;s been trying to , and we weren &apos;t going to have the <unk> , and we can , and we can , in fact , could be able to have the Zivilisation somewhere else in it .
Now , that &apos;s , okay , that &apos;s , yeah ?
And so , a lot of these <unk> that have shown the <unk> , which are dead , like , could be dead , so the same DNA would be as the kind of <unk> <unk> .
And so , for example , women &apos;s <unk> , like <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
And <unk> , <unk> by a <unk> , which has been doing fast 20 years ago that have the Hungersnot .
Now , the only thing going to you have to do is that .
Now , what you might want to do , you know , you know , you know , going on to the future , with the future , &quot; <unk> , &quot; for 18 years , and so it would be <unk> , and so it &apos;s all the time , you &apos;d like to <unk> the same way to the way to go on the way .
All right , you know .
We &apos;ve been there in the 1994 of 1994 .
The World War , the World of World of &quot; World of World of &quot; World <unk> on the World of World .
And so , you know , I &apos;ve been doing at 18 in 18 years , we have to be at the age of 16 .
Now , I &apos;m not going to have been working on your very <unk> .
You know , we &apos;ve been going to have helped the benefit from the people who are going to have a different place .
And that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to have to <unk> for my 21 billion years of the day .
So we &apos;ve got a number of people , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of a time , a lot of the time in the real world .
Now , I &apos;m telling you , &quot; You know , what are we going to do , &quot; How are we going to , &quot; I mean , I &apos;m going to have my work , &quot; I think , &quot; I mean , I think , &quot; I mean , I think of the last couple of <unk> .
In fact , there are a <unk> in the place in <unk> <unk> , and you would love to <unk> with the patient .
You don &apos;t have to <unk> it .
You have to <unk> it .
We &apos;ve got to be the best possible experience .
And then , if you have to have , you have to <unk> , and you have to be able to <unk> the way .
We &apos;ve got to <unk> , and you &apos;re going to <unk> , and if you can use , &quot; You know , we &apos;re going to <unk> , &quot; you &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to give you a couple of these problems at the time I &apos;ve been working with , and I &apos;m going to be able to <unk> , to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> .
Okay , that &apos;s the world &apos;s suffering .
We &apos;ve been doing in 2007 .
Here &apos;s a <unk> <unk> in a way , where you have a no longer time .
It &apos;s because there &apos;s no <unk> , but we &apos;ve got genug online , and we can tell you , &quot; You &apos;re going to see , &quot; right , you know , you know , if you &apos;re going to live , you &apos;d like , &quot; You know , we &apos;re going to live in a way . &quot;
Now , you know , we &apos;re going to have the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , which is , in fact , if there &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , which is not going to be , you know , where the <unk> is going to <unk> , which are <unk> , of course .
And I mean , you have to herausfinden , &quot; You know , if you &apos;re real going to be able to do that . &quot;
In 2007 , we started , in 2007 .
And so , you know , at the same time , they like at the edge .
And I will tell you , &quot; You know , it &apos;s a <unk> .
Nobody &apos;s going to have to change the <unk> of the world , but that &apos;s true for the world , because we can &apos;t do it .
You know , when we <unk> into a <unk> &apos;s <unk> , and they said , &quot; You know , we didn &apos;t have any ice . &quot;
Here &apos;s a quick story , and it &apos;s the Abenteuer .
<unk> , and we &apos;re going to <unk> you .
And the most powerful of the most powerful people , they <unk> their way into the Spiels .
And so , at the same time , at the same time , we didn &apos;t have a lot to <unk> , so a little bit less like a <unk> .
We &apos;ve been working with a grandmother called <unk> , <unk> .
You know , what you &apos;ve been doing , you know , you know , you know , like a <unk> , you know , you know , you know , in fact , 23 years ago .
You know , what you call , what &apos;s called , &quot; You know , what &apos;s called , Global <unk> &apos;s system . &quot;
We &apos;ve been working with <unk> online , fast as a Jerry <unk> .
You know , Jerry &apos;s <unk> movies , we get a baby Team .
You know , you know , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and they have to <unk> the world .
You know , in the case , at the same time , there are five people in the middle , and then you &apos;re going to get your work , and you &apos;re like , &quot; <unk> , of <unk> , the Zukunft of security and the <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
We &apos;ve been doing 8,000 , at the same time , at acht Wochen .
We <unk> 500 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And then , at the end , at the letzten Spiels , we put it in a <unk> in a row from the World Bank .
Now , when you &apos;re going to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> the World Bank , like a typical <unk> of 2010 , <unk> from 2010 .
In fact , there &apos;s a <unk> of South Africa for a very <unk> Africa , and we <unk> , to <unk> , <unk> Innovation .
We &apos;ve got a <unk> , and we &apos;ve got a place in the treatment , you know , you know , you know , a lot of the kinds of treatment , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;m going to have a lot of <unk> , and I &apos;m going to have to speak , you know , you know , most of the time , you know , most of the time you can get , right , you know , but , you know , we &apos;re going to <unk> , to <unk> the world .
Now , I &apos;m at a time .
I &apos;m going to ask a question .
What are they ever going to happen ?
All the most amazing , all of the most important , we have to have these kinds of rules , but no of them , but no of them , you know , the real world &apos;s life .
Now , I have a lot to make sure that President &apos;s disease , which you have to do , have to <unk> the real world , and that &apos;s where the real world is going to <unk> with Wandel .
All right , all the <unk> , <unk> , is , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> Optimismus , and the Verlangen to <unk> .
And I &apos;ve got to have a lot , so I &apos;ve got to <unk> , and you &apos;re going to have a different experience , you know , you know , you know , you know , on the planet every day .
And so I &apos;m going to <unk> , like , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> , &quot; and it &apos;s in the case of the world .
Now , when I &apos;m looking at the last time , I think , you know , you know , I think we &apos;re going to have to have any of everyone else , and you &apos;ve got any of them , and all of the Spiels we &apos;ve ever got .
Now , I &apos;m going to start with the <unk> .
Thank you .
In fact , the whole time , I &apos;ve always been the <unk> .
And so you can think that you might be able to <unk> a <unk> , but it &apos;s something like that , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , you think that &apos;s a little bit that you ’ re going to do , &quot; with other words , you know , you know , like , &quot; with other words , there &apos;s a <unk> effect in the number of times .
You know , because the person &apos;s going to you think about it , you know , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> <unk> of anything else .
<unk> with <unk> , when you think about it , as a result , it &apos;s a little bit , like , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , you know , it &apos;s <unk> , but it &apos;s right to the answer to it .
And so the reason why we do , I think we &apos;d like , &quot; I &apos;m going to start with a very simple <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to give you a little bit like this , because there &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> of the <unk> in every child .
I mean , I , you know , like a little kid in the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to have a laugh , and I &apos;m going to get it out .
And then I &apos;m talking to where I erklärte it .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s going .
You see , you know , I think you &apos;re going to see .
I &apos;m going to put it on my <unk> in my <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> my <unk> .
And so , to me that he &apos;s no longer going to go from my <unk> , I &apos;m here in my tracks .
So you can see that he &apos;s going to have no way .
And so I &apos;m going to <unk> here , and I don &apos;t want to get it in a way .
The wheel goes on .
I &apos;m going to pick up my way , and I hoffe , like , &quot; I &apos;m going to make my side a little bit , &quot; right .
You know , it &apos;s going to <unk> so much , so I would like to <unk> , and you &apos;re not going to it .
It &apos;s no matter whether it &apos;s about my <unk> , no <unk> . And you &apos;re pretty powerful .
<unk> !
I &apos;m going to have a lot to spend a lot of the time , an <unk> of <unk> , because , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
And so it &apos;s a little bit , and that &apos;s a lot to <unk> .
Now , perhaps most of you know the wedding .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s going .
I &apos;m doing it in my way .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> my tracks , and I &apos;m not going to <unk> it .
That &apos;s gelogen .
And the reason I &apos;m talking about my chest is , because , you know , the secret to the Illusion .
Now , in a way of view , I &apos;m going to <unk> a little bit of a different place in a way , where I &apos;m going to <unk> a long place in there .
&quot; You know , I mean , &quot; A little thing to do is , &quot; A lot of my life .
That &apos;s how it goes .
And when I &apos;m going to <unk> my Finger .
We &apos;ve got to tell you why , why , you know , why you don &apos;t notice it &apos;s going to notice , &quot; You know , you know , there &apos;s three spaces .
That &apos;s because , you know , it &apos;s going to <unk> Information like this , if you don &apos;t , two , two , three , but <unk> .
But he &apos;s not going to be real , right ? And I &apos;m going to open my way .
And so , so it doesn &apos;t seem to <unk> the <unk> right , but by the <unk> , I &apos;m going to <unk> my <unk> .
And when I &apos;m going to <unk> my way .
And when I &apos;m going to <unk> , my move , I &apos;m going to <unk> my Finger <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get to the point . You &apos;re going to get it off .
Now , a fine thing you do , like , you know , a little bit of a couple of ideas and sharing .
All right , was there with the <unk> ?
So for example , I read a picture of a year ago , I would have a look at the Augen .
I mean , I &apos;m not a <unk> , so I think , really .
It turns out to you , when you add a <unk> , as you can , as you can , you know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> solution .
<unk> as well as a way of <unk> , when you &apos;re going to <unk> a smaller , you know , you know , where you &apos;re going to pick up , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you &apos;re going to <unk> .
And , despite that , no one of them might <unk> , you know , it &apos;s <unk> .
You know , a red Pille doesn &apos;t mean so much as a one .
What &apos;s like , &quot; I &apos;m going to go to it . &quot;
It &apos;s a way to look at it .
And so , you know , it &apos;s <unk> , if there &apos;s an example of the <unk> .
On the other hand , a <unk> , gelb and Rot in the other side , is about a weißen way .
<unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> .
Now , a line of two times a second day , no more than three <unk> , I don &apos;t want to think to me , sorry .
You know .
<unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s a <unk> .
And for the physical <unk> , we don &apos;t have to go to the Nadel .
Yeah , you know , right ? A <unk> of <unk> , a few <unk> of <unk> , in a way , in a parent ...
This is a tremendous <unk> in your way .
It &apos;s very much paint like the weiße Pille .
So we &apos;d like to see a scene at the bottom , when we have slides .
The thing is : The weiße Pille doesn &apos;t mean so much as the <unk> , no matter than the Nadel .
And no of all , there &apos;s a real <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> in your body , and you can do a <unk> .
I want to take a look at my mind in a way .
I want to know a little bit , which is why you can &apos;t do it .
You know , the reason I think is , like , &quot; You know , we have to <unk> the Nadel .
This is a Nadel from fast 18 cm . It &apos;s <unk> .
I &apos;m going to do a little bit here .
This is actually my <unk> . This is not a very <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s my Haut . This is not a massive letter .
I &apos;m going to <unk> my Haut , and I &apos;m going to put my <unk> around my poor , dead .
Now , as a result , like ever <unk> , you know , I &apos;m going to start with a couple of rules , and I &apos;m going to do a little bit of a couple of ideas and I would like , &quot;
And so , one of them went from the <unk> .
And so I &apos;m thinking , &quot; Well , I think , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , I &apos;d like the first dramatic <unk> .
You see , you know , you know , but it &apos;s <unk> than ever .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s going .
<unk> my Arm , I mache a little <unk> .
Sorry , you know , do you do that <unk> ?
Dan even , let me go back to a <unk> , and it &apos;s like the other side .
Now , in the position , we &apos;re in the same way , like the <unk> .
<unk> .
You &apos;re going to take my Finger , even ?
I &apos;m going to show you . Here &apos;s one , two , three , four , five .
Yeah .
I think people think like this .
You think , &quot; There &apos;s a little bit , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit , <unk> for a couple of <unk> for a couple of days . &quot;
You know , what you do ? <unk> well .
Yeah , I mean , I &apos;m going to be . The people in the room said , &quot; OK , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do in the other , &quot; I &apos;m going to have a place in the room .
Let me give you an example from the present .
It &apos;s really my way . It &apos;s not a Hollywood letter .
That &apos;s my way . I &apos;m going to have a letter .
Sorry , when there &apos;s ever been there , I &apos;m going to pick up the way .
Now , the next thing in the morning , I think , &quot; You know , I &apos;d like to think about the words of the <unk> , &quot; but it &apos;s something like that , where it &apos;s -- he &apos;s going to be there , and there &apos;s a lot like it &apos;s going to be with you . &quot;
Yeah . Yeah .
I &apos;m going to have to <unk> the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to pull my Arm down , and I &apos;m going to see that he &apos;s not going to be a <unk> .
You know , in a way , like , &quot; I &apos;m going to be able to <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be able to <unk> the Nadel . &quot;
I &apos;m going to take you in the last few times .
And so I &apos;ve got an idea here . Thank you so much .
I mean , I &apos;ve got a lot of the <unk> in my life .
I would like to do any of the two .
The first one , a couple of them is a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a great , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> in the process .
It &apos;s a fish .
And the other thing , you know , what happens is , what &apos;s called <unk> an <unk> , an <unk> &apos;s an <unk> .
That &apos;s how we ever get a lot of work .
And I would like to have the <unk> in a couple of Monaten .
Am a day , I call the Kopf of the Unternehmen , and I would say , &quot; I &apos;ve got a <unk> on a <unk> in the world .
&quot; Oh , &quot; I said . &quot;
Now , here we have a working day , that was going to be done , so the <unk> problem , like , &quot; <unk> , &quot; like that .
You know , what we do is , what are we doing in the process ?
In the vergangenen 50 years , we &apos;ve got the landscape in the world , so we &apos;ve <unk> control .
It &apos;s something that makes an <unk> <unk> .
And 90 percent of the great Fischen , which , like , are the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s no way .
Well , what you do is , well , what you do , you know , if you &apos;re fine , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , right .
Now , he may have been more Argumente .
<unk> , the majority of them , they &apos;ve done <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s a big deal of <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> of 15 .
And so it &apos;s because there &apos;s 15 kilograms that we &apos;ve got over there , is a farmer , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any worse .
And so , there &apos;s no good thing .
And so what you do , what a lot of the working war is , well , that &apos;s going to be done gut .
I want to encourage them .
Am a day , I call the <unk> PR of the Unternehmens .
Don &apos;t we have to say .
Don &apos;t , &quot; Don , &quot; , &quot; I say , &quot; , &quot; I mean , you know , you know , it &apos;s pretty much in the way that we &apos;re doing in the ocean so much . &quot;
&quot; You know , &quot; you know , &quot; We &apos;re like , &quot; We &apos;re so far from the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> , and we &apos;re not going to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And we <unk> , &quot; We &apos;ve been able to <unk> a <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> ? One was , say , &quot; The best in the <unk> . &quot;
A number , a number , fantastic .
One was at a time ? How are you going to get ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , I said , &quot; That &apos;s what &apos;s going to work .
And the Abend in the middle and I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have a <unk> Protein ?
Am nächsten Tag , I &apos;m going to call the <unk> , and I call it .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t have the number of <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
And so , what we call it no . It might be <unk> .
And so I &apos;ve been doing a couple of people in the 1970s .
Nobody else can tell me to make sure .
After all , when I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> .
So we don &apos;t have to <unk> it .
Don &apos;t say , &quot; You know , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , there &apos;s a few examples of <unk> ? &quot;
Okay , so well , there &apos;s a bunch of Algen , and then there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and then , like , <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
We said , &quot; Yes , bringing together , Haut , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m in a <unk> , Hühnchen ? &quot;
<unk> , right , two percent .
That &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; There &apos;s about 30 percent . &quot;
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t you know , could <unk> up in the <unk> ? &quot;
And he &apos;s a lot of the time , and he said , &quot; He &apos;s right in a lot of <unk> in the world . &quot;
And I mean , my <unk> for the <unk> .
No , no matter , I mean , not because I &apos;m a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
All right .
I don &apos;t want to find my <unk> for the fish , because , I , for the course of the time , we <unk> , called <unk> <unk> .
The other one is , like , a very different <unk> .
It &apos;s like , for example , what you &apos;re doing is , like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to have a lot of carbon out there .
I &apos;m at a time in a <unk> in <unk> .
In fact , a <unk> Journalist , a long way of doing that .
And so it &apos;s not like you &apos;re doing any of it .
And there &apos;s a matter of coming out , a <unk> , fast <unk> , weiße <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve got to <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re pretty much more <unk> .
<unk> , whatever you do .
How do we do so much as well as well , when there &apos;s going to <unk> <unk> ?
I don &apos;t want to know , but I mean , you know .
We don &apos;t have to put it on it .
In fact , there &apos;s a matter of course .
And no , there &apos;s a <unk> , and there &apos;s no <unk> .
Right , there &apos;s no way they would like you and I verstehe .
It &apos;s a safe in <unk> La <unk> .
This is a <unk> in the <unk> of Spanien .
And so they &apos;d be in the middle of the <unk> Fluss .
In fact , they have been the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And then , what we &apos;ve done is , if you were <unk> , you &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;ve been doing it in the middle of the country .
We &apos;re working on a komplexen scale , and they <unk> the water in the atmosphere .
It &apos;s what we want to do , but it &apos;s not true .
And what you &apos;re looking at is what you see .
And 90 percent of the <unk> went to the <unk> .
A lot of the place , a lot of the African .
And so , in 1982 , on 1982 , we run on the middle of the country .
How did we do it ?
They were doing the <unk> .
You &apos;ve got to <unk> the <unk> .
If they put it in no way , they use the <unk> , and then they used to get it back in their way .
You know , it &apos;s called the <unk> <unk> .
And then , you know , they <unk> a <unk> Hektar <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and a lot of gaps , and there &apos;s a lot of the tree that &apos;s going on .
The <unk> is great .
I mean , we &apos;re going to tell you a way of doing it .
You &apos;re going to pick up a Horizont out there , and you &apos;re going to see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the <unk> Act , and you know , the Great , <unk> <unk> .
I mean , like a long way of doing it , I &apos;m going to be with <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a great <unk> , <unk> Charles Darwin and a <unk> <unk> .
OK ? Here we are , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , get <unk> , and it &apos;s in the middle of it , you know , <unk> <unk> .
Here we have an incredible <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> .
And here we , here , you see , there &apos;s a <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
It turns out to be true , OK , what the größten Teil of the world is in the <unk> <unk> Park in Africa .
Now , what I &apos;m going to do is , you know , you know , what happens is we .
Now , what we say , &quot; <unk> ? I don &apos;t know anything .
I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot;
And so , as well , there would be a lot of the <unk> and Algen and <unk> and <unk> .
Verstehen , I would say , like , I mean , that really , really faszinierend , like , this war really faszinierend .
It &apos;s great , but what I mean , what &apos;s the other .
And then , my husband &apos;s <unk> , I &apos;ve been doing a lot of great , so I &apos;ve done a long time .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> it . I said , &quot; Miguel , what are you doing so good as well ? &quot;
We &apos;re going to pick up the Algen .
I mean , &quot; Well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
Do you have a natural gas ?
What is the <unk> ? &quot;
And then , after me , you &apos;d like to tell you , &quot; You know , you know the animal &apos;s going to have in the wild .
The <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> Plankton , that &apos;s the name of the fish .
The animal is so gesund , and it &apos;s komplett <unk> .
It &apos;s no way .
What could we learn from a farm from a farm that can &apos;t end up ?
And so , the time , I &apos;ve been sitting on top of Rio , and I said , &quot; Well , I said , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; unlike any of your life , &quot; I mean , &quot; That &apos;s where you &apos;re going to live ? &quot;
Now , in a place like that , what you do is , like , what &apos;s going on like a <unk> <unk> .
And we went to the site , and we &apos;ve been looking at the <unk> Gesicht , and you see , like , for some of pink <unk> , you &apos;ve got to see a pink Teppich , you could see .
That &apos;s the great Erfolg , &quot; You know .
&quot; Look at their <unk> , pink .
You &apos;re going to <unk> an <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? I <unk> about <unk> .
I said , &quot; Miguel , but it &apos;s not going to be an <unk> in a way ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; .
&quot; We are about 20 percent of the CO2 and <unk> of the <unk> .
In the last year , you &apos;ve got 600 of the ice , if you have a 250 million of them .
You know , there &apos;s the <unk> and a total of the <unk> private <unk> in Europe . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , there &apos;s a <unk> , who &apos;s going to be good at a <unk> , &quot;
There &apos;s a <unk> game , no .
We said , &quot; We <unk> <unk> , not <unk> .
This is a <unk> network .
The <unk> of the <unk> food .
The evidence of the resilience is the <unk> .
And so what you do is , you know , like , &quot; You know , you don &apos;t have the condition on it . &quot;
Okay , so far we thought .
A <unk> <unk> that can &apos;t end up , and you &apos;re going to be able to <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> .
Oh , yeah , the <unk> of the <unk> that can &apos;t be there .
In a small range of space , they go 250 kilometers away , where they are <unk> , there &apos;s no way to deal with it .
So every day we go 250 kilometers in the <unk> .
And then , in a way , you put them 250 kilometers out .
You know , it &apos;s because , because , you know , it &apos;s the opening weiße <unk> of the border .
No magic .
And so I &apos;ve been doing a <unk> , so I &apos;m going to <unk> .
I said , &quot; Oh , &quot; I &apos;m going to put them 250 kilometers in the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to grow up 250 km out there ?
That &apos;s what they do for the Jungen ? &quot;
And so , for me , what I &apos;m like to do is , like , a Whitney <unk> <unk> .
And what we say , &quot; No . You know , it &apos;s going to work with nothing . &quot;
I &apos;m actually trying to make the <unk> of my <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to make it <unk> . I &apos;m going to <unk> it .
It &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> Geschmack .
I mean , I don &apos;t make it a way .
And when I put it in the Restaurant in the Restaurant in <unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and we &apos;ve got clean , and we &apos;ve got a <unk> on the streets .
Now , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
Now , what we call , &quot; The Haut &apos;s going to like a <unk> .
And so they have a long <unk> , where you have a different <unk> .
There are <unk> to <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
And then , like , &quot; You know , there &apos;s no <unk> <unk> . &quot;
OK , OK , there &apos;s a <unk> that can &apos;t end up .
A lot of <unk> , where you &apos;re going to spend a lot of the value on the <unk> .
And so , what I realized was like , if there &apos;s a <unk> , a <unk> that &apos;s not going to <unk> , it &apos;s a giant <unk> , because it &apos;s the <unk> Sea , because it &apos;s going to <unk> the <unk> from the <unk> Sea .
This is a road from all over the course of everything that we tend to have , chemical <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And when you get away from the <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s the water <unk> , like the <unk> .
It &apos;s so bad , so you have the water <unk> .
It &apos;s no longer going to <unk> the fact that we &apos;re not going to have a <unk> disease , no matter that there &apos;s a <unk> , which is a <unk> of the <unk> , but a <unk> that &apos;s wörtlich .
It doesn &apos;t matter for the other , but it &apos;s a way of mine .
That &apos;s when the water <unk> , it &apos;s in the Atlantik .
Another time in the streets , I think , well , I &apos;m going to have to , and I &apos;m going to have to do it , and , like , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to do , like , <unk> , Derek .
You can tell you , &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to be a mobile phone for lots of food , of course , if you &apos;re interested in <unk> <unk> .
Now , at all , there &apos;s a <unk> , a <unk> , a place , and you have to <unk> , well , you know .
But for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit more like that .
We &apos;re not very <unk> , we <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> from <unk> .
We are at the very short <unk> .
We were interested in local <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> ice .
And then , as you notice , how would you tell you , &quot; You know , there &apos;s a lot of people who have to do well , and you say , &quot; You know , I &apos;m <unk> of pink <unk> , but how would we have the <unk> ?
What are we going to have to take on ? &quot;
I &apos;m listening to fair ?
I &apos;m not going to ask the question .
No , no matter , no matter , because , no matter how to <unk> the world .
In fact , 1 Milliarde are dying .
And 1 Milliarde -- that &apos;s a little bit like you can do , because , for the great Ungleichheit , it &apos;s not the time .
I &apos;m not going to ask the point , because , you know , it &apos;s about the Logik of the <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the whole <unk> , does not have to <unk> , you know , like , like , if you can do it , you know ? &quot;
That &apos;s the <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> from the U.S .
We can &apos;t have thought , well , it &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , which is happening right .
It &apos;s not that there &apos;s no <unk> , and you &apos;re not there .
Now , there &apos;s a day , there &apos;s no longer going to <unk> , no longer <unk> , but it &apos;s not going to be the world &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , but it &apos;s not going to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , no longer , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and no longer , but a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
Do we have the <unk> of life ?
Do we have the question , well , what are you going to do ?
Or do you know , well , what are we going to impact on , in fact , in fact , in order to <unk> , in order to <unk> ?
That &apos;s what you would like to do , look at the <unk> for the patient .
It &apos;s alt and there &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> , a lot , so chemical and <unk> , and it doesn &apos;t make anything fine , you know .
So we don &apos;t have the ökologischen <unk> .
And so it &apos;s like the Modell , like , &quot; <unk> &apos;s two Milliarde <unk> .
You &apos;re going to go nach , Miguel , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but it &apos;s not only a single thing ; you know , that &apos;s what they are , most of them .
And then , when I &apos;m really fine , I think , well , we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
I mean , I mean , I &apos;m fine , because when you think of bad food , it &apos;s fine .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to be looking at , on a permanent <unk> of Science .
And so , in the Bus , I went to the Bus in the morning , and I went back , every day , every day .
And I mean , I <unk> by being able to <unk> my <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> other Welten in other places , and that , in <unk> , my <unk> training .
And , you know , the ideas of <unk> , in the way , I think , &quot; I mean , when I &apos;m not in my school , &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , Frösche , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and , and , you &apos;d like , &quot; <unk> , you know , we &apos;d like the Mikroskop .
You know , I &apos;m a real <unk> .
And yet , all over the world &apos;s &quot; <unk> of the &quot; <unk> .
And I mean , my <unk> for Science Fiction , so it turned out to me , because , what he did was , what &apos;s the späten <unk> of the <unk> , we went to the Mond , so we would have the <unk> of the <unk> , Jacques <unk> , and all of the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the world &apos;s life , and a <unk> of the world &apos;s life that we &apos;ve never seen before .
And so it &apos;s going to <unk> the whole of the Science Fiction .
And I war a Künstlerin .
Let me forget . I would <unk> .
And because he &apos;s not going to be the Videospiele of <unk> , and all the <unk> of <unk> movies , and all of the time in the <unk> , I got to see the <unk> .
You know , you know , we &apos;ve got all , like a child , and you know , in a way , like the Autor in the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> .
And so , my answer to what &apos;s : <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> Welten , these are <unk> , <unk> , all the time .
And so I kept in <unk> , in <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
And what the Kreativität war , &quot; <unk> , &quot; you know .
And he was sort of interesting , like Jacques <unk> &apos;s Jacques <unk> , I &apos;ve got to think about it that he war a <unk> <unk> , right there .
I &apos;m going to have no way to have a <unk> of a <unk> in a <unk> .
It &apos;s quite a way .
And what you do , that &apos;s a place that I &apos;m going to do in the world , you know , who &apos;s going to be so <unk> and <unk> , as anything I know , would like to <unk> the <unk> of the Büchern .
And so I kept going to <unk> at 15 <unk> .
And the same thing that was like , &quot; I found in a small place in Canada , 600 miles from the nächsten Ozean . &quot;
And I really come up with <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> a little bit like a <unk> in <unk> in <unk> , New York , so it &apos;s all about the Grenze of where we lived .
And I <unk> my <unk> , in a <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , New York .
And I &apos;m going to try to see the Ozean , a real Ozean , no after three , when we go nach California .
And in the course of the <unk> 40 years , I &apos;ve got to take a year , 3,000 Uhr , and 500 more in <unk> .
And I , like , I &apos;ve been able to <unk> the <unk> , and , like , &quot; Well , there &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> , so you can &apos;t have to <unk> your <unk> .
The <unk> of the body is so <unk> , and they take a lot of their own choices .
And so , for an example , I &apos;m pretty <unk> , I &apos;ve been looking at the time .
And there &apos;s a <unk> of Liebe for the Ozeans , so it &apos;s a way of doing it .
And when I , as a month , I wählte a <unk> , what you do .
And so , that &apos;s the best way to <unk> the Verlangen , and I would like to <unk> my husband , and I would like to <unk> the <unk> .
And so , as much as I &apos;ve been doing , I &apos;ve been doing the <unk> of <unk> , etc .
Video <unk> , and I &apos;ve got to <unk> , and I mean , it &apos;s impossible .
And so , for the <unk> , I told my story , &quot; Terminator , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; The <unk> . &quot;
And &quot; The <unk> , &quot; I &apos;ve got my <unk> on the outside of the <unk> , and we &apos;ve started <unk> with Filme .
You know , Sag , the two <unk> <unk> .
And the interesting thing that comes from &quot; The <unk> , &quot; which , like , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; which , on the film , on the movie , the <unk> of control , <unk> , <unk> .
And so there was in the <unk> of the soft <unk> , showing you in a film .
And so , sometimes , all the time you were doing , I didn &apos;t have to <unk> anything like that , what I think was like , &quot; What &apos;s the Publikum , the world &apos;s <unk> , <unk> what &apos;s going on the <unk> . &quot;
You know , it &apos;s Arthur <unk> &apos;s <unk> , which , like , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , you know .
And I &apos;m going to become a <unk> .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , this is something like <unk> in the <unk> . &quot;
And so , like , &quot; <unk> two , &quot; was like , &quot; I went down here .
<unk> with <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> into the movie .
And so it &apos;s going to . And so , &quot; And so , we <unk> out .
And so there was the same effect .
Al Qaeda on the Film .
And so , by the way , these are two <unk> of the same way , dead , who , that &apos;s a total of a woman , a total , and a whole woman of <unk> .
And so I started working with <unk> <unk> , my guten Freund <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> and <unk> what the <unk> and what we called , &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
And the <unk> of the day war , dass wir ein Sprung zu einem Sprung machen , an dem wir <unk> Prozesse <unk> , und so , und wir würden direkt zur digitalen <unk> <unk> .
And so , you &apos;ve got to , and you &apos;ve got to <unk> out there .
And yet , you &apos;ve been able to <unk> , in a <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> , where we had the Unternehmen of the day .
And so I would say , &quot; You know , &quot; The avatar , &quot; which says that , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> the <unk> , &quot; all <unk> in <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
And I tell you , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; I don &apos;t think we &apos;d be able to do that .
And so I turned it into the Kühlschrank , and I , you know , the other film was a big deal , like <unk> .
I &apos;m going to go to the Studio as &quot; <unk> and <unk> &quot; in a Schiff .
It &apos;s a <unk> romantic , <unk> Film .
And I wanted to do whatever I &apos;m going to do , &quot; I &apos;ve got to <unk> the &quot; Titanic &quot; .
And so I mean , why I do a film .
And that &apos;s the Wahrheit . You know , the Studio wusste that no .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to get <unk> . We &apos;ve got to <unk> .
We &apos;d like to use them in the press .
It &apos;s quite interesting . It &apos;s because there &apos;s a great <unk> .
I mean , I &apos;m going to <unk> a Expedition in it .
<unk> . That &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to <unk> a Realität .
Because , because of course , I &apos;ve been looking at a real place , which I looked at at a <unk> stage , two and a half a million , in the Norden , would go to a <unk> , not a movie , no matter , but real .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do .
And the <unk> of a lot , we &apos;ve got to <unk> , and we &apos;ve got <unk> and all kinds of things .
And so it &apos;s a lot to me , so much in the way you &apos;ve kept in <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s a very technical thing and the <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re going to <unk> in such a way , where you &apos;re going to live in the dunklen <unk> , where it &apos;s not going to be a way to <unk> than ever .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s when I &apos;m going to live in a <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s quite cool . &quot;
And so I would like , &quot; I would like to pull out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Well , that &apos;s how to <unk> , the <unk> .
It war everything . It &apos;s a little little object . It war <unk> , and what you do , what makes me work to Hollywood me .
Because , you know , I mean , I could see a little bit of <unk> , and we can &apos;t do that , and I would like to <unk> , I would like to <unk> , and I would like to <unk> from the <unk> .
So when you look at some of the before , I think I &apos;ve been doing the <unk> of <unk> , and you know , of course , I don &apos;t think of the time , you know , I don &apos;t think of the time , you know , which doesn &apos;t look at the reason , and they <unk> them .
And what I &apos;d like to do like , &quot; I &apos;ve got to <unk> , and I didn &apos;t do it . &quot;
And so I &apos;ve been doing a very , very bizarre .
Well , I say , &quot; OK , I , &quot; I say , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to <unk> my job as Hollywood , and I &apos;ve got a while there &apos;s <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And so we started <unk> the <unk> .
And then , at the end , they went to the <unk> , and you &apos;d like <unk> <unk> .
We went to the <unk> of the Titanic .
We &apos;ve got <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And what you do , what you do , &quot; I &apos;d like to do in <unk> , and I &apos;d like to do a <unk> , &quot; was never done by doing that .
Nobody else had done in the <unk> . It could not have to work , and we actually have the way to do it .
And so I &apos;m going to have a place in the evidence of the Titanic , <unk> in a U-Boot , and I would look back in <unk> , which is a lot like the <unk> .
And I <unk> a small piece of the space of the Schiff .
Now , when I told you , I &apos;m going to <unk> my mind , and I &apos;m going to make it a little bit in the <unk> of the Titanic .
And what the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> I &apos;ve been doing , because I &apos;ve been doing a place , for the <unk> , for the <unk> of the <unk> , because I &apos;ve been doing a few months ago , when we were , what &apos;s called the Film .
And what the set war on the <unk> of the Schiff .
It &apos;s a very exciting way .
And so it &apos;s because , like , &quot; <unk> &apos;s <unk> , &quot; you &apos;re going to be able to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , in the middle of the way .
It &apos;s quite <unk> .
And vielleicht a little bit that you might think was going to happen , in some cases , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which are <unk> , in some types of <unk> , I think , like , &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> , I look like a reason to <unk> my book .
That &apos;s how to <unk> , and he &apos;s going to <unk> , and you know , what he &apos;s going to do is , like , the <unk> of the <unk> animals .
In fact , there are practically <unk> <unk> on there .
It &apos;s in a Umwelt of <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s not going to <unk> on a <unk> , so we could .
And so the fact that we see the fact that they are a half of 500 pounds of <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
You might think they can &apos;t possibly have .
And so on the same time , I &apos;ve got a couple of things in <unk> , and , like , &quot; , I would think of the Science Fiction .
And I went into the <unk> , quite a story in the NASA , <unk> an NASA <unk> , real <unk> , I went to Russland , I went to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and all the kinds of things that we have to do with the international rooms , and we &apos;ve got to see the <unk> of the developed <unk> .
And that &apos;s amazing .
And what the result is , &quot; I mean , I &apos;ve got to <unk> , and I would love the <unk> in the Tiefe .
And they ran out , so they &apos;ve been <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who , who , was , in the extremes of the extreme <unk> , <unk> , and we &apos;d like , and we &apos;ve got <unk> , and we &apos;d like , <unk> and <unk> .
And so here we were , <unk> Filme , and so on , with the <unk> , and so forth .
I &apos;ve been doing the Kreis by the reason , from the Science Fiction , <unk> , ever , and all this .
And you know , in the end of the <unk> , I learned a lot .
And I &apos;ve been fascinated by the Wissenschaft . And I was going to <unk> a lot of <unk> .
Now , you might think , &quot; You know , that &apos;s where you might be able to <unk> , and you know , Kapitän of the Schiff and all the time . &quot;
And I would say , &quot; I would like to <unk> the <unk> .
I mean , I mean , &quot; I would say , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I &apos;m going to do it here ?
Why do I do that ? How would I get it ? &quot;
It &apos;s no money with these <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s quite <unk> . It &apos;s no longer going to get there anymore .
And the reason I think you &apos;d like to go from &quot; The Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar , &quot; and I &apos;m going to <unk> you , you know , you know .
I &apos;ve been doing all of the movies , all the <unk> <unk> .
No <unk> , no <unk> , no matter . How would you go ever ?
It &apos;s the way you &apos;re doing , for the <unk> , and the Ozean is the <unk> Umgebung that he &apos;s looking at , for the <unk> of the <unk> , and for the seltsamen , you know , it &apos;s a small set of <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> .
And so it &apos;s all the time , like , &quot; <unk> &apos;s <unk> , &quot; you know .
After a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
And by the way , the <unk> , there &apos;s a story like the <unk> , but you know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a Aufgabe that we might have ever thought about other people that are coming out of other people .
You know , when you &apos;re talking about <unk> , and they said , &quot; We &apos;ve got it , and the <unk> , and all of the <unk> , and all of the <unk> , the <unk> order of the Web , you know , you know , it &apos;s supposed to be the <unk> of the <unk> , and you know , you know , it &apos;s supposed to be like , &quot;
That &apos;s a Band from Respekt , from Respekt .
And so when I came out , you know , I &apos;ve got to <unk> , &quot; The avatar , &quot; I would begin to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And that &apos;s true .
And so what I &apos;m looking at with a little <unk> , like , &quot; <unk> , &quot; you know , we &apos;d like , &quot; Avatar &apos;s disease , &quot; which doesn &apos;t do that yet .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
And so , we &apos;re going to have a whole bunch of four and a decade .
And so it &apos;s going to try to <unk> .
And so , you know , a lot of them , you know , because , you know , the streets , you know , the Ozean <unk> , and you &apos;d put them on the side .
For me , what you do , what you do , what you &apos;d like to do was like , &quot; Well , that &apos;s a way to <unk> it .
So , was , was , at all , on all of these <unk> ?
You know , what are the kind of <unk> ?
Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> that .
It &apos;s a <unk> , a <unk> .
<unk> is a way to <unk> the real world .
And there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , if all the <unk> in the world .
He &apos;s a little bit of <unk> , who said , &quot; Give me a Rat to this . &quot;
And I &apos;m like , &quot; Don &apos;t get any person .
Other people have been doing something like ever , no matter , no matter , no matter .
<unk> , <unk> . &quot;
And NASA &apos;s going to be <unk> , &quot; <unk> is not a lot . &quot;
And if you do a lot , there &apos;s a lot to be in love and <unk> , because it &apos;s a <unk> in a place .
And there &apos;s no single disease , which is no longer <unk> .
It &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about , you &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> .
And that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to take you back to you , like , in was , if you &apos;re doing it , <unk> a lot .
Now , when I think of a very nice way , like , I would like you to take a picture of the world , if you &apos;re at the <unk> of the <unk> .
And I think , in order to think about <unk> , I think , &quot; I think we &apos;re going to have to <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> it else .
This is a typical <unk> in the same way .
And I &apos;m going to have to use a lot like this .
It &apos;s called <unk> <unk> . You know , I &apos;m going to take an advantage in one of the other possible , for example .
I &apos;m going to see a different way of looking at the other words .
That &apos;s because there &apos;s a place in the <unk> , and it &apos;s the <unk> .
We don &apos;t have to go back to the <unk> , and they are the <unk> , the <unk> .
Now , we see , <unk> and <unk> , and there &apos;s the normal <unk> , but not for everyone .
Now , when you &apos;re going to stay away , like , if you go to the last two years , if you take a better deal of better , it &apos;s the equivalent of the <unk> .
You know , when you &apos;re looking at it , you know , it &apos;s a matter of what &apos;s happening .
You know , I &apos;m going to have to think like this , &quot; I &apos;m going to have to look at information in a lebenden way .
Now , when you look at <unk> , why would you like , &quot; Why would you like ? &quot;
Now , what you have here , like , there is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , you know , you know .
All right . It &apos;s all right there .
You know , we &apos;re going to go back in the table , and that &apos;s where you go to my Talk .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you fall in a decade .
You know , you know , you &apos;re moving into a number of time .
You know , there are a number of <unk> .
And so I &apos;m going to ask this . I &apos;m going to see the <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> .
I &apos;m <unk> from <unk> Armstrong , so I &apos;m hearing , and I &apos;m hearing all the time , and all of the sudden I &apos;m going to have the <unk> of <unk> Armstrong .
Now , when I &apos;m going to come back here , I think , &quot; What &apos;s going to be like , &quot; I think , &quot; Why would you look at the <unk> ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to start with a place , and I &apos;m going to get them in .
Now , I want Greg <unk> .
You know , like , if you &apos;re going to , like , we &apos;re going to have <unk> , smaller and a <unk> , and we would say , &quot; You know , we don &apos;t want to , like , &quot; <unk> , no matter .
You know , it &apos;s a little bit different .
It &apos;s there &apos;s <unk> , and we think you &apos;re going to change how we use information .
And I &apos;m going to have to do that , I &apos;m going to have a lot of <unk> .
So here we &apos;ve got to have any of Wikipedia , and you &apos;ve got a little <unk> .
And I mean , that &apos;s where you have a little <unk> , and you &apos;ve got to <unk> the <unk> home .
I &apos;m going to show here over the top of the 500 &apos;s <unk> .
And yet , you know , in the way , you have a lot of them .
We &apos;ve seen a way of looking at the period of the time , which you have to <unk> Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to stay in love with , well .
Now , I &apos;ve been behind , I think , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , &quot; Time &apos;s like the <unk> of the World Time .
And that &apos;s quite interesting , because the reason why you see in no one of the <unk> <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s going to go from a place like nothing , and you &apos;ve got to look at it .
Now , when I look at one of my favorite strip I &apos;m hoping for Time , I think , &quot; Time &apos;s <unk> , &quot; I &apos;d like to <unk> them .
Now , a look at all the words in all the people , I would like , dass die Mehrheit <unk> .
Some of them are coming from the <unk> .
It &apos;s a very small number of evolution .
Here &apos;s my Chef .
<unk> is coming from the <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is , that Bono has a TED <unk> .
So we don &apos;t have to jump at all the TED <unk> .
And so , we &apos;re actually going to get the Internet , like , if you &apos;re at the Web , no need to <unk> , not a way to <unk> , but in a way .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about one else , you know , I &apos;m going to tell you about how to <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk here to the students from New York Times .
<unk> , the way -- the way -- I &apos;m not going to be a little bit of sheep , but you &apos;re not going to be a little closer , but you &apos;re going to have the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , so you have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to start with a <unk> , and we &apos;re right , right in a <unk> <unk> .
And the reason why you &apos;re talking about is , like , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> my way so that I &apos;m going to <unk> my way into the same way .
I &apos;m going to try to find a lot in , and I &apos;d like to be able to do in real time .
Here &apos;s where I &apos;ve been doing the <unk> of the slide .
I &apos;m going to have to do a couple of things that I &apos;m looking at today .
Now , when I &apos;m doing a while , I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m going to ask my <unk> , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> my <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing , and I went to <unk> , I would say , <unk> <unk> , and I live there &apos;s <unk> Labs .
You know , I &apos;m going to try to find a way of looking at the <unk> and they &apos;re starting to do it .
And so it &apos;s a Metapher that makes you like , and it &apos;s all the time , and it &apos;s all the way it &apos;s made to the sum of the world .
In fact , in the middle of the world , we look at them as a <unk> .
You know , we &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> of <unk> .
We &apos;ve been interested in <unk> .
Now , when we &apos;ve got to , like , you know , we &apos;ve got to <unk> , and you &apos;ve got to <unk> the Web in a way , and we &apos;ve got a lot , so we &apos;ve got a lot more about all kinds of things , and we can &apos;t think of it in the face of it .
Now , when you look at it , we don &apos;t have any good , you know , if you &apos;re going to , you know , you might have to know how to <unk> .
It &apos;s no matter how to have any of the time , you know , you know , you know how to <unk> .
Now , when you know , like , perhaps , you know , you know , there &apos;s dead <unk> .
And so , thanks to a lot .
You know , I mean , I mean , everybody &apos;s going to be interested .
Now , I &apos;m going to have a couple of these kinds of things , like , dass die jüngste 5 Jahre , &quot; <unk> &quot; in the magazine , and it &apos;s about 40 , and it &apos;s a lot to get it out .
He &apos;s a total interessiert , a lot of <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
I mean , everyone else will be happy .
But , trotz the <unk> , he &apos;s able to have different <unk> <unk> , which , like , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;d like to think of <unk> .
And I &apos;m probably going to have the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
You see , the same thing you do , and you have to think about their kinds of music , and you see , for example , for the reason , it &apos;s about the same thing , because it &apos;s like , like , &quot; we &apos;re all right than everyone else .
Die <unk> is die <unk> , <unk> .
So what you think you &apos;re going to have to look at is not going to be wrong , because , you know , you know , there &apos;s a lot like that .
And I &apos;m thinking , if there was a particular reaction , what you might have to do is , but anything like you can &apos;t have to <unk> , and we have to <unk> the ability to <unk> the <unk> .
The point is , the <unk> of the <unk> and Erinnerung : &quot; You know , there &apos;s going to be going to be , &quot; I &apos;m going to be going to be dead , &quot; I &apos;m going to be going to be happy about the story of glücklich .
And those are two ways , which are a lot of <unk> in the <unk> .
And the dritte <unk> is the Illusion of konzentrieren , and someone &apos;s realizing that we don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to have an expression , which is no matter what you would have .
I mean , this is actually a <unk> <unk> .
He &apos;s not going to have a few reasons .
Now , I &apos;m going to start with a couple of times in a <unk> , and I would tell you about one of my youngest students .
And what the story war .
Now , what we say , &quot; There &apos;s a <unk> idea , and it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and am Ende of the <unk> , what he &apos;s going to do , he &apos;s going to be a profound <unk> Geräusch .
And so , what we say , really , really <unk> , like , this whole <unk> <unk> .
You know , no way .
It could be the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s what it looks like .
And what happens is , what we do , like 20 Minuten amazing science .
They weren &apos;t <unk> , because we had a <unk> , and that &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and then what we do , what we do is , what we do .
Now , the reason why this is because , you know , you might be and others like two .
He &apos;s a <unk> of the world , and there &apos;s the middle of the world to live in the middle , but the animal .
You know , what happens to you , &quot; I mean , when the Arzt is , &quot; I mean , when the Arzt is , &quot; Are you going to get better than I &apos;m here ? &quot;
And so he &apos;s going to <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> , and I &apos;m going to have the head of your life , and it &apos;s like , &quot; You know , what &apos;s going to be like , &quot; You know , what are we ever doing at a time ? &quot;
You know , &quot; You know , what we &apos;ve got in love with <unk> . &quot;
These are two , and I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; , I think of the <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
And so that &apos;s true , there &apos;s a very likely to see the same effects of the Erinnerungen .
We don &apos;t tell any of the story , because we were listening to Geschichten , you know .
Now , there &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> , and you would say , &quot; You know , you know how to pay a story .
And let me start with a couple .
This is a <unk> .
All right , there are real , <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show you the Einzelheiten . This is no bit more <unk> , but that , <unk> , like , in the <unk> of 90 .
They got to spend a lot of 60 numbers in their efforts .
And those are three of them .
These are <unk> .
And he &apos;s doing , &quot; How do we have the best Schmerz ? &quot;
And that is a very simple question .
And so you can tell , &quot; You know , there &apos;s a good fan of <unk> .
There &apos;s a long way of doing a long time , and a lot of a lot of times , with a parent A , he &apos;s doing something , and it &apos;s a lot of it .
But here &apos;s another question here : How do you think of it ?
And what the amazing thing is : that Patient is a very , a much more <unk> Erinnerung like a parent in the future .
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s a pretty different view of the story -- and no one &apos;s an all of the <unk> is quite inspirierend of <unk> -- but one more that it feels about other .
And the <unk> Geschichte is , like the <unk> <unk> am Ende .
That &apos;s a <unk> .
You know , what &apos;s the world , because we &apos;ve been doing them , and it &apos;s a lot , so , &quot; What &apos;s the place all the place , all over again ? &quot;
And what &apos;s interesting about it , and it &apos;s a matter of B , in their view .
Well , there &apos;s a straight <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> .
And by the way , what I &apos;m going to do is , &quot; I &apos;m like B , &quot; I &apos;ve learned a great place .
You know , was going to be with Patient A , and there &apos;s actually clinical clinical trials , and you &apos;ve got to have the <unk> of Patient A , and then you &apos;re going to be able to get there , and he &apos;s going to get there , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to get inside it .
And so , you will have the Patient <unk> , but no longer , and it &apos;s a lot , and it &apos;s a lot more like it .
And then , when you get a few Minuten , you know , I &apos;m going to take a little bit of a little bit of <unk> , and I would like , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> a lot of a lot more about my father &apos;s life , because ever a parent has a good thing about their way .
Now , was there a story ?
And it &apos;s like , &quot; You know , there &apos;s a lot like the <unk> , &quot; and it &apos;s the reason for the <unk> .
There &apos;s a picture of the very <unk> , quite a good scale and <unk> .
<unk> are very , very interesting , and in the case , what am Ende the <unk> .
Well , I &apos;m going to <unk> my home live .
It &apos;s about the view of the way , at the other .
And then , how would you have the time ?
And the answer is real .
You &apos;re going to lose whatever .
I mean , the <unk> of my life -- I mean , it &apos;s like , &quot; The psychological world is going to get about three Minuten , you know .
You know , you know , in a way , it &apos;s about 600 Millionen .
In a Monat , it &apos;s about 600,000 .
All right , they &apos;re not going to <unk> .
I &apos;m going to make no way to make the last time .
And yet , you know , you have a different way of being able to <unk> , like , in fact , in the case , the same thing in the world &apos;s life .
It &apos;s the <unk> material that we &apos;ve <unk> on the planet .
And so , what we think is , what you think is relevant to you , but it &apos;s not that I &apos;m going to <unk> for you .
So we have the <unk> and I &apos;m going to <unk> and it &apos;s quite different .
The größten Unterschied of each one is in the same way .
And by the way , what I &apos;m going to do about is , at the end of the <unk> , I &apos;m going to have a Urlaub , and it &apos;s a month , a little bit like the process of a second than the beginning of a year than the beginning of a decade .
Now , that &apos;s not going to be the <unk> .
Now , for the <unk> , I &apos;m actually doing a process of doing a process of doing a little bit better when the beginning of a decade , but he would have to <unk> a lot of a lot .
You know , it &apos;s no way .
And so , in fact , there is a critical variable that I &apos;m talking about when I &apos;m talking about a <unk> .
In fact , there &apos;s a lot of a lot of going into the story .
I mean , I mean , I &apos;ve got to think about it , and I would have to think about it and my mind .
It &apos;s the answer to the future , but when you get a parent , it &apos;s like , if you have a parent , you would have a look at some two different Chirurgen , and there &apos;s a lot of them , and then you get the Chirurg with a fairly bad view , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
I mean , I &apos;m not going to have ideas in these choices .
You &apos;re going to pick up all the time .
We &apos;re going to pick up an audience from the time . <unk> , and then , when we think of the patient , we think we don &apos;t think any of the same time than most of them .
We think we think a lot to be like <unk> Erinnerungen .
And so you can think of it as a result , as a result of the <unk> , and I would like , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> my way , &quot; I would like , &quot; I &apos;m going to have a little bit like , &quot; that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to be doing , &quot; I &apos;m going to get the <unk> in the Urlaub for the last time .
And that &apos;s interesting to me .
I mean , how would we have to do a lot of change ?
That &apos;s one of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
And when I was thinking , I &apos;m at a Urlaub in the process that we &apos;ve been doing at a few Jahren in the Antarktis , which is exactly what you do , and I think , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> with other <unk> .
And I &apos;m probably going to get my Erinnerungen in the Urlaub of the process for about 25 months for about 25 Minuten .
Now , when I &apos;m going to have a picture of the picture , I &apos;m going to make a big deal with 600 pictures .
That &apos;s three Wochen , and it &apos;s fast a long time .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
Now , what I &apos;m going to do , can be quite a little bit , a little bit , really , really , where are the <unk> , but , like , &quot; Well , I think that &apos;s the <unk> , why are there so many reasons , why are you going to <unk> , &quot; I mean , you know , how would you <unk> a lot ?
I &apos;m going to have to think about a <unk> .
Now , you know , you know , ever in the beginning , you know , in the beginning of the Urlaub , ever going to be <unk> , and ever <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
Now , what we &apos;re going to do is , where we &apos;re going to pick up a little bit , and when you &apos;re going to be able to <unk> a different way from the two <unk> .
And so they would have to figure out , &quot; You know .
It doesn &apos;t mean that when you think it &apos;s like , than ever , than ever ever , you have a number of answer .
And when you think of the <unk> , you might have a different answer .
Now , what you have to do is , what you &apos;re asking for , you know , that &apos;s a lot that you &apos;re going to do with a lot of different <unk> .
Now , the two <unk> are three <unk> of the same <unk> .
He &apos;s right there , if you &apos;re going to <unk> , I &apos;m going to <unk> , one of them .
Now , what are you going to have to ask , &quot; What &apos;s the last thing I &apos;m doing ?
And how would we have to ask , &quot; What are you going to be at the time in the middle of the home ? &quot;
And so it &apos;s all -- the <unk> of the Momenten is a little simple Prozess .
What are the Emotionen that have gemessen ?
Anyway , you know , we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> , and I &apos;m going to try to <unk> the whole way .
Now , when you &apos;re going to <unk> , I &apos;m going to be a total different experience .
That &apos;s not where you &apos;re going to be happy next .
You &apos;re going to have to think about how about <unk> the future than you think .
<unk> differently .
Now , any of those might have been <unk> with a lot of the <unk> , and I &apos;ve got <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , and I &apos;ve got a lot of the <unk> of the <unk> , so you know , the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> , so you know .
The exception to the <unk> of the <unk> I and the <unk> of the <unk> , and he &apos;s at the time , and there &apos;s a lot of those , if you think of the <unk> , where you think about their <unk> and for an hour .
And it &apos;s a lot to do in the cause .
Also , the South African , so we &apos;d like to <unk> the <unk> of the world .
And the reason I &apos;ve ever been , I think , is , &quot; I think , &quot; I think it &apos;s really different .
You know , you can think of anything else with your life , and you can &apos;t find quite a little bit less about how glücklich you suffer from .
You know , we want to make a picture of the <unk> , which is the <unk> .
You say , than ever , than ever , then , what might you have to say , &quot; You know , there &apos;s a bit of a range of Europe , &quot; I mean , there would be a lot of people like there ?
You know , I mean , you know , I mean , you know , I mean , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
And so I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , you know , somebody else &apos;s going to be eight , two , two , two , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to give you an audience .
So that &apos;s what the needle is schwach .
You know , you know , I mean , you know , I &apos;m going to see , was going to <unk> .
You know , there &apos;s nothing worse , there &apos;s a lot of reasons .
You know , you know , bad , you know , pretty much , no longer than you are talking about the people that we are doing .
He &apos;s other <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
Now , when you &apos;re going to have the bad ones , you have to be able to give you an answer , you know , you know , the most important thing you do .
Now , I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; , you know , we don &apos;t think we might be able to think , like , &quot; You know , if you don &apos;t think anything else .
It &apos;s a different way .
And so , very quickly , there &apos;s a different talk about the reason we don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to spend on the same time as you think , and when you think , you know , and , like , you can &apos;t have the same time .
And so when we have a simple question , you know , you &apos;re going to have no good answer in California .
When we ask the question , &quot; You know , people are glücklicher in California than ever <unk> in Ohio . &quot;
And then , as ever as a matter of the Lebens in California , there are the Kontrast of California and other gaps , and the Kontrast of the same time .
It &apos;s because , like , the Klima doesn &apos;t matter for the <unk> , and I don &apos;t think , &quot; I think , &quot; I &apos;m going to have to <unk> , you know , you know , you know .
But , because of course , I &apos;m thinking , &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to <unk> you , you know , some people in California .
And so it &apos;s interesting to me , nach the course , was going to be in order to <unk> the <unk> in order to <unk> .
You know , their <unk> , no glücklicher way .
You know .
You know , one of the time . You think , &quot; You know , it &apos;s glücklicher , but when they &apos;re thinking about it , &quot; you know , what &apos;s going on in Ohio .
And so they might think , well , they have a lot to work .
It &apos;s interesting to think about <unk> , and I hoffe I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; I mean , I mean , I mean , &quot; you know .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you so much .
In fact , when you were at a few Wochen , we told me that he was a very interesting <unk> , a very interesting <unk> .
Do you have a couple of <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know a few more ?
Daniel <unk> : And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I mean , that &apos;s a very interesting reaction to you .
It &apos;s like , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> .
Now , when you look at the way , you &apos;re going to <unk> differently .
It turns out to be the <unk> of 60,000 dollars per year , for the same , and , for example , it &apos;s about all the very großen , <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of 600 Dollar , with a network of 600 Dollar per year ...
CA : 60,000 <unk> : 60,000 60,000 dollars per year , als <unk> , en ze werden <unk> , and they are alive with poor .
<unk> , we have another shell .
I mean , I mean , I do selten you have to look at the shell .
And so it &apos;s true , and it &apos;s because , you know , it &apos;s not going to <unk> any <unk> , but you have no longer going to get a bad deal , and we would have the <unk> of the problem with great , absolutely , absolutely .
On the other side , I &apos;m going to have a very different story .
That &apos;s how much money ever makes you believe .
It doesn &apos;t matter for Emotionen .
CA : But , Danny , the United States , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
As a result , if you have a second , it &apos;s all that you might think , &quot; I mean , you know , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , there &apos;s no matter .
Now , does he have a number of <unk> , dass das Land <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , right ?
<unk> : I mean , I mean , I think , I think it &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
And the answer is going to be langsam in the United States , which doesn &apos;t create Zweifel , but in the country , it &apos;s happening in the place , and in other other countries .
You know , the first thing you might have to think about how they think are good , than they think , would have a good place .
You know , it &apos;s going to have to go back to the point of <unk> , and you have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , so we &apos;ve got to have the opportunity to have to have the opportunity to get people .
You know , what you &apos;ve been doing is your different way of giving you , and I think you &apos;re going to <unk> for the <unk> .
You know , there are the state in the kommenden <unk> .
In the United States , they &apos;ve been doing the <unk> of the individuals .
All right , I think about a year of 20 percent of the national Statistiken .
CA : Well , I think it &apos;s like , &quot; I think there &apos;s going to be <unk> for the last few years . &quot;
And so , thanks very much , for the story of the <unk> .
Thank you , Danny <unk> .
I mean , I mean , I mean , I would love you , and I would love you .
And what you might do is think about <unk> , because my <unk> &apos;s work , you know , you know , and , for the course of the time , you have to <unk> , and that &apos;s where the ärmsten are , and , for the ärmsten two Milliarden .
You know , physical and Klima , quite positive for the people , in the same way , in the world .
The Klima <unk> , so they don &apos;t have their <unk> .
He gets there there , there &apos;s a lot of it .
Things that are going to change the way to make their fragile environments .
And so you would like Hunger . It would be dead .
That &apos;s where you &apos;re going to have an emergency place for them .
The cost of breast cancer is quite interesting .
In fact , when you &apos;re going to <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , we would have to get cancer , and then you have to <unk> that .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> .
And so the <unk> caused by the industriellen Revolution , and so on the 20. Jahrhundert , what he &apos;s doing is a very schnellen <unk> of Elektrizität , and , for example , we don &apos;t have these kinds of <unk> Materialien and so many of them .
And so , there are a wonderful way of doing Elektrizität in the <unk> .
So , if you do it , we &apos;re <unk> , and we &apos;ve been doing so much as much as well , and that &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on with CO2 .
CO2 to <unk> the <unk> of the planet , and the Gleichung of CO2 is a very simple .
Now , when you &apos;ve <unk> , the CO2 <unk> , who would like to <unk> , and the <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of very negative difference .
They &apos;re going to find out of the <unk> and , you know , you know , the <unk> Effekte , which can &apos;t look like the <unk> changes , and so it &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to get the <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s why , so , that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to go from a number of CO2 , and you &apos;re going to have the positive <unk> , and there &apos;s all the <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s a lot .
And so it &apos;s a <unk> story about how much it might be , but it &apos;s quite <unk> .
I &apos;m thinking about <unk> .
Can &apos;t we have a way of doing that ?
Are we not going to have any of a place in a place ?
And the answer is , if you &apos;re in the middle of the course of the city , there &apos;s actually a movement .
And there &apos;s a great deal .
It &apos;s very different from a couple of four feet in a way that you get at the <unk> of <unk> feet , which are right at the <unk> .
There &apos;s nothing like that .
Now , we &apos;re saving a lot of CO2 , if 26 Milliarden Tonnen .
Now , for every animal , it &apos;s about 20 Tonnen .
In the poor of the poor , it &apos;s a lot like that can &apos;t grow up .
It &apos;s a single Durchschnitt for about any of the planet .
And so you have to , like , you know , how to change the time , you have to do that .
It &apos;s going to come together .
And so , in the same way , it &apos;s a lot of <unk> , so we don &apos;t have an increased rate in a lot , and , at a very far , zero .
Now , the answer is four Faktoren .
It &apos;s a little <unk> .
And so , you know , there &apos;s one of the links , CO2 , which you have to do , and that &apos;s where you have a chance of <unk> , the Durchschnitt , the individual , and the CO2 <unk> on the <unk> .
That &apos;s how we &apos;ve got to look at the bottom line , and you see , you know , you know , we &apos;ve got to zero .
Now , maybe one of the people in the palm of the city of English .
You know , there &apos;s a <unk> of education , but we have a look at this .
First , they have been .
Now , there &apos;s the world &apos;s life today <unk> .
That &apos;s an area that goes to about neun Milliarden .
Now , when we &apos;ve been working on the same way , like , like , if you &apos;ve been working on , like , <unk> Gesundheitswesen , like , you don &apos;t have to get , like , 100 of 15 percent , but here we have a Anstieg to about 1.3 .
The second Faktor is , the cure for which we use .
That &apos;s all the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
These are very , very bad things , and the <unk> of the nation , you would think of every single person in the planet .
That &apos;s the great way to get there .
In the finite world , what you have to do is the top of the number 1 Milliarde , and you &apos;re probably going to <unk> , and you &apos;re going to have the chance to get the chance to get the <unk> service of the people on the other .
Here &apos;s a very simple Service .
Now , what we &apos;re doing in the middle of the Hause , I mean , let &apos;s say , &quot; You know , that &apos;s not going to work , and they &apos;re like , &quot; You know , we &apos;re going to get the <unk> of the <unk> .
That &apos;s , <unk> , E , all the <unk> .
Now , we have a good number .
We don &apos;t have to have a place .
And most of all sorts of reasons and various ways of <unk> , you know , other types of times , you know , other types of times .
It &apos;s a lot of Dienstleistungen , if you have cancer , that &apos;s a lot of loss that you have .
Some people , with 90 percent .
He &apos;s other services , so you know , you know , you know , like , if we &apos;ve <unk> , you &apos;ve got a lot of a lot smaller than there &apos;s disease .
And so , when we &apos;re optimistic , you don &apos;t have a different range of anything , you know , you know , a number of three <unk> .
And yet , for those three , three trends , no average , a total , 13 <unk> , and there &apos;s no way .
So we &apos;ve got to have the <unk> <unk> -- there &apos;s a <unk> -- and that &apos;s the CO2 <unk> by <unk> .
The question is , &quot; You know , don &apos;t you know ?
You know , like , <unk> , no .
When you get Erdgas , no .
If you take a long way , you &apos;ve never <unk> Elektrizität , except over the <unk> and Atomenergie , does CO2 .
And so , on the same way , we have to do a new <unk> .
That &apos;s how we got <unk> .
Now , when I <unk> the Begriff , I &apos;m not going to have something like that .
The <unk> is a <unk> .
The Internet , and there &apos;s a business model .
So , these are all the <unk> <unk> from all the beauty .
<unk> , don &apos;t have <unk> , when you have to <unk> a few times a few times .
You &apos;re going to say , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to go , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Now , that &apos;s a place where you have to be done , and you &apos;ve got to have a message in a <unk> Agenda .
Now , I think , &quot; Well , what are I going to have to do ? &quot;
Does it sound like this , if you look at the <unk> , it &apos;s like , &quot; You know , you would like to <unk> the <unk> ?
And I &apos;m thinking , like , like , like , like , like , like , I &apos;ve got a lot like our <unk> <unk> , and you know , you know .
And so , you know , it &apos;s quite a story that he &apos;s doing on the other way .
That &apos;s how we &apos;ve got to remember .
And so I kept going to <unk> , my Beitrag for the Umwelt here .
So here we have to have a natural <unk> .
And I &apos;m telling you , &quot; You know , it &apos;s not going to <unk> , it &apos;s not going to try to mind the game .
And so , it &apos;s also all sorts of <unk> reactions like , but they can &apos;t do anything .
We &apos;ve got Lösungen , many of them , in a very <unk> Maßstab , and , of course , in the <unk> of <unk> , and , like , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve got any of the other things , you know , I think , three who &apos;s going to increase an equal amount .
I &apos;m going to get <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , what you do know anything like that , and when you think it &apos;s good , I think , &quot; I mean , I think there &apos;s no one ever going to have any of the five and all of the three and we can &apos;t do it yet , because it &apos;s all their very special deal with them , because all of the most interesting time .
Once we &apos;ve got to have an fossilen Brennstoffen , you &apos;ve got some <unk> , <unk> by Erdgas .
There &apos;s nothing like you can do , but it &apos;s not .
You &apos;re all going to get all CO2 on the <unk> , and you &apos;ve got to put them in , and you &apos;ve got a lot of them , and you &apos;ve got all the time .
Now , there are a couple of <unk> that you have on the average of 60 percent , but there &apos;s 100 percent , there &apos;s a lot to be a lot , and you can &apos;t see , well , if you have CO2 , it &apos;s the <unk> .
How do you know ?
Now , how does it <unk> , you know , if you paint down to it , you might be able to think of it in terms of <unk> of other things like this ?
This is a giant <unk> .
That &apos;s what happens .
The guy is <unk> .
Now , these are three major Problemen .
The cost , &quot; <unk> countries , &quot; which is a big deal .
The whole thing to do all of the security , can &apos;t do anything right , so you know , all of you are going to have the <unk> of <unk> , like , &quot; <unk> the <unk> , &quot; you can &apos;t use it .
And was , like , &quot; How do you deal with it ?
And , although it &apos;s no longer , it &apos;s a lot of it .
You have to have a really bad way .
And so , there are three more interesting Problemen that can be <unk> , and I think , well .
The last three of the five , I &apos;m <unk> .
And so , there &apos;s a lot of the people going to have to be called , &quot;
And so it &apos;s -- well , what &apos;s great , you know , it &apos;s no risk , but you have a lot of power .
One that is , like , one that &apos;s the <unk> of the breast cancer , by the way , is less like the <unk> .
This is <unk> , if you &apos;re at a very large level , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you have a normal movement , you have a normal movement .
These are the <unk> <unk> .
The oil doesn &apos;t matter the whole day , and so it &apos;s not every day , and , so it &apos;s kind of <unk> .
And so , when you &apos;re dependent upon the <unk> , there &apos;s a way of being <unk> , like , if you &apos;re not going .
And so , there are big <unk> here .
We are <unk> Herausforderungen .
So , for example , you &apos;re going to have the supply chain of your country , if you &apos;re going to have cancer , you know , no need , you know , of course , a lot of the amount of money coming from anderswo .
And , after , it &apos;s the <unk> Problems .
And so , you know , I &apos;d like to look at all the types of animals that are being designed , for the <unk> , for the <unk> , for the <unk> , for all , and for everything , and , first , that &apos;s the amount of electrical power that you &apos;re doing , and I would like , &quot; all of the species that we are doing , if all of you , if you all of the time , if you all over the 10 Minuten of all kinds of life and all over
And so , there are a large Durchbruch from there , you have a number of 100 percent more likely to have the Ansatz that we have .
It doesn &apos;t matter , but it &apos;s no way .
And so it &apos;s interesting if you will have the <unk> stem cells , if 20 bis 30 percent of the people ever use .
Now , if you &apos;re 100 percent , they have a <unk> .
So how are we going to have <unk> , was there a lot ?
Is it <unk> ? What are you going to do ?
Well , there &apos;s a lot of the rich people that have the <unk> .
In every one of those three , 10 and 100 percent .
And most of them , let &apos;s say , yeah , yeah , it &apos;s good .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; I think there &apos;s a lot of people that have been doing at all .
Bill <unk> has several Firmen , including a <unk> called the Great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the amazing ones , and I would have to have to have to <unk> .
Nathan <unk> , and I &apos;ve been working with a <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
He &apos;s a couple of <unk> in some of these <unk> , <unk> , and control control .
And he &apos;s actually not going to have a lot of freedom in the world , so it &apos;s no way that he &apos;s working very well .
And the reason , like <unk> , is , like , no one &apos;s a little bit of a little <unk> , a percent , but <unk> , they didn &apos;t have the 99 percent , <unk> .
It &apos;s a little bit more like that .
You have to have to think about it , but actually , you could never forget anything like this .
That &apos;s where you &apos;re going to <unk> , you know , and yeah !
You know , with the soft Materials , it &apos;s probably going to have to .
And because of the 99 percent , it &apos;s the cost of <unk> .
You &apos;re going to use the <unk> , and then you &apos;re going to use all the <unk> <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
That &apos;s where , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , this is great .
It &apos;s the <unk> in the answer . It &apos;s a <unk> .
You know , we &apos;re going to see the &quot; <unk> of the <unk> <unk> &quot; .
So , if you &apos;re like , like you have the <unk> , there &apos;s a really nice way .
I &apos;m at a time at Kentucky .
This is <unk> , 99 percent , which is a number of percent .
It &apos;s called <unk> Uran .
That &apos;s pretty much for the United States .
And so , you know , in a billigen way pollution would get , you know , you have an entire side of the planet every Earth .
And so , it &apos;s a lot of Herausforderungen for the patient , but it &apos;s a little bit of a couple of <unk> and hundreds and thousands of people who have cancer .
So how are we thinking , how messen we ?
Now , what do you have to look at here ?
Let &apos;s have a look at where we have , and we have the <unk> .
In 2050 , there are a lot of people at the time .
And so it &apos;s quite interesting to you .
And so , 20 percent of the world is going to use , a place .
And so , so we have no high <unk> , and we have a lot of them .
And so , for the 80 percent , they have the <unk> countries , including the country , like China , their <unk> , their <unk> .
And the other side of the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> the country in all the <unk> , and so we &apos;ve been doing that with somebody else ?
That &apos;s quite interesting .
This is a really interesting thing like a story .
Now , how would you have to do before 2020 ?
Well , you know , there &apos;s a lot like that .
We don &apos;t have to get the income diseases of the world .
You know , how much more we don &apos;t have less CO2 , and that &apos;s how it &apos;s unique .
In mancher Hinsicht , the average number that we don &apos;t have to do is , like , if you don &apos;t have the great <unk> , it &apos;s something like that , or maybe something like that , it &apos;s the <unk> of the woman .
And so the reaction you have to do is <unk> , and we have the level of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the way .
So here &apos;s a tremendous amount of attention to you .
The next one of Al Gore , &quot; Here &apos;s the <unk> , &quot; The Buch David <unk> , &quot; The <unk> of David &apos;s Buch . &quot;
You &apos;re right there , and you &apos;re going to have to <unk> , and you &apos;ve got to be able to have an area , because , you know , you have a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of the people .
This is a difference .
It &apos;s a very systematic Wunsch , which we are erfinden .
Now , when ever , a matter of the future , I would say , &quot; I &apos;m going to pick up a relationship with a <unk> , &quot; I could <unk> a Impfstoff , I would tell you something like that , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> something like the benefit of the cost , no matter what &apos;s going on .
That &apos;s a story like the <unk> .
When you don &apos;t have the Wunsch , the <unk> among the people who think they have a lot to look like , in a long way , about the United States and China , all the poor and most of the life , and , well , the life of the two Milliarde are worse .
So , was , was , was there ?
How do I ask people ?
We have been working on to <unk> , <unk> .
When you &apos;re living in a lot of time than Copenhagen , they don &apos;t mean any of the CO2 .
And so they have to spend the <unk> , and we &apos;re given to a little bit of the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve got <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all this cost to be <unk> .
We have the <unk> <unk> .
You know , there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> , including the way they get the law .
There &apos;s a different Wunsch , but I &apos;m thinking , &quot; I &apos;m going to get it right .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
I &apos;m going to know , I would say , &quot; Well , I mean , I mean , I would like you , &quot; I mean , that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to be able to make an advantage of the time ?
And Bill Gates : That &apos;s because of the <unk> , all the <unk> , all the great <unk> , was , like , there &apos;s only 10 thousand , and so you know , we &apos;ve got a lot of animals in a <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> is going to be the <unk> <unk> , which are the number of thousands , the <unk> , the political <unk> , and so the place we do , &quot; That &apos;s what you do .
Now , when ever , when you &apos;re going to have , like , the <unk> , like <unk> , it &apos;s perfectly <unk> , because the diseases , the <unk> , so it &apos;s different than that .
CA : And yeah , yes , yes , and yes , yes , right , there &apos;s a lot like that , right , where are you going to take out of the world , fast as the <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> <unk> , and how would you get the location and so forth .
BG : That &apos;s true . It &apos;s because there &apos;s a <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of people , and there &apos;s a lot of the <unk> to people , and it &apos;s like , &quot; OK , it &apos;s there , you &apos;d like , and you &apos;ve got to work with it .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
Now , as a result , when you get a little bit , you know , you &apos;re like 60 dollars , but it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s all the way the <unk> .
And he &apos;s right and it &apos;s the 60 60 Jahre , and then it &apos;s done .
CA : It &apos;s a <unk> , which are really <unk> .
BG : Yeah , it &apos;s a matter of doing it , you &apos;re going to have -- it &apos;s a lot like that -- it &apos;s a lot like that , and you get it in a different way , and you get it in a different way .
And so we &apos;re going to start with the <unk> , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
That &apos;s where you &apos;re going to start .
And so , at the same time , you know , a lot of the <unk> in the world is actually <unk> , and you get the <unk> , so it &apos;s going to dramatically dramatically increase the Prozess .
CA : In the global age of all the time , it &apos;s the most interessiert , an awful lot to deal with it ?
BG : Well , we don &apos;t have a place yet , and it &apos;s all interesting , and it &apos;s all interesting <unk> , because , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , like , the <unk> of the living in Russland , India .
I mean , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> of life , and you &apos;d like to spend , for example , in the <unk> .
And so I &apos;m optimistic . You know , that &apos;s the Franzosen and the <unk> , the <unk> .
This is a <unk> in which you &apos;ve done .
It &apos;s quite a nice place , but it &apos;s a little bit like a <unk> <unk> , and most of the time , you know , and all of the time , you know , an actual <unk> <unk> , you have to <unk> the world .
CA : In a way , like , in a way , it &apos;s like , <unk> and the Wahrscheinlichkeit that you &apos;d like to do in the middle ?
BG : Well , we &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> on the very large level that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , like , for 20 years , we have to think about it , and they would spend 20 .
Now , this might be like the <unk> of the <unk> , where we have <unk> .
And , you know , <unk> , when everything else goes , it &apos;s a lot of people going .
And so it &apos;s been older , most of the time , there &apos;s hundreds of thousands of times , well , among them , they have been working well , like , well , how to deal with them .
And so it &apos;s the best way of doing it , but you &apos;re going to use a lot of the <unk> of the same time .
We have a lack of <unk> .
CA : In the same way , in the same way in the big way , it &apos;s the reality that you know ?
BG : That &apos;s a <unk> .
And so it might be , like , &quot; No way to <unk> , but <unk> the <unk> , so it &apos;s true .
In the <unk> are other <unk> .
Now , you know , you know , we don &apos;t know how to do that , but the <unk> of the world is another Ansatz .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s doing things like that , but you can tell you .
So it &apos;s also different , but the Schönheit you have a <unk> , so it &apos;s going to produce so much as a <unk> , and so when you &apos;re going to , with the negative impact , the <unk> and the cost , the potential , there &apos;s a lot like the <unk> of the planet and all the time , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> on the planet and all the time , right .
CA : How would you do it , was there ?
Sollen &apos;t we start with the <unk> of <unk> , and we &apos;ve got to get there out of the world ?
BG : When we go to the point , we &apos;re going to have a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to have a <unk> <unk> .
You know , if you &apos;re going to get there , you know , if you have it , you have to be able to have cancer .
And he &apos;s an amazing example , the <unk> <unk> , which are the most powerful , which are the <unk> of two of the 30 years ago , and we &apos;ve got to <unk> for 20 or 30 years .
So that &apos;s a very useful way .
You &apos;re ever going to have that guy .
Some people say , &quot; Well , we don &apos;t have to work in order to <unk> , because they &apos;re going to have food , &quot; because you know , it &apos;s a <unk> , you know , because it &apos;s a <unk> , you know .
I mean , I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , like , &quot; I think , &quot; but he &apos;s going to have the <unk> last thing to happen in the <unk> of the same time , when you think of it , it &apos;s because of the amount of horses , when you think of it .
CA : <unk> <unk> : How would we tell you , how would we tell you , &quot; You know , we can &apos;t get it ?
BG : Well , surprisingly , the <unk> of the planet .
He &apos;s very wenig that he &apos;s there , it &apos;s a lot of the reason .
Are they going to make the negative possible features that we would have to do with the natural <unk> ?
It &apos;s a very , very small of the things that you &apos;re looking at , if you &apos;re looking at a million in a million .
And the original Problems , like , there &apos;s a problem like AIDS .
You &apos;re going to have a place , and it &apos;s a lot of it ever received .
And yes , when ever , like ever , there &apos;s all kinds of <unk> Problems like that , you know , that &apos;s why , you know , you know , -- and that &apos;s a lot of <unk> Schmerzen .
In addition , the <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s not going to get the <unk> time , and he &apos;s going to have to <unk> the world &apos;s IPCC and saying , &quot; Okay , it &apos;s all that way .
And so it might be the <unk> that we &apos;ve been talking about .
But my Traum is , like , like , like , like , as ever as the <unk> , and you get the <unk> , they would say , &quot; I don &apos;t want to say that it &apos;s no CO2 on it , I might want to <unk> CO2 , but I &apos;m going to <unk> , because it &apos;s no way to <unk> CO2 , but I &apos;m going to <unk> out .
CA : And so , well , what are the answer to <unk> <unk> , like , if you &apos;re all the <unk> , you know , if you &apos;re all the time , you &apos;re going to have to <unk> the <unk> of the Armut and the Malaria , and so on .
And so you can think , &quot; Well , you know , that &apos;s a really bad <unk> , &quot; when he &apos;s able to deal with their own kinds of time .
BG : Well , the real cost , the R &amp; amp ; quot ; like the United States of 10 Milliarden , if you have 10 Milliarden dollars , like that , no dramatic .
It &apos;s not going to be <unk> in other ways .
It &apos;s quite a matter of the very large , and you can consider all the <unk> of minds , when you have to <unk> something like that , it &apos;s going to prevent anything else .
That &apos;s , like , for me , at a very <unk> .
<unk> , we &apos;re going to have a <unk> , and they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a very <unk> .
I mean , you know how to have to have to have the <unk> , there &apos;s a lot to be able to have a lot less bigger .
Now , when you start the world &apos;s disease , we &apos;ve got to make sure , well , that &apos;s the mass of the world .
I mean , we &apos;ve got all over there , and we &apos;ve got all over the same time without being able to have the Lifestyle ever to have any home .
The <unk> for the two Milliarden .
And then , with <unk> <unk> .
Now , what you say is , &quot; You know , why don &apos;t you want to have R &amp; amp ; D .
And there &apos;s a good thing to say , but , but , under the <unk> , &quot; You know , there &apos;s going to be a little finite space , and so , there &apos;s going to be the <unk> <unk> .
And so he &apos;s going to go on the top , and I &apos;m an answer .
And so it &apos;s easy to do , you know , because it &apos;s worth three .
CA : Well , Bill , I &apos;m going to see , I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> , &quot; I &apos;m going to have a lot to get your Wunsch in <unk> .
BG : Thank you .
I &apos;d like a couple of years ago at a few Monaten , when I saw a few years ago , when I wrote a Artikel of the <unk> Wired .
I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a sense of how I &apos;m going to <unk> , but I &apos;ve been doing that , &quot; I &apos;m not going to make the word &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
I &apos;m going to give you the <unk> .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
<unk> : gesundes , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
And I read that for a Freundin , and you weren &apos;t laughing to laugh , because it goes out to &quot; <unk> &apos;s <unk> , &quot; and I would stop , and I would stop looking at , because of the emotionalen Schock and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
All right , that &apos;s what you do , you know , my <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of <unk> , right .
But what you do , what a lot of <unk> was like , when I started , I &apos;ve been working on the Grundschule , and I started to <unk> my own home , and I &apos;ve got to care about the other children , and all over the other day .
I don &apos;t want to say , &quot; I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
In fact , what you do is , like , what I think is , like , if you were born in one of my life , I think , when you think about it as a person , I think , &quot; I think , &quot; right , I &apos;m going to <unk> with the potential and <unk> that I live in my life .
And so I kept thinking , &quot; I went to the 2009 <unk> , &quot; and thought about a guten <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> no longer .
And I &apos;m probably going to tell the world &apos;s &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , &quot; My &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
That &apos;s not about Worten .
And so it &apos;s because , for the people , you &apos;d say , &quot; You know , we ’ re going to be saying , &quot;
The role of the stories , and , and , you know , and , you know , we <unk> the stories .
And there &apos;s no need to think , and you have to think of the world , and you have to look at other people .
In fact , there &apos;s a lot of the institutions that look at the Griechen and the <unk> , glaubten , dass das <unk> einer <unk> so mächtig war , denn wenn man etwas <unk> , das <unk> .
Why don &apos;t we have to do that , so the person who is <unk> , or something that is <unk> ?
Now , when we were doing so , when you think about it , when the <unk> of a person , a little , if you and all , if you and all <unk> , we &apos;re going to love them .
Do we have no cure for them ?
Now , come back to my efforts for me , what my Arzt like , when I was a kid , I went to the <unk> , <unk> Institute of <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s Dr. <unk> .
<unk> , but what you see , what &apos;s really interesting about , what &apos;s called , Dr. <unk> , what &apos;s Dr. <unk> .
Dr. <unk> <unk> had a lot of <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of the <unk> <unk> with children .
And I kept doing all of that in the age of the <unk> , except for the <unk> .
I &apos;ve got a way of doing that , working with the Great <unk> , and I &apos;d like to <unk> the Great <unk> , to my <unk> .
I mean , I <unk> the <unk> for all .
And I <unk> them , he told them . I hasste them .
And so , as I went back , I &apos;ve been working with Dr. <unk> , and I &apos;d like to <unk> , you know , <unk> .
In a few months , it came back in one end -- <unk> and <unk> , and said , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s , Aimee , we &apos;re doing so much , <unk> my <unk> , <unk> , I &apos;m going to <unk> my <unk> .
You know , like , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> 100 Dollar . &quot;
Now , what you do , what you do , what &apos;s called , &quot; I &apos;m not going to work with my <unk> , &quot; I would never want to deal with it , &quot; I &apos;m going to spend a lot of my <unk> , <unk> my <unk> , a day , a day , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
In fact , I think , in <unk> , I &apos;m going to be able to <unk> , and my <unk> &apos;s <unk> , my <unk> , which is my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> in a way .
This is a little example of how Erwachsene to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
In the course of the most important , the most important of the world &apos;s disease , the reason we &apos;ve ever got to the realities of the realities that we &apos;re all going to do , to look at the individual person , and we &apos;d like to <unk> them .
In fact , there are the &quot; <unk> &quot; in the ability , and it &apos;s a lot of them , and a lot of them .
You know , with a <unk> , my Beine , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> with their own <unk> , and you would like to <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you can <unk> , so you can <unk> , and , you know , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , people can <unk> up with the world .
Now , what you might have to see is actually a lot of <unk> that have been doing anything like that , &quot; I mean , &quot; you know , everybody &apos;s going to have an awful lot , and there &apos;s no reason to have an experience , &quot; and that &apos;s why , you know , the best way we want .
And the way to fit together will be interesting , because everybody &apos;s going to have all the time with me , because of the <unk> , I &apos;m going to get there .
And the reason , &quot; I don &apos;t have anything like anything , and that &apos;s why , <unk> to science , &quot; and I &apos;d see why .
The <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; or &quot; <unk> , &quot; or &quot; <unk> , &quot; more <unk> , <unk> , like my grandfather &apos;s disease , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of a way to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of a way to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , was more like my <unk> .
In Wirklichkeit , in Wirklichkeit , there &apos;s no way we &apos;re talking about a <unk> , emotional , emotional .
And my argument is , &quot; Well , that &apos;s a good thing .
<unk> is not at any time , because , you know , you know , you know .
It &apos;s a Teil unseres Lebens .
I mean , I think , like , &quot; I &apos;m going to try to see it as an <unk> .
Now , again , I think it &apos;s a lot of , yeah , really small , but it &apos;s always .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to make a difference , and I &apos;m going to have a bad story of the doctor .
He &apos;s <unk> and a lot of them , and all of them , and all of everyone else , but that &apos;s not going to be between the <unk> , but you &apos;re going to stay right .
So , there &apos;s no matter how to <unk> , no matter how to deal with <unk> , but they got more gut in there .
Now , what you do is , if you don &apos;t have a service , when we &apos;re able to make them , we don &apos;t feel like , &quot; You know , we can &apos;t fit into each other .
He &apos;s a different way and Unterscheidung zwischen the objektiven way , that I &apos;m a <unk> , and the <unk> , I think I &apos;m going to be interested in <unk> .
Well , I think , really , that &apos;s the <unk> , which I &apos;ve been looking for , is telling me the <unk> .
In a matter of course , we &apos;re going to <unk> , so from all , if you &apos;re going to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; of course , a <unk> of the <unk> Qualität of the <unk> , so you can &apos;t see , &quot; You know , you know , we don &apos;t have the <unk> Stein of the world , &quot; you know .
Now , I think , well , there &apos;s a way of thinking about it , and you can &apos;t do it , and you have to do something like that , &quot; You know , you can &apos;t get the <unk> .
If you &apos;re not going to <unk> from &quot; The <unk> of &quot; <unk> , but we don &apos;t see a different way , a different way to the natural <unk> that you know .
In fact , there &apos;s no value to the value for the world .
So we have to think about the <unk> community , the <unk> of menschlicher Fähigkeiten .
And the reason is that there &apos;s a Kooperation from the <unk> and all the best kreativen Fähigkeiten .
He &apos;s not going to <unk> the schwierigen <unk> , if there &apos;s a matter of the <unk> <unk> , but , and , you know , the potential in terms of <unk> .
Now , what might be like , &quot; I &apos;m going to have to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , no way to get it , and you &apos;re working with , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , it &apos;s going to <unk> .
Now , when you look at the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s no longer going to <unk> with <unk> .
And so the Jahres , you know , the <unk> Geburtstag Charles Darwin , and when , like , like , like , like , like , like , like 150 Jahre , I told you , &quot; <unk> Darwin &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
It &apos;s pretty <unk> , and it &apos;s not that the <unk> of the <unk> , but the one &apos;s the best <unk> to the Wandels .
<unk> is <unk> .
In some other ways , you might have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , this is a tremendous feature .
By the time , you know , you know , we don &apos;t know , at all , you know .
Now , what you see is , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a sense of their very <unk> .
We don &apos;t want to have a <unk> .
We don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to <unk> , when it &apos;s about being a good time .
You know , you know , we might look at the same way .
<unk> is true , where we don &apos;t have any difference , you know .
So I &apos;m telling you the wichtigsten <unk> , which we have , &quot; <unk> &quot; .
How else is it right ?
He &apos;s not normal .
He &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s typical . He &apos;s not normal .
And how would he have the poor , <unk> , who &apos;s still <unk> ?
I think that no .
Now , when you go to <unk> to <unk> , you have to <unk> , and you &apos;ve got to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , like , &quot; <unk> &apos;s <unk> , &quot; and , you &apos;ve got to <unk> , and , and , you know , a lot of people , and all kinds of money into the community .
<unk> , you know , a lot of you have ever got to have any person in the world , you know , you know , there &apos;s nothing wrong in the world .
He &apos;s what he said , &quot; Well , you know , 60,000 years ago , what we are studying is going to <unk> <unk> , but what the <unk> and the <unk> of the world &apos;s going to , &quot; <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , they &apos;ll see , as a result , it &apos;s <unk> and impossible .
Vor a few Jahren , what I &apos;m going to do in the <unk> in the middle of the sun , I &apos;m going to get <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s Sommer . I &apos;ve got a kurzen reference .
I remember saying , &quot; Well , like Aimee <unk> , &quot; you know , like Aimee <unk> . &quot;
I was telling me , what &apos;s a älteren thing you do . I mean , like , what &apos;s like .
I said , &quot; You know , you know ? I don &apos;t want to know it . &quot;
You say , &quot; You know , we don &apos;t know anything like that . &quot;
In fact , when we &apos;re working on there , I &apos;m going to have to come from deiner Mutter . &quot;
Oh , the <unk> .
And so , even a lot like the <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , you know what a lot of my Arzt , you know , I mean , I would like to <unk> my <unk> of my <unk> , because I &apos;d look at at the last Geburtstag of my Geburtstag .
And my <unk> &apos;s <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> , which you were doing in the Urlaub , which was like , &quot; What &apos;s the <unk> for my Eltern . &quot;
And because of course , I &apos;m not born , and I &apos;ve got a bunch of devices , and a few Zehen in a row , my husband , &quot; I would say , &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a bad lot to give them a bad lot .
And what happened like , &quot; I would say , &quot; I would tell you , &quot; I don &apos;t have to <unk> , and I don &apos;t have to <unk> the <unk> , and you would have to be able to have a <unk> of my life , and you know , you know , I &apos;ve been talking to a <unk> of me , &quot; I mean , you know .
And the key thing , you know , what we say , &quot; I &apos;ve got to <unk> , &quot; which , like , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> in the zweiten <unk> , <unk> the <unk> in <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
And so , what you would call the <unk> , the Potential of the human being .
You can &apos;t <unk> , you know , you know , if we might be able to think of the <unk> disease than being the <unk> of the person .
Dr. <unk> <unk> , &quot; And she said , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> , as a result is , &quot; a way to get a lot of people in it . &quot;
You know , Arzt <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
And he &apos;s going to tell you , &quot; He &apos;s going to be different <unk> and a lot of people going .
And in the middle of the time , my thinking is , because , when ever , as <unk> , I would <unk> my <unk> , I would like to take a place in real place .
In fact , I &apos;ve got to <unk> my <unk> .
Now , when ever , you know , I &apos;m not going to do it right .
And so it &apos;s because of the kind that I &apos;ve been doing , no , all of the time .
Now , maybe that &apos;s in me , I think , because I &apos;ve been doing a lot of people , my <unk> , like , &quot; I &apos;ve been sitting and <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , if you have a human being , you know , you know , a way of being <unk> , and it &apos;s ever .
Now , as a result , a story , what you would like to do , you know , like , &quot; You know , you &apos;ll be able to get someone like that , &quot; you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ll be able to get someone like that , you know , you know , you know .
You would like , &quot; You know , we <unk> , &quot; right .
And so , &quot; The reason &quot; said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
It was like , &quot; You know , there &apos;s a lot to <unk> , <unk> .
Now , what are we going to have to do with the point ?
He was in the <unk> of 60 in England , and we went from <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s called &quot; <unk> . &quot; In the world , we have the <unk> .
You would spend a lot in 10 , 9 , eight , seven , <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> , the best of the most wonderful Lehrern , etc .
In fact , a year from three Monaten , they <unk> 10 , and we told them they were <unk> , and they were smart .
Am Ende of these three <unk> , they <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> was like , dass sie die <unk> erzählten , dass sie <unk> .
And that &apos;s at the same time at three Monaten .
Now , that &apos;s what they had in the middle of the school , and I &apos;d like to call the <unk> .
And a very exciting <unk> in the last year , that &apos;s what the teacher did , for the <unk> .
The business weren &apos;t supposed to be doing anything like that .
He said , &quot; Well , these are the Studenten of <unk> , the <unk> .
And so they went , and they went , and so forth .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , you know , you know , that &apos;s a bad way .
There &apos;s no Schönheit .
Now , there &apos;s no natural , <unk> to <unk> , no such one , and no such one of us , if you have to <unk> .
And when you get into no way , you can &apos;t have the way to go and get Schönheit in them and others , and , you know , and , you know , we have a lot to be good for a lot .
Now , as a result , like a way to get their imagination , we have to <unk> , like , &quot; <unk> , &quot; like that .
I &apos;m going to take a look at a month from a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who , my colleague of Jacques <unk> told me .
It &apos;s the Gedicht , &quot; The <unk> of the four words . &quot;
&quot; In fact , &quot; nobody &apos;s aware of God , no God of <unk> , no God of <unk> , but all four of them , you know , are the four of them , <unk> , ready to come with me .
Thank you .
