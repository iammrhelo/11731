Vor a couple of years , Peter <unk> here , in TED , <unk> .
The <unk> .
The thing that &apos;s very simple , very simple : <unk> of four , so much in the same way as well as in 20 <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
The Marshmallow has to <unk> .
And , but , anyway , that &apos;s very simple , but that tells you very much , will get people to get very schnell together .
And , when I looked at this very interesting person , I entschied , in a <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s a huge <unk> .
In fact , I &apos;ve been doing these things in about 70 <unk> Workshops in the world , Designern , Designern and Architekten , and even mit Chefs of Fortune <unk> .
And you know , you know , you know , in the same way , in the way people zusammenarbeiten , and I &apos;m going to have a couple of them to share .
At the same time , the first one , is that people are <unk> .
So they &apos;re talking about , think , for the way that it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> .
Dan <unk> .
They and <unk> Spaghetti .
And the amount of time around the time , you know , the <unk> <unk> .
And am Ende , when the time that comes out to the moment , do you get somebody to put them on them , and they put it on , and they &apos;re <unk> .
We bewundern them .
But really , really , really , at least , is that the <unk> effect in &quot; oh , &quot; in the <unk> , because that &apos;s the thing that <unk> in the very slow <unk> and <unk> .
Manche other people have more about the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
They lie , they ’ re <unk> , they ’ re <unk> , they ’ re very stressful <unk> .
And , in addition to the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
And the best in the best is <unk> .
This is amazing .
And Peter said that , you know , they &apos;re not only the <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re very <unk> .
And so , as you might be thinking , well , why ?
<unk> Antwort is : &quot; Don &apos;t der Kids , no day for the <unk> , &quot; Right .
They don &apos;t have a <unk> .
But he &apos;s a <unk> .
And that &apos;s the <unk> that we can do for the richtige richtige Lösung .
And then they do that .
But was it , when they put it out , when they put it down , is that they have no time .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
Klingt that .
This was a very different way .
ist , when they start to start it .
They <unk> Prototypen , and they &apos;re <unk> .
With all of the things out there , so that they have fewer Chance , very <unk> <unk> .
One of the things that the kind of <unk> is as the <unk> <unk> .
In every single letter , the children have done directly with a <unk> , and that was not working .
And so the <unk> are very <unk> .
But let &apos;s imagine the <unk> <unk> .
The Durchschnitt for the meisten people is about 50 inches .
<unk> , for those of us , are the <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> , more than the meisten Erwachsenen .
How does the best ?
<unk> and <unk> .
The very <unk> <unk> , I have a <unk> .
And why ? Because they <unk> , and <unk> <unk> Strukturen , the <unk> Strukturen , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , good .
But now , it &apos;s interesting : when you get a <unk> in the Team , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> . The <unk> .
You can see that right . And why ?
Because it &apos;s good to <unk> .
They manage , <unk> .
And every single Team , it &apos;s very good , and it &apos;s a lot of <unk> for the <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> suffer in <unk> .
When they asked to be 10 Gruppen at the same time , he &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> .
And I was looking interesting .
I thought , well , it &apos;s fun .
So I <unk> 10,000 $ an <unk> .
And what was the <unk> ?
What was it ?
One .
Not a <unk> <unk> .
One <unk> , as well , a Zoll , which is a <unk> .
The thing that &apos;s interesting is that there &apos;s a huge amount of achievement .
We took all of these things around the world .
And what was it ?
You know , well , they &apos;re <unk> .
And this is the <unk> Team of the best Team in one of the best .
They were the <unk> <unk> at the time .
This is a good <unk> for us to be on the <unk> .
Man fragt , &quot; Well , why can you get an opportunity to write a <unk> <unk> ?
The talk is , I have a lot of digital Werkzeugen and Prozessen to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> can get them out to the hidden face .
Because , frankly , every country &apos;s Marshmallow , right ?
We have a very <unk> experience , and a very <unk> teacher , which has a very intimate <unk> .
And so that &apos;s the <unk> of all of these things are simple .
And for example , <unk> , <unk> .
So in this blog , you can see , you have the <unk> .
He &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
He &apos;s kind of a lot of people to be on all of the world &apos;s technology and <unk> .
He &apos;s <unk> .
And the <unk> , I think , is a <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> guide all of our Sinne , and that &apos;s where we think , fühlen , and <unk> for the Herausforderung for the <unk> .
And for a small Prototyp , all of a sudden , in <unk> , in <unk> , in a <unk> situation in a <unk> situation .
And that &apos;s a huge difference .
Vielen Dank .
So , let &apos;s have even closer to a Maschine , which is a huge Machine , a lot of cool , <unk> Maschine , and it &apos;s still a Zeitmaschine .
And everybody here is .
I mean , for the time , in the time , in the time , in the time , in the time , but not here , and now .
I &apos;m going to be older , and I want to ask for the last time that I had all this question for all of these questions , and all of a sudden , all of a sudden , I have to stand .
We all have to go back in the day for the day before that <unk> or <unk> .
I don &apos;t know .
I mean , I have a certain kind of <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> .
And I can do this .
But I don &apos;t have to talk about that , I &apos;m sorry .
I don &apos;t have to go back , and I don &apos;t have to be so <unk> , but I have to be <unk> , but , but , you know , you know , the <unk> .
We don &apos;t have to look at the <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to be in the <unk> . I &apos;m going to get in the time .
In fact , in the <unk> Zeitalter of the day , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in the world , living , wealth , Mobilität , Mobilität , <unk> , <unk> .
We don &apos;t have a time back .
My <unk> starben only one 60 .
My Großeltern took over 70 .
And so I have to get out there for 80 .
And so I like to play in a lot of the way in the 90 .
But there &apos;s nothing to be on .
He &apos;s a lot more on the Spiel .
In fact , in the way in which in New Delhi , right now , has a Lebenserwartung to be right to the <unk> you &apos;re 100 .
Think about that . That &apos;s a <unk> .
And why is that ?
The Pocken . The Pocken haben Milliarden people auf this planet , <unk> .
We have an impact on the Demographie of the world of the world .
They don &apos;t exist . They &apos;re gone .
We have a <unk> . <unk> !
In the <unk> world , the disease , which has a Generation of <unk> , as well as no longer .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Now , you know , here &apos;s what was happening ?
<unk> , modern living environment , for <unk> , are all <unk> for Milliarden of all <unk> .
And for me , there &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they don &apos;t have any of the most successful Errungenschaften der Menschheit .
That &apos;s the good news .
But , for sure , it &apos;s very good enough , but it &apos;s a couple of very good Neuigkeiten , but for the fact that they are very <unk> , and one of them , for all of all of us , is that all of all of these people , in the end all of all , has to be in the world , every day .
We have a lot of <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> .
And not only do you know , but we have to use all of our imagination in the world .
<unk> water , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and as soon as we don &apos;t have to be <unk> from the <unk> , we don &apos;t have to be <unk> in the <unk> way , so we can go away .
The question is , well , I think ? I think .
I think it &apos;s obvious that , in fact , that means that , in fact , in <unk> , for those of you , for those of you , for those of you , for those of you can live in life .
I mean , I think in the fact of the fact that these Welt can &apos;t get to the <unk> .
I mean , really , really , really , really , yes , that &apos;s no <unk> .
But now , you know , at night , I wake up at night -- one of the things that I lie at night .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you weren &apos;t going to be so much , and no longer , and so on , you know , so much in the way that you can use that .
In fact , at the time , at all , at all , at all , at all , in all of the places in all of the places .
And I think really , really , really , really , really slow down , but 300 years old , but 300 years old , for the time , for the <unk> , for a minute , that &apos;s <unk> , and in all of you , you know , you know , in the <unk> , and in all of you , you know .
The point is that , in fact , the <unk> <unk> , so that it &apos;s fast unmöglich , that &apos;s fast unmöglich .
And I mean , everybody &apos;s right to be right in their own minds ; every one has a right to be an equal to the <unk> , but if you don &apos;t have to be right ?
Now , they don &apos;t have to be right at all . They don &apos;t have .
And I have a long time to do that .
Vor 10 years ago , I had an <unk> of <unk> for the New Yorker , a short story .
I mean , I found a lot of <unk> , which actually , in fact , that actually , in fact , the most effektivsten <unk> for the public health has been in the <unk> .
I didn &apos;t know a very good thing to do , so I didn &apos;t have to write a story , but I didn &apos;t have to do it .
And a little bit later , I had to tell a story about genetically modified .
Again , that &apos;s very , very , very <unk> .
People are magic .
And so I didn &apos;t have to talk to him , but I didn &apos;t know why , but I didn &apos;t understand why people looked at the <unk> , which they thought they were Molekülen in <unk> , anstelle them , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
But , you know , I was working . I was a <unk> , and I had an <unk> and I went on to the order of all .
But all of these stories , I had to stand in , but I didn &apos;t believe , but .
And for the fact that the <unk> that they have , they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
They were <unk> , okay .
So , as the people in this room .
And the thing that &apos;s as though I was so <unk> ...
But , when I thought , you know , let &apos;s say , let &apos;s face it , right now , in a minute , in the world , where you don &apos;t have any more equal Verhältnis as <unk> .
He &apos;s <unk> .
Now , he &apos;s sorry to be <unk> as <unk> .
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
Okay , so far , I think , well , I know , and I think , I know , we know , we know .
We have an opportunity in Institutionen , in <unk> , and in <unk> , and in fact , in the world , and he &apos;s not talking .
You know , but they have a couple of set tests in <unk> , and people understand .
<unk> , <unk> , the Challenger , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I mean , you know , the <unk> .
And he &apos;s going to talk to them and Problemen , for the people who thought that they were very accurate .
<unk> , too .
Now , let &apos;s ask a question , <unk> and <unk> , don &apos;t have a <unk> .
But now , it &apos;s like , &quot; Well , when you &apos;re <unk> , you have to <unk> , and there &apos;s no way .
And I mean , I mean , I mean , you know , I mean , you know , that &apos;s where you are dead in a dead way , and , you know , in the <unk> , and you realize that they are so <unk> .
Over 12 years ago , he has a profound telling , which has a relationship between the <unk> of Autismus and the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> .
So a couple of thousands of years ago , that &apos;s what happened .
And so that &apos;s what they needed ; it &apos;s a terrible job .
The data <unk> .
In the United States , in England , in the U.K . , in the U.K . , in the United States , in the <unk> , in Canada , and all of that , they don &apos;t .
But it doesn &apos;t mean , it doesn &apos;t mean , it doesn &apos;t have to be <unk> , but an <unk> , you know , <unk> , you know , that was real .
We don &apos;t have an opportunity to get a lot of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s <unk> , and I can do it , and I can do this .
But was it ?
In fact , that was enormous , dramatic , and indeed , indeed , the United States , the United States is one of the very few countries in the world , for the <unk> <unk> .
And this is a Schande , and it &apos;s a Schande , and we must schämen .
Not very serious .
What is it mit all of us in it ?
I can do it . I can <unk> .
So how do you get <unk> ?
Does anybody notice that you &apos;re going to be looking at one person in <unk> ?
<unk> .
And here all of you don &apos;t , but in fact , but in fact , in the world , in the world &apos;s <unk> .
This is a <unk> billion by <unk> , 20 / 50 .
But here , because there &apos;s no way that it &apos;s <unk> , and people as an <unk> , and people as a <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> in <unk> , as the Oprah and Larry King Live <unk> .
And they can do that , because they can &apos;t react to the ground , they can &apos;t react to things .
They don &apos;t know , the other things that seem to be very similar to that , but it doesn &apos;t mean real .
And this is etwas , das wir lernen müssen , and that &apos;s why it can be <unk> .
This one , you know , this was a Helden , Jonas <unk> .
And there &apos;s an <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
Not a <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . <unk> !
In the middle , you know .
Paul <unk> .
In fact , there &apos;s a Impfstoff for the <unk> to the <unk> .
This is a half to 12 to 500,000 children in the <unk> .
Right ?
Well , it &apos;s very good , except for Paul <unk> , to <unk> , and , as wertvoll as they are .
And so we can get them to stop <unk> .
And so , so much .
This is Paul <unk> .
So , when you have an <unk> Vortrag , you can only do the <unk> .
So , there &apos;s a <unk> , because he &apos;s giving up to the fact that they give them an opportunity to tell them that they know what their children are .
And why ? Because Paul has a Impfstoff .
I don &apos;t have to tell you , but I &apos;m going to have an <unk> .
We are <unk> and Krankheiten , and they &apos;re <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> .
In this country , we have <unk> .
And so it &apos;s very , very soon , to reach out at the end , soon he wants to reach out to the <unk> .
And they don &apos;t have to be <unk> .
Was for Polio ?
And a former <unk> <unk> schrieb me in a couple of Wochen , and she said , &quot; I got to get a <unk> <unk> .
No one , no one .
We didn &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
In no Fall .
Well .
Now , why ?
Now , in fact , not a <unk> .
But , as you know , he &apos;s going to be a <unk> at a <unk> in Lagos , and there &apos;s an <unk> in Los Angeles , and there &apos;s an <unk> .
In a couple of days , in a couple of minutes , <unk> , and <unk> , and in Long Beach , there &apos;s an amazing Beach TED Talk .
And you don &apos;t realize that , you know , that &apos;s a <unk> Krankheit , and you know , it &apos;s not <unk> .
This is the planet , in the world , where they don &apos;t .
We are <unk> to lie in Lügen in Lügen .
Does everybody have to be <unk> ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , so <unk> , so <unk> ?
I mean , because of the U.S . , every single day .
They <unk> them , and they &apos;re using alternative choices , and they don &apos;t have to do it , and they don &apos;t have to prove that , they &apos;re useless .
All of the time , the <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> in the cloth . And virtually no longer .
OK , as you know , the 28 $ <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then it &apos;s so .
<unk> . <unk> .
Why do we mean ? Well , why ? I think I can do it , I think , I can understand Big <unk> .
We hassen the government . We can <unk> the <unk> .
Anyway . The <unk> .
In fact , for the <unk> of the <unk> .
In fact , they &apos;re very <unk> and <unk> even for those of you who can get them .
And so he walked away from away , and where are we going ?
We &apos;re in the poor big placebo .
It &apos;s fantastic . I &apos;m a big placebo .
But , you know , this is very much <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , and we &apos;ll offer Milliarden dollars .
I have a couple of these things here .
<unk> , Täuschung , <unk> , sorry , sorry , I don &apos;t even know what it &apos;s like , but I don &apos;t even know what was it , but <unk> .
And you know was ? Because when I start to start asking these people , I &apos;m going to start asking , &quot; Well , what do you do . &quot;
She &apos;s very good . &quot;
And you know was ? You &apos;re wrong .
Because I don &apos;t have to feel like the <unk> der <unk> , who said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m <unk> , I don &apos;t even know what to tell my Experten about <unk> . &quot;
Or the other person who has a better cure for the <unk> .
And when they start to meet with Beweisen and <unk> and <unk> , they don &apos;t have to be <unk> , where they don &apos;t .
And then , in the South Africa , in <unk> <unk> .
In fact , for the first of all of the people , for the first of all , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , they were <unk> <unk> , who could get <unk> Mitteln .
Six hundred years ago , in a country , in a country that has been <unk> by the <unk> .
I don &apos;t tell you , I don &apos;t have to tell you all this thing .
They have them . They have them .
Now , there &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , in this case , in this case , in fact , that <unk> Kampf between the <unk> of genetically modified <unk> .
It &apos;s a terrible Streit . It stops .
<unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s a Ideologie , no <unk> .
All of a sudden , all of the <unk> Reis , every single <unk> , every single <unk> <unk> , every single <unk> <unk> , has changed .
Just as far as he said , &quot; The <unk> Paradies . &quot;
There &apos;s no <unk> .
No <unk> . They &apos;re all of us .
In fact , in the number of all 11,000 <unk> .
Some of these Produkte , and they didn &apos;t miss .
You know , we weren &apos;t <unk> .
Now , you can do that in <unk> ways .
And in fact , there &apos;s a <unk> .
Now , but you can <unk> a number of <unk> A to reach back and live , and live and live lives .
This is not true ?
I have to tell you , I don &apos;t .
We don &apos;t have genetically modified .
And why ?
Now , that &apos;s all the time , which means that too much Chemikalien , Pestizide , Hormone , <unk> , <unk> , you know , no giant Felder , it &apos;s <unk> .
We don &apos;t have to do this for the developing world .
We don &apos;t have to have the <unk> <unk> .
And you know , I &apos;m sure ?
You know . Let &apos;s have to do it .
It &apos;s true . The <unk> is überwältigend , but that &apos;s no <unk> .
We didn &apos;t have any special <unk> .
This is an <unk> , <unk> , Patente .
The world is no longer possible .
No country .
They don &apos;t look at a <unk> .
This is a <unk> , and they work , and they didn &apos;t work .
But the reason that we have to do , we have to stop the leaders , where you have a lot of time , because he &apos;s having a lot of <unk> , and reach back and reach out and reach out and reach out and reach .
In fact , in the end , in the end 50 , 70 percent reduction in 70 percent as well .
70 percent .
In fact , the distribution of wealth in Africa for the last 30 .
<unk> . <unk> .
They have to have the real experience and we thought .
And the world &apos;s talking .
You know , we don &apos;t need to <unk> any <unk> as <unk> .
<unk> is the average <unk> of a halbe billion people ; it &apos;s kind of a <unk> .
It &apos;s only a <unk> . <unk> .
We don &apos;t have to play Nährstoffe at the same time as Proteine , and Wissenschaftlern , there &apos;s a <unk> .
The way they can do is , they can do no blind .
They didn &apos;t need to verhungern verhungern , and they know was ?
And so it would be nice . It doesn &apos;t seem to be a <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s okay .
And I mean , all of the things I have , is that , why aren &apos;t we ?
I mean , let &apos;s say , let &apos;s think of this , why can we stay ?
Because we don &apos;t have to control the genes ?
This is <unk> from the Genen . Isn &apos;t it a <unk> .
Now , for those of you , for those of you , for the <unk> of the <unk> , you need to be more , more , and more , more and more , and <unk> .
It has no Rice <unk> , it &apos;s an <unk> .
And so , you know , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , that will be <unk> .
Because , right ?
When you don &apos;t have to do it , and not so much , you know , it &apos;s guilty , you know , you know , it &apos;s guilty , right ?
I don &apos;t have any other way to look like that .
And it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s hässlich , and it &apos;s hässlich , and it &apos;s wirklich etwas .
And so , as you know , too , too , too <unk> <unk> , might be like to say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , so I &apos;m going to carry on with this secret Time gallery ? &quot;
Absolutely . I &apos;m sure .
Now , you know , you know , in the Gegenwart , but we have a huge Chance .
We can see the Time Machine for all of us .
We can put them in eine Zukunft in eine Zukunft , and they are <unk> , and they are <unk> , in an <unk> .
We have to reach out to the <unk> , and we have to stop thinking , but , but , but in the time , and in the time , it &apos;s very , very good , very good .
I mean , you know , I can do it , and that &apos;s for me , I think , was there , etwas , that the world knows .
Thank you .
Thank you .
The <unk> of Los Angeles Times ...
Steve <unk> , walked at a minute ...
From the center of Los Angeles ...
, when they were going to be <unk> Musik .
One of you .

And 30 Jahre später , in 30 years .
In the ärmsten Straßen of Los Angeles .
You can have to be Steve &apos;s Buch reading the film .
Not only for the beautiful Band .
Those of these two people were born .
But , you know , to see the role of Musik gespielt .
<unk> Rolle , as I said , I like this as well .
<unk> from the street .
I witnessed <unk> in 2008 .
In a <unk> , in a <unk> .
There was a <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> Symphonie of Beethoven .
And he looked down , and he looked up .
There &apos;s a <unk> and <unk> way .
<unk> and Hillary Clinton .
<unk> said that the Dodgers didn &apos;t follow the World Series .
All of a sudden , <unk> <unk> .
In letzter of the vierten Symphonie of Beethoven .
We were going to talk about Musik .
I mean , the <unk> , I think , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , you know , that <unk> will not be used .
Then , when she was a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> ...
And that &apos;s got to be a <unk> .
You know , that &apos;s where you &apos;re now .
<unk> of Schizophrenie .
In the very schlimmsten place , ...
In fact ...
And in fact , in short .
The <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> lebt in the <unk> and the Unordnung in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> is in such a <unk> .
When we started our first <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> glow in the Augen .
And so on .
There was about ...
<unk> Dämonen and <unk> .
And so he got to be <unk> in the <unk> .
I ’ d ’ t mind .
Not for me , I &apos;m sorry ...
I think I lost you ...
I think , in a way , in this practice .
And I think there &apos;s a very <unk> thing to do .
I started to start from <unk> .
And <unk> and other exciting things .
You know , they &apos;re <unk> .
So I started <unk> .
I did the first part of the <unk> of Beethoven .
As I did .
I think a very powerful way .
in the Augen of <unk> .
So , what if that &apos;s what happens when you have a living person .
<unk> , for a chemical , I mean ...
The Katalysator .
The <unk> of <unk> ...
in a way .
In quiet Neugier and <unk> .
As a result , in a way , what do you set up on the turn of the place .
And so on the <unk> .

We started to talk about the <unk> .
in Beethoven , <unk> ...
<unk> , all of the <unk> .
From <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
I think , in the way , I didn &apos;t believe it .
<unk> musikalisches <unk> ...
You know , that &apos;s the <unk> of the Musik .

You know , of the thing that they &apos;re doing is they have an <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> .
<unk> and Kreativität ...
in Wirklichkeit .
And so <unk> .

I think , in the world , the great art .
Now , this is the reason that we have to do things .
I mean , in all of the time , in all the time , it &apos;s ...
<unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> .
And that &apos;s the <unk> Linse .
In fact , in the <unk> , the physical interest in real time .
The <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> , and <unk> .

She &apos;s going to get a <unk> of a <unk> .
The <unk> thing of Musik , which is <unk> .
in einer Familie of Musiker ...
They look at it .
I mean , the <unk> .
And he <unk> .
I always wanted to get to play with <unk> .
You know , in Walt Disney , <unk> Hall is ...
<unk> on the street .
I have to become <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thanks .
Robert <unk> .
I &apos;m going to play a <unk> , I <unk> <unk> .
<unk> me .
I &apos;m Jane <unk> . I &apos;m a <unk> .
And for 10 years , I <unk> , I <unk> .
And my <unk> , I think , for the next decade , it &apos;s very easy to get to the world in real life , so that &apos;s in real life in real time .
You know , I &apos;ve got to show you a <unk> , and that &apos;s , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , more time , more time , more time , more time .
In this moment , in this day , we spend three billion hours every day online .
I think , well , I think , &quot; Well , that &apos;s a lot of time to play . &quot;
Even too much , but in fact , in the real world , in the real world , people have to deal with .
But in fact , I think , I think , well , I think , I think of the Institute for the Institute for the <unk> , which is that <unk> .
Three billion days , for three days , for the last days , for the world , for the world , <unk> Problemen .
See , I think , I think , when you have the nächstes Jahrhundert in this planet , you know , when you &apos;re in this planet , that &apos;s a huge amount of magnitude .
I mean , I &apos;ve been able to get out of it as far as we have to have 21 billion long hours in our days .
Now , I think , I think , I think , I &apos;m very bizarre , like , I think I &apos;m going to <unk> .
Now , as you can understand , as you can understand , as poor , Klimawandel , global , global , believe , I believe , I can ask , can we get to <unk> , currently , to bring up at the end of next 10 billion days , and I don &apos;t believe it .
Now , this is the talk . This is a very good one , very good , very good , very good at the same way of living in the future .
This is a Portrait of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , there &apos;s a lot of the conversation going on .
And so , there &apos;s a match for the Spieler , as they played .
And this is a very weak thing to play .
Now , when you don &apos;t have to be <unk> , I think , well , I don &apos;t have to tell an image .
And so , the kind of <unk> , you know , the <unk> , but <unk> , but most of all , you know , <unk> Konzentration , but <unk> Konzentration , very schwieriges , very schwieriges <unk> .
And when you have a <unk> , you know , here &apos;s a couple of feinen <unk> : the <unk> , the <unk> , and <unk> , are <unk> .
And then you know , we have a Zeichen of a lot of Überraschung .
This is a <unk> thing that says , &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
Ah , I know . Okay , well .
So here &apos;s a couple of <unk> .
Now , you know , you know , &quot; <unk> , &quot; is a <unk> , which is so unglaublich positiv , that they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing .
And I didn &apos;t stand up .
And when they &apos;re out there , they seem to be surprised to see , that &apos;s a <unk> .
This is a <unk> thing in the way that you can get a <unk> <unk> .
And so this is the thing that we have to do in the <unk> of all of the world &apos;s <unk> , but in fact , in all of the world &apos;s all of the time in the same shape .
The thing about the person , for all the time , all the time , in all the time , can get a <unk> <unk> .
But I don &apos;t have to look at this thing in the middle of the day , but I think we have an <unk> Problemen .
This is , I think , &quot; I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> , I don &apos;t have to be <unk> . &quot;
And that &apos;s what I did in it , right ? Yeah . Good .
I mean , I mean , I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> , I don &apos;t have to be <unk> .
This is a very short Graffiti in my field in Berkeley , California , where I am taking my Doktortitel in , which is , in fact , in the real time , in the real life .
And that &apos;s a lot of Spielern .
So , you know , that &apos;s not true in the real way that we &apos;re in real life , as we &apos;re in real time .
And I don &apos;t believe in a very good way , but it &apos;s a <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , it &apos;s <unk> . But I mean , but I mean , but I mean , but I mean , but I mean , but I mean , I mean , I mean , I &apos;m going to get up to the <unk> .
And in fact , when you &apos;re in a <unk> , I think , I think , the meisten of us have the greatest charge of the <unk> , to be very <unk> .
And so the most important thing to do as long as they have , for a minute , will be <unk> , so that <unk> .
And as in the real time , in the real life , in the real life , when you are , we don &apos;t have to be very much .
We &apos;re in love . We &apos;re <unk> .
And so we can feel <unk> , kind of , kind of , <unk> , <unk> .
We don &apos;t have the design of the real time .
They don &apos;t have to work in real time .
So that &apos;s what I used to study when I was looking at a <unk> .
And part of the exercise , you know , aren &apos;t you , so if you can &apos;t do anything ?
So , why can we engage the point of exercise , and they &apos;re in the real world ?
So I &apos;m going to play , I &apos;m going to play , I &apos;m going to play a World of Warcraft , which is real <unk> , that really , really , really <unk> <unk> .
And I started to get a bunch of things in the <unk> way in the <unk> .
The thing that I did at the moment is that every time ever , the online world , especially World of Warcraft , and most of the World of Warcraft , in fact , in fact , he &apos;s a lot of specific Charaktere in the day , right ?
But there &apos;s no <unk> , which has a <unk> effect on the <unk> . Right ?
And so they can do .
They don &apos;t give up a minute that they don &apos;t show up .
But there &apos;s an amazing thing to ever be . And so much .
But it &apos;s no Arbeitslosigkeit in World of Warcraft .
They don &apos;t have to be <unk> .
And it &apos;s a very <unk> and dangerous thing that has been <unk> .
And he &apos;s very much <unk> .
Every step , where you &apos;re going to be <unk> , is that , you know , the number of thousands of people , can ever get to the <unk> Mission <unk> .
This is something that &apos;s very difficult to do in the real life , so that , in fact , in the very end , very much better .
And you know , he &apos;s a <unk> Story , which is <unk> Geschichte , that you know , this is what you &apos;re doing here , why you &apos;re here .
And then , you know , all of positive Rückmeldungen , I can do .
You know , you know , you know , you know , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> Intelligenz .
Now , that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s not possible in the real life .
Now , when I &apos;m here in the <unk> , I don &apos;t have to get out of <unk> , I don &apos;t have to get on <unk> , silly , crazy simple .
And I mean , I don &apos;t have any kind of <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> living in the world , as World of Warcraft , that &apos;s the <unk> , where you have a lot of time in the middle of the <unk> , so that you know , all of the time in all of the <unk> , you know , all of our time , so that day all day .
It &apos;s kind of like the real thing .
Now , there &apos;s a World of <unk> World Trade Organization , and I have to bring up all of them in <unk> Millionen years of <unk> .
You know , that &apos;s not enough either .
And I think it &apos;s kind of irrelevant .
And so , for a minute , that &apos;s pretty obvious : <unk> , for the last week , the <unk> <unk> .
This is what the <unk> Primat .
Okay , as well as we can talk about the amount of time that we &apos;re living in the <unk> , the same way that it &apos;s going to be true , but in the same way , to think about the <unk> of the menschlichen Evolution , it &apos;s <unk> .
But it &apos;s true . Because it &apos;s true . Because it &apos;s true that , in fact , in a lot of the time , we have a lot of time to live , and in a way , where , in fact , in the way , in fact , in the way , where people are in .
So , we &apos;re in ways to be in ways that are <unk> and <unk> .
This is true . I think .
So , think about this interesting thing .
This is a picture of the Carnegie Mellon University of Carnegie Mellon .
In fact , the average young person in a world , in a very <unk> business , has 10,000 days in <unk> , for 10,000 days , for the day , 21 years old .
Well , 10,000 days ago , it &apos;s a very interesting role for two .
One , for the first place in the United States , is <unk> Stunden in the United States , for the very last few days , that ever , the <unk> amount of time in the morning , ever in the morning .
And so we have a very <unk> <unk> , where kids are very much more interested in having a lot of life in the classroom as well .
Now , for some of you guys , I think about this <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
So I think they &apos;re probably supposed to be <unk> , 10,000 days .
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s for us to live 10 long long ago , that if you can <unk> for 10 long long years old , for the fact that , in fact , that was possible .
In fact , I &apos;d love to be very good at the way of the world .
And so , you know , you know , there &apos;s a whole Generation of <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
And so the big question is , &quot; Where are Spielern <unk> ? &quot;
Because when they can come out , we would be able to do a very appropriate person an incredibly <unk> person .
This is the number of people who are now able to play in the world at a moment of online , and every day online .
This is <unk> .
In fact , 500 million people are very good at the same .
And in that , in the end , in the end , in the end , in the end , you have a billion Spielern , and in a <unk> , very good .
When you didn &apos;t know that .
In fact , the <unk> is <unk> , which has a lot of power to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> Internet can work in from the world , especially in China , and in fact , online , online .
And they &apos;re thinking more about it , <unk> , <unk> .
This is a 1.5 billion Spielern .
And so I wonder , in the way , in the way , in the same way , in fact , in this way , the <unk> .
I have four things . This is <unk> <unk> .
Okay . This is a extreme <unk> .
<unk> Optimismus can be <unk> , and they &apos;re a <unk> , and they &apos;re very <unk> , and they &apos;re very <unk> , and they &apos;re very <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , when you &apos;re <unk> , can get <unk> , and so it &apos;s <unk> , and now it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
In fact , there &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And he &apos;s a lot of interesting research , but in fact , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , but we have to play a conversation with them , and they &apos;re all <unk> .
The talk is , you know , the <unk> can get to play .
And so , in fact , when they have a while , that &apos;s where they live in the time , that they have , they thought , well , they &apos;re going to work in the same way , that they &apos;re all <unk> , and they &apos;re all <unk> .
So one of the Spiele is working on the <unk> , so the <unk> , and the <unk> .
And as a result , there &apos;s a lot of rich social Beziehungen .
<unk> . Very good .
You know , he &apos;s talking a lot of the World Trade of World War II 22 days pro Woche , fast as an <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s because of the time , when you know , when you &apos;re having a conversation , it &apos;s really glücklicher enough , so much more than anything in the way that it &apos;s <unk> .
And so we know that , as a way , as a people , they &apos;re being made by harter , working for them .
And Spieler are gewillt of people to work for a lot of the time .
And finally , <unk> .
And so I &apos;m going to be very passionate about <unk> Missionen , to be a <unk> <unk> .
And so , a small <unk> , that <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , Wikipedia , that &apos;s the biggest <unk> <unk> .
The zweite biggest <unk> <unk> , in fast 80,000 Artikeln , is the World Trade Organization <unk> .
Five Millionen people use them every Monat .
In fact , more <unk> from World of Warcraft , from the World Trade of Warcraft , in every other person in the Internet .
They &apos;re <unk> .
They &apos;re a <unk> <unk> of World of Warcraft on World of Warcraft .
Okay , so that &apos;s four <unk> that has been in one shot .
<unk> are <unk> , <unk> .
These are people who think they &apos;re <unk> in the world , they live in the world .
And the problem is that they have to see if they &apos;re in the same world , they don &apos;t have to change the real world .
I mean , this is a problem that I versuche .
He &apos;s a Ökonom , Edward <unk> .
It &apos;s brilliant . There &apos;s a lot of time . It &apos;s a lot of time for the reason why people have so much time and a lot of time for <unk> .
And er said , &quot; You know , you know , we &apos;re not a very <unk> lot of a huge amount of information in virtuelle Welten and <unk> . &quot;
And there &apos;s a <unk> , so it &apos;s rational .
And so , you know , you know , I &apos;m a <unk> , I &apos;m a <unk> . I &apos;m <unk> .
But , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s perfectly logical , right , can be <unk> in a <unk> world in the real world .
In fact , in the real world , in the real world , in real time in real life .
And they can do a lot of social Feedback , and they &apos;re very <unk> in real terms .
And so , you know , you know , that &apos;s perfect logical , that means that Spielern is more time in virtuelle Welten in virtuelle Welten as in real world .
So , I mean , I mean , I mean , that &apos;s rational .
But there &apos;s no optimal situation .
We have to have the real world in a long way .
And so I kind of like my Inspiration from anything else in the <unk> .
This is ancient Würfel , made out of <unk> . Okay ?
And for cool , very cool , very <unk> .
And these are the very <unk> Tool for the <unk> , which is <unk> .
And as you know , the new griechischen Historiker <unk> , you know , the <unk> <unk> , you know , the <unk> .
Those Erfinder des <unk> , and why they &apos;re <unk> .
In fact , <unk> , especially the <unk> , but in the <unk> , in the <unk> , they were <unk> in <unk> .
And so , as you know , what you really saw , you know , is that König of <unk> entschied , that <unk> entschied , etwas <unk> .
<unk> . People <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s a very extreme situation . They have a extreme kind of hands .
And so they said , well , <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
One day , one day , one .
Am nächsten Tag , after all , working together .
And they kind of <unk> in their games , so it &apos;s kind of so exciting , and so it &apos;s kind of so interesting , and so it &apos;s kind of <unk> in their <unk> , so that they don &apos;t have to control it .
And am nächsten , they kind of play Spiele .
And then , after the day , they cook .
And I think they were all 18 years old .
And so they decided to stay in the one day , and am nächsten Tag , and am nächsten Tag .
Now , I think , well , this is exactly what we &apos;re doing today .
We &apos;re going to create Spiele , and they &apos;re going to be able to create a real world .
We &apos;re using them to <unk> all of the changes in the real world , everything in the real world , all of the things that aren &apos;t touched at the real life , and that &apos;s because of the real life .
But there &apos;s no <unk> .
This is very exciting .
In fact , in 18 years , we don &apos;t have a better place .
And so in this , the head of the head , they kind of <unk> out there .
So they were going to be very <unk> .
And they kind of played a <unk> , and the Gewinner of the conversation in a <unk> .
They were <unk> , and then they come in a <unk> , and then in a <unk> .
All of a sudden , we were going to be able to survive in the <unk> , and I can <unk> , and hoffentlich , they can live in the way that they live in different ways .
Now , that &apos;s kind of weird , right ?
But in letzter of a sudden , the <unk> showed that the <unk> , which would suffer in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> DNA , as well .
And so there &apos;s a couple of interesting things that are <unk> , which is crazy .
And Geologen are <unk> for granted that 20 Jahre later , in the 20 days , which seems to be missing in 20 years .
Now , kind of kind of like this , where you can do this .
So , you know , they &apos;re going to be able to get back in the way that they were going to be able to live in a conversation for 18 , and they &apos;re going to be on 18 , and so on and so on , and so on and so on , and so on , so much in the world , they &apos;re going to be able to live in the way they care .
Okay , so we can .
We ’ ve been working World of Warcraft .
This is what the <unk> <unk> of World Trade of World <unk> . This is what &apos;s <unk> .
In fact , they play in 18 , and I ’ ve been working in <unk> , and in 16 .
I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll be ready for our own <unk> .
Well , they were allowed to have helped people live in a different way in a different world .
This is where I &apos;m going to spend my next <unk> <unk> in my day .
So , the number of all , you know , is that , for a minute , for a minute , for a minute , for a minute , for a minute , we &apos;re going to have a <unk> in the real world .
I mean , I know , I said , &quot; You know , well , you know , &quot; Well , well , you know , I &apos;m going to have the difficulty of working ? &quot; Well , that &apos;s where I am honored to be in the last few years , and I am honored to be an <unk> .
In fact , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the same way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the way that we have to be able to do in the future .
We don &apos;t want to do it .
You know , we &apos;re <unk> .
And so we can think of the best way .
And then , you know , we can give them a lot of people to get the real situation .
You know , we &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and then we give them a <unk> , and then we give them a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m just going to give you a little bit back , I &apos;m going to show you a lot of the time that I made a lot of people , to give them a lot of people , to get their own <unk> , in Zukunft .
Okay , so that &apos;s the World Wide <unk> .
In 2007 , in 2007 .
This is a <unk> , in a <unk> , in a <unk> .
In fact , it &apos;s <unk> , but now , but we can put it in online ways , where it &apos;s <unk> , so that it &apos;s real , and , you know , you can live , and , you know , if you don &apos;t have to be an <unk> . So , as soon as you start , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , right ?
And now , let &apos;s give back to <unk> and data , which is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is not like the <unk> <unk> , which is not like the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , so that <unk> , so that <unk> .
And you know , you know , the real life way , if you have a real life , so if that &apos;s what was happening . And then , to be a blog , and then he &apos;s asking to be a Blog , to post the <unk> and <unk> .
And so we started <unk> with <unk> Spielern .
And then , for the last few years , for the three years .
And I can tell you that this is a <unk> Erlebnis .
No one will have any kind of <unk> , but it &apos;s very good for the world , because it &apos;s good for the world .
But when they put them in a <unk> , they said , &quot; You know , we don &apos;t have to be <unk> . &quot;
This is a fantastic story , and it &apos;s a fantastic story .
So , look out , you know , you know , you know , you can live .
In fact , the most important thing that they did is they kind of <unk> in this conversation .
And so for the nächste <unk> , you know , <unk> , you know , you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And so we started a Spiel called <unk> , which <unk> .
And the <unk> thing that looks like that , you know , can be <unk> , the only way to put it in the world .
Now , the kind of Supercomputer that <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we were asking people to get online , fast as an Jerry <unk> film .
You know , the Jerry <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
The <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and they have to <unk> the world .
But in the end , but in the end of five people in the <unk> , every one in the <unk> , and it &apos;s your Job , and your job , you know , the future of <unk> , the future of <unk> , Zukunft of future , Zukunft of future , Zukunft of future .
We took 8,000 people to play in eight minutes .
In fact , they &apos;re <unk> in the very few hundreds of thousands of kreative Lösungen , which are <unk> .
And then , as soon as we put it on three , we put them on three März . This Spiel is built in the World Bank Bank .
And when they <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> by the World Bank Bank , which is a <unk> World Bank , at the same time .
We have an <unk> to <unk> across very <unk> Africa , and we &apos;re putting them out of the <unk> Innovation .
We have a <unk> . We have a <unk> . We have a <unk> with the kind of vision , right , thank you , God , Vision , Vision and <unk> .
And so I &apos;m going to encourage you to build all this , and I &apos;m going to share with you , to be able to share , in the world , especially in the middle of the world , but in <unk> , who can <unk> them , and they &apos;re going to be able to get them to live in the world .
So I &apos;m going to get out there .
I &apos;m going to ask you a question .
Now , how do you think ?
All of the great Spieler , you know , are all of the things that we &apos;re dealing with , but I have to do this , but no one &apos;s going to be the real world .
Well , I hope I have a lot of , I think , can be a human Ressource , that can be <unk> , you know , the real world , you know , in the real world , that &apos;s a dangerous <unk> .
We have all the very <unk> <unk> , <unk> Produktivität , which gives you a dense , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> Optimismus , so that <unk> can be <unk> .
I mean , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , can live , Spiele to the <unk> , to be able to <unk> , to live in the world .
And I mean , I mean , I &apos;m going to carry on with it , and they &apos;re going to play , and they &apos;re going to play in this way .
And when I come back in the end , I think I &apos;m going to have two things in that , I can ask for two things , I think , I can relate to the future , and I can play every game that you might be .
So I said , well , I can start <unk> .
Thank you .
In fact , I &apos;m going to be interested in the <unk> .
Now , that might seem to be seltsam for a long time , but in the same way , as well as the same as I thought , well , it &apos;s very , very <unk> , so that it &apos;s very common , so that it &apos;s very common , so that it &apos;s true . &quot;
Just as , the person in the trouble thinks that was somebody who &apos;s <unk> different <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
For the kind of Schmerz , for example , as an individual , you know , as an <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
One thing that &apos;s wrong is , right , it &apos;s real , it &apos;s a <unk> .
Um sicherzustellen , that &apos;s a very simple <unk> , I &apos;m going to start a very simple <unk> <unk> .
And so I &apos;m going to show you , you know , this thing .
I mean , I was looking out as a little kid in the <unk> <unk> in den 1970ern .
I want to do this thing , I &apos;m going to get them .
And then , I &apos;m going to tell you why I turn on .
This is the way .
You know , the thing that you can see is that I can see my way .
So I &apos;m going to put on that way in my way I have to hold on in my way .
I got my Ärmel <unk> .
And so he , in fact , he can &apos;t get from the place in any Ärmel , I &apos;m making it in my <unk> .
So that &apos;s the way that it &apos;s no moving way .
And so I kind of <unk> here , and I don &apos;t have to come in and out in my Ärmel .
It &apos;s very simple .
So I do my <unk> , and I hoffentlich , as well , as good , my Magnetismus , my Magnetismus , so I can do it .
You know , the <unk> <unk> , that I can play , and I can play , and I don &apos;t have fallen on the ground .
I don &apos;t have to be in from the Ärmel , no <unk> . And they can do everything .
<unk> !
The thing that &apos;s when I get interested in the way is , I &apos;m going to be interested in the <unk> of <unk> , because man can get much more interested in Täuschung .
All of the things very simple .
Most of the time you know , you know , you know ?
This is the way .
I &apos;m very sorry in my way .
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to get my <unk> <unk> , that I can &apos;t come up in and out of my Ärmel .
That is .
I mean , I mean , I &apos;m going to get my <unk> <unk> , because there &apos;s this secret of Illusion .
I mean , in the minute that my computer <unk> , I get my fingers in the way that &apos;s in the world , in a way , in one , in a while .
<unk> . One of the things that didn &apos;t have to do in the room is in the room .
So that &apos;s how .
And when I get out , I get my Finger .
Wir können darüber reden , warum , so I can &apos;t tell you , why is it that he doesn &apos;t realize it , but I can &apos;t tell you anything .
This is , because the way that the brain works in a way is that , in a way , two , three , three , but <unk> .
But that &apos;s not true , right ? And I don &apos;t have to do it .
Now , you know , there &apos;s no <unk> here in the <unk> , but I know of Täuschung , I know of Täuschung .
And , as I came out , I did .
And as I &apos;m going to get back to the <unk> , I &apos;m going to get my fingers out , I can <unk> my lunch .
So I &apos;m going to get out of the way . We have the <unk> .
One of the great things that they can do for Freunden and Familienmitglieder .
Now , do you think about it ?
I was reading a couple of years ago , I was reading a lot of my mind on the left .
I don &apos;t have to be a special , I mean , for myself , that &apos;s very amazing .
So , in fact , when they take a Placebo , in the shape of a weißen , which seems to be a <unk> , that &apos;s a <unk> .
<unk> as the shape of the <unk> , for the smaller Pille , to the smaller Pille , the <unk> , and where they get a positive , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , in fact , without both using both of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> .
But a weißen driver is not as good as a <unk> .
What ? I mean , really , really , right ?
But in addition to that , the <unk> .
And in fact , in fact , that means that there &apos;s more wirksamer to the <unk> .
Eine farbige Kapsel , gelb in the one and rot , and , in the other hand , more than a weißen .
<unk> spielt a Rolle .
A solar cell has zweimal so far less than three <unk> , I don &apos;t have to get to you , sorry .
But that was ...
<unk> play .
And there &apos;s a shape .
And for the ultimativen <unk> , we have in the Nadel .
Yeah , yes , right ? One of the <unk> , a couple of <unk> , a couple of <unk> in a <unk> , that was in a person in a <unk> .
This is a huge fluid in his mind .
So , you know , it &apos;s more attractive to the weißen Pille .
Let &apos;s be able to get back in the same way , when you &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s not true that the weißen Pille are not as good as the <unk> , which is not as gut as the plates , not as well as the Nadel .
And none of all of you have a real <unk> .
Only the person &apos;s the real thing inside the Körpers , and you &apos;re <unk> .
I wollte , in a way , I wanted to show the Idee in a <unk> .
You know , I want to do it with a very simple thing , and it &apos;s real .
We know about the fact that this is where the real world was possible , in the Nadel .
This is a clip of 18 Zentimeter . They &apos;re <unk> .
So I got a little bit <unk> here .
This is my <unk> . This is not very easy to do it .
This is my <unk> . This is not <unk> .
I <unk> my <unk> , and I have to put my calculation in my place in my arm , dead , dead .
As a matter of fact , as a simple man , or as a simple man , I took this thing to do for a couple of little Freunde , and I did this for a couple of people I didn &apos;t know .
One of the Middle Ages were taken out .
So I can ask for that as a <unk> , that was when you know , when you know , you know , the <unk> , I thought , well , I &apos;ve got the <unk> .
You know , but you know , but <unk> , as ever .
This is the way .
<unk> , I have a small Loch .
Sorry , do you . Can you do this ?
And then , I &apos;ll have a little <unk> , and then on the other hand , in the other hand .
Now , in the way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way .
So a kind of .
You know , but I have all my Fingern , right ?
I &apos;ll be here . Here &apos;s one , two , three , four , five , five .
Yeah ...
I think the way they think about it .
They thought , &quot; Well , there &apos;s no <unk> genug , so far , for a couple of minutes , for a couple of minutes , I &apos;ll give you a <unk> .
So , you know , that &apos;s true ? Very good .
Yeah , I know . The other thing in the room saying , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t mean real . &quot; So I don &apos;t really believe . People in the other hand , right ?
So let me show you that in the way .
This is my <unk> . This is not <unk> .
This is my <unk> . I can do the pin .
Sorry . Wenn es dir too much <unk> , and not in that thing .
In the other hand , in the other people , in fact , in the way , at the point of view , people say , &quot; Well , that &apos;s a very <unk> effect , but if it &apos;s a very <unk> effect , but if it &apos;s what , he &apos;s here , and he , as an object , will do . &quot;
Yeah , so he .
I used to be able to get the lasers out .
I &apos;m going to open my poor Arm , and I think he &apos;s no <unk> .
But in the context of etwas , and in the sense of the person , the real thing that they &apos;re wrong with , and really , really , really , really , I &apos;m going to get the Nadel out , and I &apos;m going to get out of the <unk> .
In the last few days , I &apos;ll be very <unk> .
So I &apos;ll be aware of that . Even here .
I know very much in my life .
I have just two gehalten .
The thing that you see , you know , is to be a leidenschaftliche <unk> .
It &apos;s a nice <unk> , <unk> , good <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
This was a <unk> .
Well , for the first time , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
And so this was how to make it very gut .
I had a very poor person in a couple of months .
One day , that was a place called <unk> , and I asked to ask , or I asked , &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to you at a moment of the <unk> .
&quot; <unk> &quot; , I said .
And here , this is a giant fund that has taken a lot of stuff , which has a huge problem for <unk> .
So , why can we be on the menu ?
In the last 50 years , in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been <unk> , as we did <unk> .
It &apos;s very schwierig to <unk> .
90 percent of the big fischen , that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to be on , the Thunfische , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s about fast nichts .
So , as well as good , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And as far as he &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
<unk> waste , the meisten of them are likely to be serious .
<unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
This means that he would need to get a <unk> black <unk> <unk> , to a <unk> <unk> .
Not very <unk> .
And it &apos;s not very good .
And so here , as soon as a company , that &apos;s a lot of a lot of stuff .
I &apos;m going to support them .
The day for the Veranstaltung , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> .
Let &apos;s give them no way .
&quot; Don &apos;t ask , &quot; I said , &quot; Well , I know , &quot; I mean , &quot; Look , I can &apos;t <unk> the way in any way so much in <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Well , it &apos;s true , &quot; said , &quot; Well , we &apos;re so weit out of the Küste , that &apos;s because of the way that it &apos;s <unk> , and not <unk> . &quot;
And so , in fact , , &quot; We &apos;re a <unk> .
The <unk> ? One , two to 1 , says , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
One of the ones to one , do great .
&quot; One of the things that was ? One was ? &quot;
<unk> Proteine , &quot; <unk> Proteine &quot; .
&quot; <unk> &quot; , I said . And I did .
And in the middle , I was stuck in Bett , and I thought , well , it &apos;s a <unk> protein ?
And so I am very , very recently , very recently , very recently .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t know what &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
Er said that , you know , er didn &apos;t know . It &apos;s <unk> .
And so I &apos;ve been able to do a couple of people in the United States .
No one can give me a clear answer .
Well , I &apos;ll give you an answer that I came out of the <unk> .
Let &apos;s give them a <unk> .
&quot; Don ’ t &quot; , I said , &quot; What are some examples of <unk> Proteine ? &quot;
Well , you know , you know , you know , some <unk> , and a couple of <unk> , and then <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
We said , &quot; Yeah , so that , you know , Federn , Haut , <unk> , <unk> Knochen , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; What percentage of the <unk> was Huhn ? &quot;
<unk> , <unk> .
&quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent . &quot;
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t , well , what does he do an <unk> ? &quot;
He &apos;s a long evening out of the line , and er said , &quot; He &apos;s a lot of Huhn in the world . &quot;
My love to the <unk> .
Not , but I don &apos;t have to be a <unk> , <unk> .
I mean .
No , I ’ ve lost my love to the <unk> , I ’ ve <unk> it , and I ’ ve <unk> the <unk> , the Fisch in Huhn .
And this zweite Fisch , which is a very different <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s the romantic way , so the way you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to look at it in a very short place in <unk> .
Now , for example , <unk> Journalist , for all of you , is for all of the <unk> .
In fact , it &apos;s kind of <unk> .
And so on , there &apos;s a hell of a hell of a hell of beautiful , tiny , weißen shape .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
Fast zweimal .
<unk> very much .
How do you have a lot of good thinking about that , for a lot of time , after <unk> ?
I don &apos;t have to , but you know .
Let &apos;s give them Miguel .
In fact , there &apos;s a big <unk> .
And nein , you didn &apos;t buy the <unk> .
Right now , so on the way , as you and I can understand .
There &apos;s an <unk> in <unk> La <unk> .
This is a <unk> in the <unk> of Spanien .
In the middle of the <unk> .
In fact , in the 1980ern , the <unk> of <unk> .
They were <unk> at the same way in which actually .
They took it out of the country .
They built a complicated <unk> , and they &apos;re using the water in the field of the site .
They don &apos;t mean them , but they didn &apos;t .
And so , as you see , what was it ?
90 percent of the Vögel went down .
In fact , this is a lot of Voegel .
And so on , at a <unk> restaurant , at a <unk> restaurant , the site is cooked .
What did they do ?
We &apos;re <unk> the <unk> .
They literally get the wheels .
At the same time , instead of using water , they used to use the wing , and then they got to get back in the water .
We put these Kanäle in the water .
In fact , they set up a 1,100 2,000 Hektar <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , corn , <unk> , <unk> -- and that &apos;s where , and for the right , there &apos;s no supply chain , right .
The <unk> is great .
I mean , you know , that &apos;s what you didn &apos;t notice before .
We have an <unk> long way , which is far away , and all of the sudden <unk> , and all of the sudden , very small , low temperature .
I don &apos;t plan for a long way , which I do in Miguel .
There &apos;s a huge sample , three Darwin Charles Darwin and a <unk> <unk> .
OK ? Because there are <unk> in the <unk> , I <unk> , and I <unk> , <unk> , Schlamm in my Knie , and Miguel <unk> .
In fact , there &apos;s a seltenen <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s an <unk> of the <unk> .
And here , here , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> , that &apos;s an <unk> , thinking .
And so , in fact , there &apos;s a lot of the <unk> in the last few years in the <unk> National Park in Africa .
I was asking you , what was so <unk> ?
Er said , &quot; <unk> ? I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot;
And then , you know , you know , you know , so much of the seltenen Vögeln and <unk> , <unk> .
I don &apos;t have to get wrong , it &apos;s very faszinierend , it &apos;s really faszinierend .
And it &apos;s very amazing , but I love myself .
And in my place , my <unk> , I think , in the <unk> , I had to give you an hour .
So I &apos;m going to give you it . I said , &quot; Miguel , where does the mean that your Fisch was so good ? &quot;
The thing about the <unk> .
&quot; I know , you know , you know , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
But was there ?
What &apos;s the <unk> ? &quot;
And then , you know , there &apos;s a lot of my <unk> System , so that it &apos;s a very <unk> System , that was the <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> Plankton , that &apos;s the <unk> Plankton .
And so it &apos;s as good , it &apos;s very healthy .
It &apos;s no <unk> .
One is about a farm that has no way of working .
<unk> , I &apos;m going to talk to you , I &apos;m talking about Miguel , and I asked , &quot; Well , I said , I said , &quot; Well , I think , &quot; Well , I think , &quot; Well , I think , &quot; Well , I think , &quot; Well , that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing ? &quot;
In fact , what happens is that , as if , as if , as an <unk> , the <unk> .
And we went to the corner , and we looked at the very right way , and we looked at the very <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , literally , <unk> Teppich , right ?
&quot; This is a <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Look at the <unk> , pink . &quot;
They &apos;re a <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? I &apos;m very <unk> .
I said , &quot; Miguel , they don &apos;t have to be on the Party ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah ! &quot; , &quot; Yeah . &quot; , said .
&quot; We &apos;re going to spend 20 percent of the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
In the last few years , there &apos;s 600.000 trees , more than 250 .
You know , it &apos;s the biggest and one of the most <unk> private life has become in Europe . &quot;
I said , &quot; Miguel , it &apos;s a <unk> , who doesn &apos;t have any good at all , can &apos;t be the last person ? &quot;
So , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
Er said , &quot; Well , we don &apos;t <unk> .
This is a <unk> Netzwerk .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> essen .
The fishermen are <unk> .
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , the <unk> . &quot;
OK , let &apos;s see here .
One of the things that they don &apos;t have to do , is that they don &apos;t have to do it , and a <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> .
<unk> , but <unk> .
Oh , oh , well , the <unk> , that would have to be completely unable to get there .
We put in a building in a building 250 miles , where the <unk> are better at the <unk> .
Every morning , they live 250 miles an <unk> .
And every one night we &apos;re going to get 250 miles back .
They &apos;re doing it , because they can <unk> the computational weißen point of the <unk> .
I &apos;m sorry .
I was looking a <unk> , so I kind of like , I &apos;ll be a <unk> .
I said , &quot; Miguel , we &apos;re going to <unk> 250 miles an <unk> , and then , at the time , 250 miles ?
Is it possible for the <unk> ? &quot;
So , there &apos;s a way of thinking about the Whitney <unk> .
Er said , &quot; No . They &apos;re doing it , but they &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
I don &apos;t have to have the control of my silly Fisch , I don &apos;t have to mention that , and I &apos;m not sure .
I don &apos;t have to do it . I don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> Geschmack .
I don &apos;t care very much .
But when I ran out in this Restaurant , in the middle , you don &apos;t have to <unk> .
It makes up Süßes , so if they &apos;re so much , so if they took a <unk> out of the <unk> .
I said , well , I &apos;m talking to Miguel and <unk> .
We said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s a <unk> .
It &apos;s the last thing that has a place in the air out there .
The thing about the <unk> is <unk> . &quot;
And then , &quot; But there &apos;s no <unk> . &quot;
OK . There &apos;s no <unk> .
One of the things that we have , you know , is that we have a <unk> .
And then , when you had , when you said , you know , you know , <unk> that didn &apos;t have a <unk> , you know , that &apos;s a giant <unk> , because the water that <unk> from the <unk> Fluss .
This is a <unk> that contains all of you , you know , you know , the intersection of the world , you know , you know , growing up , chemical <unk> , <unk> .
And so , as you know , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , the water &apos;s <unk> , when it &apos;s <unk> .
And so it &apos;s as good as the water <unk> .
So not only do you not have a <unk> that &apos;s not working , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , which is a <unk> , but <unk> , which is <unk> .
And not only did the type of Fischen , but for you and I .
Because as an <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> .
In the middle , I don &apos;t know , but I think , but I think , but I have to do it , and that &apos;s what the <unk> , but the <unk> , are <unk> .
The way they &apos;re saying is that it &apos;s a Rezept for good to be good , or , you know , <unk> or <unk> .
You know , that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which has a <unk> <unk> , one where it &apos;s very good .
But for a lot of people , it &apos;s a small one .
We don &apos;t have to be <unk> , <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> .
We &apos;re kind of like little <unk> .
We need to talk about regional food .
You know organic .
And , as you know , these things that are the people that might be good enough , but it &apos;s always possible to give them a person , and he said , &quot; Hey , you know , I &apos;m kind of <unk> <unk> , but , &quot; Hey , I &apos;m special to do <unk> .
How do you feed the world ? &quot;
I mean , I &apos;m sorry ?
I don &apos;t have to ask the question .
No , not because of all of us , you know , we &apos;re now capable of <unk> to feed the world .
One billion people are <unk> .
One billion -- that &apos;s more than you -- but for the huge Ungleichheit in the lower colony , not the amount .
I don &apos;t have to have all of this question , because they &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> of all 50 years .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , Pestizide to <unk> , nuclear energy waste an <unk> , Huhn and <unk> , and all the <unk> <unk> , and all the <unk> said , &quot; Well , can be <unk> . &quot;
That &apos;s the <unk> .
This is the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
We have to call it <unk> , which is a Unterfangen in <unk> , a Unterfangen that has <unk> to be very fragile <unk> , that the <unk> <unk> .
This is no <unk> , and it &apos;s no <unk> .
And now , every time you get home now , now , not by <unk> <unk> , but <unk> <unk> , not by <unk> <unk> , but in <unk> , but in <unk> , but in <unk> , they don &apos;t have to use the <unk> , but in <unk> , and not by <unk> , but in <unk> , and not by <unk> , but in <unk> , and not <unk> .
Are you saving the world ?
Beginnen we with all of the question , which was <unk> ?
Or do you feel better , how can we live in places in order to feed each other ?
To do that , we don &apos;t have to <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> .
We have a huge amount of money , Chemikalien and <unk> , and it doesn &apos;t have to be very good to feed .
But now , in the right , we &apos;re in the <unk> .
This is the <unk> that &apos;s in two Milliarden years ago .
You know , when Miguel , <unk> , as Miguel , <unk> , which has no <unk> , <unk> , but in order to build <unk> , <unk> , but in order to scale up , we don &apos;t have to be special , but in fact , <unk> , but in fact , <unk> in Beziehungen , because they &apos;re the <unk> .
And as I really , really , really , really , I &apos;m very sorry , you &apos;re a <unk> .
You know , I think it &apos;s okay , but it &apos;s very good , because it &apos;s fine .
Vielen Dank .
I grew up in a permanent <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> , I went to the <unk> , and I went to a <unk> , and every day , every day .
And I used to take back from a <unk> , a Science Fiction , that I had in an <unk> of my life , and I in <unk> , in <unk> , and in <unk> , my <unk> Neugier .
And , you know , the Neugier <unk> , in the fact that I , when I don &apos;t , when I was in the room , I &apos;m in , in the Wald , <unk> , Frösche , Schlangen , so in the same way , Frösche , Schlangen , and <unk> , and they took a <unk> .
You know , I know , I &apos;m a real <unk> .
But all of the sudden , the world &apos;s all of the world &apos;s <unk> .
Und meine Liebe for Science , so I think , in the world , to me , will be <unk> in the world , so that what was the end of the <unk> , we went in den <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> , Jacques Cousteau , where he was looking at a fantastic <unk> , who was looking at the beauty of the world , and the <unk> world , die in all of the world , in fact , that were impossible .
So that &apos;s what we consider to be on the very interesting Science Fiction .
And I &apos;m a Künstlerin .
I can post . I can Malen .
And because he didn &apos;t have a <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> Filmen and all of the messages in the Medienlandschaft , I &apos;d like to make these messages in my place .
You know , that &apos;s all of us , as soon as a child , to write a <unk> , and at the end of the day , you know , at the end of the day , you know , at the end of the day , in the end of the day in the <unk> .
And I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , what do you do ?
I used to catch in <unk> <unk> <unk> from my <unk> .
So that &apos;s what the Kreativität of the <unk> .
And he looked very interesting , the Jacques Cousteau &apos;s <unk> , really , really , really , really , really surprised at the fact that he &apos;s a <unk> world .
I mean , I don &apos;t really believe in a <unk> world in an <unk> world .
This was very unwahrscheinlich .
But that &apos;s what a world where I can actually do in the world , where I &apos;m going to get on the ground here , the very complex and exotic and exotic , as well , that &apos;s what I did in the lesen about the Büchern .
And so I set out to be in 15 <unk> in 15 years .
And so that &apos;s a very difficult thing to do in which I lebte in a small Dorf in Canada , 600 million of the <unk> .
But I didn &apos;t get to <unk> .
I am an <unk> for a minute , as soon as an <unk> in Buffalo , New York City , in Buffalo , New York City , right ?
And I made a <unk> <unk> , in a giant <unk> , in the middle , in the <unk> , in Buffalo , New York .
And so I saw the Ozean , a real Ozean , not dead , but in fact , in the two years , in California .
In the <unk> 40 years , I have about 3,000 Stunden in the water , and 500 Stunden in the <unk> .
And I was looking at the ground , and in the middle , in the middle , in the middle , we have to live in the middle of the world as well as well , and so it &apos;s still true in life .
The reason for the nature of the way in the way is that , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , human imagination .
<unk> , I have a massive Ehrfurcht in my life , I have in this <unk> .
Und meine <unk> love to the <unk> love , which is pretty much so stark .
But as an event , as an art scientist , what &apos;s the <unk> .
And so , the best way , I think , the <unk> , I have to talk to the <unk> , to be able to raise the <unk> .
And as a whole thing , I think , the thing I did was to show the <unk> , etc .
In the film , what kind of the way they &apos;re doing war , can <unk> and <unk> .
And I know , the <unk> , I had to tell you Science Fiction , &quot; Terminator , &quot; -- &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; aliens . &quot;
And so , &quot; The <unk> &quot; , I made my love for the <unk> , and I can play in , to be able to do with film .
You know , the two Leidenschaften are <unk> .
In fact , this interesting thing about &quot; The <unk> &quot; , which means that , in a virtual <unk> , in the film , the <unk> <unk> in the movie , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And that &apos;s called a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , that you had to stand in a movie .
And in fact , in fact , that film didn &apos;t get a lot of money , but I didn &apos;t have to tell you what was I was doing in a very difficult thing , which is what I was doing in the world , which is what &apos;s called the <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s Arthur <unk> <unk> , so that every <unk> has no <unk> <unk> .
They looked at something magical .
And I got very enthusiastisch .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s a <unk> . &quot;
And so , in the way , &quot; <unk> 2 &quot; , which was my 2. Film , of course .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in the film . It &apos;s <unk> .
And so it took . And so , and so we started to <unk> .
And so we did the same thing in the world .
As a result , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
So , one of the things that they created , in the two aspects of mind , is that there &apos;s a whole new world , which has a whole new world of Kreativität in <unk> .
And so I started a company in Winston Vashem Winston , my guten Freund <unk> Winston Smith , such as the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , which was the <unk> <unk> .
And so on the ground , what if that was a <unk> , we &apos;d like to get down to the analog Prozessen in the visual institutions of visual institutions and so on .
And so that &apos;s what they did in , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
But in fact , but in fact , in the middle , in the middle , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , for the <unk> and the <unk> , for the right .
And so I said , &quot; Avatar , &quot; which said , &quot; Avatar , &quot; which has an idea of all the <unk> of the <unk> Effekte , <unk> Effekte , and in <unk> menschlichen emotionalen role in <unk> , and in <unk> , in <unk> , and in <unk> , and the world in <unk> , and <unk> .
And I said , I &apos;m going to tell you , in the United States , I don &apos;t have to be in the <unk> .
And so I set up in the <unk> , and I took the other film to be in a much larger Schiff .
I am verkaufte it on the Studio , as &quot; Romeo and <unk> &quot; .
This is a <unk> romantic , <unk> film .
And so I wanted to do what was I <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> in the real world .
And that &apos;s why I made the film .
And that &apos;s what the real thing about . This is not true .
But I kind of <unk> . I said , &quot; Well , I go in that <unk> . &quot;
We want to use them in the <unk> .
It &apos;s very wichtig . It &apos;s a great <unk> .
I got to sell to a <unk> .
Very important . But that &apos;s where you &apos;re looking at the legacy of the reason that you &apos;re doing real .
Because when you really see in the real world , when I saw in a very <unk> U-Boot in a Russian U-Boot , two and a half thousand , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the real Titanic , in the real Titanic , no <unk> , but real .
I mean , that &apos;s very amazing .
And there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> and <unk> and all sorts of things .
But that &apos;s a lot of me in the way that &apos;s very much in the dive , so I kind of kind of kind of kind of <unk> in the <unk> .
You know , the very low-tech thing here , the <unk> .
The one in the way that they have in this sort , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way in the Middle Eastern Umgebung , where he doesn &apos;t wake up .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , I think , &quot; Wow , so I ’ m living in an Science Fiction .
This is very cool .
And so I , you know , you know , I have a lot of <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> .
It &apos;s what it all . It &apos;s what &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s what it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s what I didn &apos;t care about .
Because , you know , I can feel a real thing , and I can see a <unk> effect on the <unk> . But I can &apos;t do anything . I can &apos;t fit , was I in the <unk> .
In fact , for the next few years , I saw people in the thousands of thousands of equipment , and I rather , I hadn &apos;t seen anything else that I had before , and I didn &apos;t even notice it , I hadn &apos;t seen anything in the world before , that were actually not known in the world .
And so what I did today , I have a lot of <unk> .
And so I set out for a very <unk> Entscheidung .
So , in the <unk> , I said , &quot; OK , I said , &quot; OK , I am making a <unk> as Hollywood <unk> , and I have a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And so we started to scale up .
And so we went on to the <unk> , and <unk> it mit <unk> .
We went to the <unk> der Titanic .
We took little <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> .
And so the thing that comes out in the war , in the way , in the <unk> , the <unk> , which didn &apos;t show up .
No one &apos;s going to be seen in the same way . We didn &apos;t have the time to do it , so that &apos;s not the <unk> . Also entwickelten we uns , also entwickelten Technologien .
So here , you know , I am here , am Deck of the Titanic , in a U-Boot , in a U-Boot , and I have an <unk> to the <unk> , which was a lot of the kind of thing that I did in this , where I knew that the Band spielte .
And I <unk> a small fan of the <unk> .
When I said , I &apos;m going to get to you , but I ’ m in my Bewusstsein , but I ’ ve got to see the <unk> in the <unk> der Titanic .
And so the most <unk> kind of <unk> that I had to do for you , because I had to stand in a corner , and I realized that , for the light , the <unk> , when I was in the <unk> , when I was an <unk> , when I were in the picture .
And the kind of thing as an image on the <unk> is <unk> .
So that &apos;s a very strange thing to notice .
And in fact , that &apos;s what I did in the <unk> show , the real <unk> , the real <unk> , in the same way , in the same place in the <unk> , in the other way .
It &apos;s pretty much <unk> .
And maybe a little bit more than a little bit , in the same way , as you might expect , as many as an <unk> , in the other hand , in the other hand , in many other lives , in many other forms of <unk> , I can consider myself as an Science Fiction .
And so , in this case , this Expeditionen has been done , and really , really , can be <unk> , so that &apos;s where he , as in the Tiefen <unk> , in the very <unk> , very difficult thing to do .
They &apos;re convenient to be standing in the world .
They live in a <unk> .
They don &apos;t live in a <unk> so that we don &apos;t have any <unk> .
And so that &apos;s the way that you know , the way I live in the way is that there &apos;s no <unk> <unk> .
They might be thinking , they might not be <unk> .
At the same time , I &apos;m going to get very much to get very much back in <unk> , and back to the Science Science as an <unk> .
And I &apos;ve been an <unk> in the <unk> , particularly an artist , <unk> an <unk> , real <unk> , I went in , I went in Russland , I went in Russland , and I went in , I went in that <unk> biomedizinischen <unk> , and all of the things , in the international Space Space Station .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s amazing .
But , as an effect , what I did in the war , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , in the air , in the <unk> .
And they put them on the <unk> , <unk> Wissenschaftlern , and <unk> , people who were going to be interested in the extreme environments , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
So here , we were to watch special images , but in fact , in fact , people have to do it .
I &apos;m going to get the Kreis out of the Science Fiction , and I think about it as a whole thing about the Science Fiction , and that &apos;s all right .
And you know , in my <unk> , I had a very <unk> .
I was interested in the world . But I was interested in <unk> .
Now , they might be thinking , &quot; <unk> , unfortunately , <unk> , unfortunately , Kapitän of the Schiff and the <unk> .
I didn &apos;t really know about the <unk> , until I did the Expeditionen .
Because I was in a way of saying , &quot; Was here ?
I mean , why do I do this ? I mean ?
We don &apos;t deserve a lot of the <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> . It &apos;s no <unk> .
People think more about the way I walked away from the Titanic and &quot; Avatar &quot; , and I &apos;m going to carry on with that , somewhere am Strand .
I have all these Filme , all of the <unk> in the room all the <unk> .
No <unk> , no , no , no .
You know , for the <unk> , for the Herausforderung , and the <unk> , the most <unk> Umwelt , which is , for those of you , for the magic Band , and for the seltsamen Band , which is as a small group of people .
Because all of the things that were happening in all of life has been working for a lot .
They played in a long way in <unk> Monaten .
And in fact , in the form , the most powerful thing that the <unk> is , is that , in fact , the <unk> thing that they have for them , and they say , they have a job that they can put on a person who doesn &apos;t have any other way .
Wenn man an <unk> , and man said , &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got to do this and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and that , and that , all of the technology and all of the things that you have , all of the things that you have in the world is that you can &apos;t tell . &quot;
This is a bridge , which creates a <unk> .
And as I came back to den nächsten Film , which was the &quot; Avatar &quot; , which , &quot; Avatar , &quot; which is , I &apos;m going to give this <unk> of leadership , which is that , in the way , that &apos;s a <unk> .
And that &apos;s what the <unk> .
And so I can bring back to a small Team , in a way , in the way , I didn &apos;t have a <unk> , &quot; Avatar , <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , very exciting .
<unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to have a Familie , for the four and a half .
And so , in effect , I didn &apos;t have to do it .
So , let &apos;s give a comment on the way that they , but , but , the <unk> Organismen , and then Pandora , Pandora .
And for me , the more powerful way , that <unk> , as well , as soon as changes .
So , well , can you put all this way ?
You know , was the <unk> Lehren ?
Well , I think , I &apos;m a lot of emotional .
You know , the mächtigste has ever been .
<unk> is a powerful thing to create real Realität .
And the main challenge ever , is wichtiger as all in all the claims .
I mean , he &apos;s kind of a jungen guy he got to go down and say , &quot; Gib me a <unk> . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> .
Other people , for the way they do it , they don &apos;t have to make no .
<unk> . &quot;
NASA has this Sprichwort that they say , &quot; <unk> is not a Option . &quot;
No one has a way in art in art and <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> .
And I don &apos;t have a very rich Unterfangen that has no <unk> .
Man muss bereit sein , Risiken einzugehen .
And so , the kind of thing that I &apos;m going to leave you with , is that , in a way , that was a <unk> , but a <unk> , but not . Danke .
I like to give you a lot of a particular person , like , that &apos;s the <unk> that we &apos;re using , you know , the <unk> .
Anstatt <unk> , I think , to think , I &apos;m thinking , well , I &apos;m going to ask you , I think , well , I can use Information , to <unk> , <unk> , that differently .
This is a very typical <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that I &apos;m using here is ein kleines Experiment .
You know , it &apos;s <unk> . I <unk> , and I can <unk> at a certain rate , at least , at a certain rate .
I &apos;m very similar to a different set pattern .
This is because in the middle here , in the middle , there &apos;s the <unk> , and there &apos;s the <unk> .
We can <unk> out of all kinds of <unk> and <unk> .
You know , the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and we &apos;re the üblichen Verdächtigen , but not for everyone .
When you go down , and in the way , in the way , in the way , at the age 40 Jahre jünger , we &apos;ll be at the age 40 Jahre jünger , and then you can think about the <unk> .
And in fact , in the way , in the middle , that &apos;s a lot of for people .
And the way I think was that , in the way , in the way , in the way , the way in the way that you know , in the way , in the way , is in a living room .
So , when you can do that , you can do it with <unk> ?
Now , here &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that you &apos;re <unk> .
This is all right here . It &apos;s all right .
You can go in the room , and they &apos;re going to get out of my Talk .
In fact , in the end , they &apos;re <unk> in <unk> .
You can zoom in in a <unk> .
You can <unk> in a certain amount .
So I kind of like this . I &apos;m going to be looking at the way that these are in the last part , the <unk> .
I love <unk> Armstrong , so I <unk> , I <unk> , and I like to play all of the <unk> Armstrong in <unk> Armstrong .
So , when I come here , I think , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you have all this <unk> ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to get a <unk> , and I <unk> .
Now , I can do it , I think Greg <unk> .
You know , the way they &apos;re in the way they get in the way of using Information , smaller and breiter , in the way , and , when they don &apos;t , they don &apos;t .
You know , it &apos;s a very different way .
So , yes , it &apos;s dazwischen , and we &apos;re thinking , well , there &apos;s the <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to get them to <unk> , a little <unk> .
So here &apos;s a <unk> page of Wikipedia , and they &apos;re stuck in a little <unk> .
And I mean , you know , they &apos;re <unk> in a small <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , to give them an <unk> .
I &apos;m just here at the top of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In fact , in fact , in all the very far , very much .
And so we can do a straight line in the context of the science that &apos;s <unk> in Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to get back and I have a <unk> .
You know , I know , you know , I know , I know , the <unk> , I think , the <unk> , I think , the <unk> , which is the <unk> .
Now , this is very wichtig , because that &apos;s very wichtig , in no <unk> <unk> .
You can only get them to get them out of the <unk> , and they &apos;re all zu <unk> .
So , when I have a <unk> , I can get back in the same way in the same time in the future magazine , in the Time magazine , in the Time magazine .
So , you know , you know , all of these people , I think , is that , I think , I think , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
Well , they &apos;re going to come from the <unk> .
One of the things that comes from the <unk> .
This is my Chef .
One part of the <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is that Bono , which is a <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> all of the TED <unk> .
So , in the middle , we &apos;re in the middle of the Web , if it &apos;s a Web , if you don &apos;t have the Web , you don &apos;t , but at a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to give you one another one ding , you know , I think , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to be surprised .
I &apos;ll be here at the page of the New York Times .
<unk> , I &apos;m going to show you , I don &apos;t have a Browser , but I don &apos;t have a Browser , but they can <unk> , but they &apos;re <unk> , and I can <unk> these <unk> technology in every <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get a <unk> , and I &apos;m in <unk> , right in a very <unk> section .
Now , this is a lot of all , which is , I know , I know , I &apos;ve got to get through the same way , and I have a very <unk> <unk> , so I can <unk> my very <unk> .
I can feel like I have a lot of time in the same time in the same time .
So here , here , the number of <unk> that I have .
I mean , I can do some kind of stuff , which I have to show you today .
So , when I get a <unk> and everything , I can , I can , I can get my <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
So here , I did a <unk> study , and I did Bing , and here Live Labs .
I &apos;m going to get back in the end of that page , and I can <unk> back .
So , you know , the <unk> , and every <unk> , and every time you can do it , and every time you can do it , it &apos;s all of the <unk> .
You know , in fact , in the world , it &apos;s a <unk> .
We &apos;re talking to the <unk> <unk> .
You know , we &apos;re dealing with <unk> .
So , when you can put it on the right path , and the Web at the end , where you can put in an <unk> , so where you can get an information in that way , so that you can get very much in many different things , and the Mustern , in the way , can be hidden .
When you can do that , you can &apos;t see in this data , but if you can do it , we can actually control it .
At the same time , but I can do things with the <unk> , but they can be <unk> .
And as you know , as you know , he may even be able to think of it as an elderly .
Thank you very much .
Every time you &apos;re talking to happiness .
I have to have any detail at the table , that in the last five years , in &quot; Glück &quot; in the book , and that &apos;s about 40 , and it &apos;s about 40 .
He &apos;s a lot of <unk> for happiness , for example .
He &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
People will be very happy to do .
But despite the amount of work , he has a lot of physical <unk> that they &apos;re doing in the way that they &apos;re thinking about happiness .
And I want to talk to you all the physical <unk> .
In fact , for normal , very good , very good at the time , and that &apos;s true for Forschern thinking , well , to be thinking , well , we &apos;re as much as all of us .
One of the things that <unk> , is that <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the very simple thing that has failed to do is no longer <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> .
I think he &apos;s a certain sense that if you can <unk> them , but all of the things that you have , is that , you know , that was that , you know , that was that , you know , so that you have to be <unk> , and you have to be <unk> Vision from it .
One of the things that <unk> , the <unk> between the <unk> and <unk> , is that , in fact , in the difference between the difference in the way that they &apos;re in love and happiness in the world &apos;s life or happiness in their lives .
And that &apos;s two different things that are in a lot of different things in a <unk> .
And drittens , there &apos;s the Illusion der Fokus , and der unglücklichen Umstand , that you don &apos;t have to be thinking , the impact on the ground , no <unk> .
I mean , this is really <unk> .
He has no way to do that gut .
Now , I &apos;d like to start to start with a <unk> that was going to be a <unk> and <unk> and a half .
And that &apos;s what the story .
Er said that there &apos;s a <unk> kind of <unk> , and that &apos;s absolutely fantastic Musik , and so on the end of the day , what was he doing ?
And then , really , really <unk> , you know , really <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> .
But that &apos;s not true .
We had Erinnerungen an <unk> .
You know , there &apos;s a <unk> .
There &apos;s a fantastic thing to get fantastic Musik .
They weren &apos;t more likely , because there were no thought about , you know , there &apos;s no thought back , and all of the sudden you have to do .
The thing that &apos;s <unk> is that , you know , the one person and others would be as two .
He &apos;s a <unk> I , who &apos;s in the Gegenwart , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in the past , you can see in the past , right ?
The Arzt comes down to the <unk> , I think , as the Arzt fragt , &quot; Is there so that you should be <unk> when I was here ? &quot;
And then , he &apos;s <unk> , and I <unk> the <unk> , and I <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , and that &apos;s the person in the way that the <unk> should be <unk> ?
Of course , what was your <unk> ? &quot;
In fact , the two very different things , you know , I and I <unk> , and I <unk> , and I <unk> , and so on , between the two parts of the <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
And so it &apos;s really focused on the fundamental expression of our Erinnerungen , right now .
We don &apos;t have to tell the stories about the way they care about Geschichten .
Your Gedächtnis has been telling us , &quot; The <unk> , &quot; is that , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s a <unk> .
And I have to start with a very <unk> .
This is a <unk> .
This is real Patienten that <unk> surgery .
I don &apos;t even enjoy the Detail . This is not schmerzhaft , but it &apos;s what schmerzhaft in the 1990er happened in the 90ern .
We have to give them every 60 Sekunden <unk> .
And these are two patients .
This is their <unk> .
And he &apos;s asking , &quot; How did you think about that ? &quot;
And that &apos;s a very simple question .
It &apos;s clear that that person B has been <unk> .
And there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and for every minute , the Patient A has a number of <unk> A . A <unk> B he wrote .
But here &apos;s another question : How much do you think about this Patienten that they had ?
And it &apos;s a very surprising thing : The One has a lot of <unk> , which has a huge decline in the <unk> .
The reason for the <unk> <unk> , is that a very wichtigen Abschnitt of the <unk> is <unk> , and not all of those Geschichten , very inspirierend , but only one of them , but one of them , but only one of them , but one of them , but one of them is <unk> .
And the most amazing thing is , in the end , in the end , in the end , in the <unk> .
This is a terrifying story .
You know ? Because these people , after all , after the fact , we asked these people to be <unk> , and a lot of us , well , well , so much .
And it &apos;s a lot of <unk> for A to B , in their minds .
Well , that &apos;s an <unk> Konflikt between the <unk> and <unk> .
I think of the Standpunkt des <unk> , I think B was very <unk> .
You know , well , you can do a <unk> A . And in fact , in the same way , and that &apos;s what happened , and that &apos;s what happened , and that &apos;s how they can put the <unk> A , and they can put it on the plate , and they have no <unk> .
Now , that makes you believe that the Patient leidet <unk> , but not much .
And when they get a couple of Minuten for the <unk> I made a lot of <unk> , and I have a lot of <unk> , and I made it a lot of a lot of a lot better , but I can get a lot of it to be a very <unk> fact , and I can give it a <unk> <unk> .
Was does a story ?
And this is where to the <unk> the <unk> , and it &apos;s true for the <unk> , and it &apos;s true for the <unk> .
One of the things that you have , is powerful , such as powerful moments and <unk> .
<unk> are very , very <unk> , and in this way , that &apos;s the <unk> .
You know , I live in my life forever .
In fact , the same thing , the one for the other .
And they &apos;re asking , well , was it in this Momenten ?
And that &apos;s very simple .
They have lost forever .
I think of the fact of the kind of moments of life -- I have -- I think , you know , you know , you know , the psychological audience needs to have more than three minutes .
This is , in a way , in a lifetime , it &apos;s about 600 Millionen .
In one Monat , it &apos;s about 600,000 .
They don &apos;t have a <unk> .
I didn &apos;t know a lot of a <unk> .
And yet , in the one way , the way that they have , more or less , is that , in the way , that , in the case , that was in <unk> , that was living in life .
It &apos;s the <unk> Ressource that are <unk> , but in the world .
And so , as you know , it &apos;s relevant to be relevant , but I didn &apos;t believe that , but I didn &apos;t have to do it .
And so I have <unk> , and I have <unk> , and I &apos;m very different .
That &apos;s a huge difference between both two .
In fact , I have a Urlaub , and I have a Urlaub , and the zweite Woche , as well as the two days of the time , the two days more than the Urlaub have zweimal in the morning .
So that &apos;s not for the <unk> .
I mean , for the <unk> , I have a Urlaub in the morning in the late days of the time of a day , because he has no neuen Erinnerungen <unk> .
The reason they didn &apos;t have changed .
And in the way , the critical variable that I have , I think I was an <unk> of a <unk> .
Now , for instance , that &apos;s a very <unk> effect .
I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
This is the way that they have Entscheidungen right now , when they have a Patienten that , but , but two <unk> have two different occasions for two different Chirurgen , and then entscheiden , to do , then , to the <unk> , to the <unk> Erinnerung , and that &apos;s der <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> .
You know , I don &apos;t have a public health card .
We don &apos;t have <unk> .
We have a chance of having an opportunity . <unk> and <unk> , and even when you think of the time , we don &apos;t think of the future as an <unk> .
We think of the future , as an <unk> Erinnerungen .
And in fact , in the case that , as a <unk> , I think , as a <unk> , I think , I can be <unk> as the <unk> , I mean , I don &apos;t have to have the <unk> , I don &apos;t have to have , I have , I don &apos;t have to have the time , that &apos;s the case that , in the Urlaub , for the most people , for the most <unk> , I can serve .
And that &apos;s pretty much <unk> .
I mean , why are we using all of our Erinnerungen ?
This is one of the <unk> that has been given for the Dominanz of the <unk> .
And as I thought about , I think I thought about a Urlaub , I think , in a couple of years in the Antarktis , that &apos;s very good at the time that you can imagine what was happening , and I think very häufig , very <unk> .
And I have to have to have my chance in the four minutes in the four minutes for three minutes in the last four minutes .
Now , when I got on the right , I can put on the top of the 600 Bildern <unk> , I &apos;d give you a <unk> .
This is also three Wochen , and that &apos;s fast 30 Stunden .
He &apos;s a <unk> .
Now , maybe I &apos;m a little <unk> , you know , in the <unk> Hunger , I have to have Erinnerungen , but even as you can do it , the <unk> , why can &apos;t be so much an idea , but in response , in response , in terms of all ?
And so I &apos;m thinking about a <unk> .
If you think about the place in the morning , you know , at the end of the Urlaub , you know , at the end of all the time , the <unk> , and the <unk> , which you have , you know , you don &apos;t have to be an <unk> .
Would the more common Urlaub ? And as a result , in the time , the Urlaub , he would like to be in the two <unk> .
And they have to be thinking about , well , how can you pay attention .
Now , that &apos;s not as usual , as if you think about the time , when you think about the time of the time .
And as you might be thinking about Erinnerungen , they might be different .
Now , why can we choose the <unk> aussuchen that are <unk> with the <unk> .
Now , the two <unk> suffer in a <unk> .
In fact , he &apos;s a lot of great <unk> that you can do .
And so they can ask , why am I <unk> ?
And then , like , why am I going to ask , why am I in the middle of the world &apos;s time , I think ?
And so it &apos;s all -- the happiness of the time is a very komplizierten Prozess .
What are the people who are <unk> ?
In fact , there &apos;s a very good way of looking at a very good way of looking at the <unk> .
When you have an <unk> , I think I &apos;m a very different job .
This is not about how to live in any way .
So , you know , you know , you know , you can think about this person , as the person thinks about what was about .
<unk> .
One of the things that <unk> all of them brings in a lot of the time from the <unk> , and I <unk> , and I <unk> in a group of <unk> , and I <unk> in a group of <unk> for the long term of happiness in this way .
I mean , the reason for the happiness of the <unk> , I and I , at the point of view , is looking at the <unk> <unk> , and now , I think , that &apos;s now , the two separate workers who have a global <unk> <unk> , where you have an <unk> <unk> , where they &apos;re thinking about , was more than a halbe Million people who are thinking about what they &apos;re thinking about .
And he &apos;s very <unk> in the way .
In fact , in the last few years , at the very least , at the time of the two <unk> .
And the <unk> of the <unk> , I think , is that the real difference .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , at the time , and umgekehrt .
Just a minute , the reason that the reaction is about , the <unk> is about 0.5 .
This is , when you &apos;re going to be someone , and you know , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s a <unk> 80 , so that &apos;s a <unk> 80 , so much more than how much .
You know , the more important thing to be about , but it &apos;s a lot of Unsicherheit .
Now , as much Unsicherheit as I have to tell you , when I tell you that somebody at the age of 10 , 10 to 10 , so many , in the 10 , so they have a lot of Unsicherheit to be on the <unk> .
So the reaction is <unk> .
You know , I know anything about the <unk> .
You know , the fact is that it &apos;s a lot of great , <unk> Ziele .
You know , you know , the happiness is , you know , you &apos;re zufrieden with people , for the way they can do it , indem wir people who can do .
He &apos;s another <unk> , but that &apos;s just <unk> .
So , as you have the reason for the two <unk> , the way that they have to do so many different things .
Now , the way I have here , is that , you know , you can &apos;t believe happiness as an <unk> for Wohlbefinden .
It &apos;s a very different <unk> .
And now , very bald -- a different talk , which may not seem to be thinking about happiness , is that , in the same way , that we don &apos;t have to feel at the same time , and as we have to live in life .
So when you ask the simple question , the simple person in California , don &apos;t have the richtige Antwort .
When you ask the question , the people need to be in the <unk> , in California , in the <unk> .
And this was when you think in the place in California in the place of California and other cities , and in the other hand , in the place between California and other cities , as well .
Now , that &apos;s not true that <unk> , for the <unk> , I don &apos;t have to ask , I don &apos;t even ask , I don &apos;t have to ask , &quot; I believe , I don &apos;t believe it .
But , but , but , I think , the <unk> , I think , can seem to be able to figure out that some people in California .
And so it &apos;s interesting to where he &apos;s going to be able to get people who , in California , in the <unk> .
Well , they don &apos;t have to be <unk> .
We know .
But one thing it does . They think , they think , they &apos;re glücklicher , but they thought , well , they &apos;re thinking about that , they thought , well , that &apos;s in Ohio .
And they think that they &apos;re the richtige Entscheidung .
It &apos;s very schwierig , <unk> , <unk> , and I hoffe , I have a minute of so much <unk> .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question .
Thank you very much .
And as soon as a couple of Wochen in the lines , I told you , he &apos;s a very interesting point of view from the <unk> .
Would you have to be able to share with you a couple of Minuten ?
Daniel <unk> : I think the most interesting thing that <unk> at the <unk> is that if you haven &apos;t thought of it .
So , you have to do it in the <unk> .
When you see , the real difference is affecting the <unk> .
In fact , in the <unk> of 60,000 dollars in <unk> , for the U.S . , and then , it &apos;s about a very large number of Amerikaner , roughly 600,000 , so 600,000 , you know , <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> , by the <unk> $ <unk> .
CA : 60,000 DK : 60,000 60,000 dollars in <unk> , more than you have to be poor .
We have a very similar <unk> .
I mean , I know , I have fast so much <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s obvious , which is that if you don &apos;t have a <unk> , but you don &apos;t have a lot of money , but you can &apos;t manage to manage harm , and you can <unk> in a lot of great , very <unk> .
I mean , for the other one , I have a very different <unk> .
You can earn your money , you know , you know , you know .
I mean , that &apos;s not true .
CA : But Danny , at the very <unk> , is <unk> , Freiheit , and <unk> <unk> .
As a result , the way that happens is that , as far as we do , it would seem to be anything at all , but <unk> , <unk> , and so .
Is it a Chance that can do that , so that &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the <unk> , so that <unk> , <unk> ?
DK : Well , I think , I think he &apos;s Anerkennung at the <unk> .
The answer is that , in the United States , in the United States , that leidet no <unk> , but in the U.K . , in the U.K . , in the U.K . , in other countries .
People realize that they have to think about happiness as well as an <unk> .
We have a <unk> , and then people diskutieren from the question , or <unk> , or at the <unk> , or at the <unk> of the lives of the lives of the lives of <unk> .
So , as you gain happiness , you &apos;re very different , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and I think about the <unk> , I think , I am .
This has <unk> in the very <unk> . I think .
In the United States , for the last year , for the <unk> der Population .
I mean , I think in a couple of places in the United States .
CA : Well , I think that &apos;s what I think is that this was interesting for me , that might be <unk> for the very few .
Thank you very much for the <unk> of the <unk> .
Thank you , Danny <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk to you now , and <unk> .
And that might be a very surprising thing to do , because my Vollzeitjob , in the <unk> , is to be at all , to be at Impfstoffen and Samen , to be able to support all of these things , to the ärmsten two billion people .
But Energie and <unk> are very rich in all of these people , in fact , in fact , in the same way , as much as on the planet .
That Klima verschlechtert , so that they don &apos;t have to grow .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , too .
Things have changed , so that they don &apos;t have sustainable <unk> .
And that &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> .
This is a <unk> for them .
The price of the <unk> is very rich to them .
In fact , the one thing they can do with them can get günstiger to reduce them , to the world .
The <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> Zivilisation is <unk> Zivilisation .
In fact , in the 20th Revolution , in the 20th Revolution , and even in the 20th Jahrhundert , which has a very schnellen <unk> for Elektrizität , and that &apos;s how <unk> , you know , <unk> , you can have modern Materialien and so much .
And so we have a beautiful situation in the reichen world .
You know , now , you &apos;re billiger -- and let &apos;s take them out of the same thing as well -- it &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and that &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> at the <unk> is a very simple .
So , as the <unk> , the CO2 that comes from , is that <unk> has been <unk> , and the <unk> has been zu <unk> .
And so , the <unk> and , you know , the <unk> , the <unk> , that <unk> affect the <unk> , that natürlichen Ökosysteme don &apos;t have to fit in the same way , and so in order to do Ökosysteme .
Now , the very short amount of time , you know , you know , you know , at a certain amount of carbon in the <unk> , and where positive <unk> , you know , can &apos;t do anything .
And in fact , there &apos;s a lot of Unsicherheit to be about , but they &apos;re very <unk> .
I &apos;ve been asking that for <unk> .
Is it real right ?
How do we not have a <unk> ?
And the answer is that , as far as we reach out in the middle , the <unk> .
And that &apos;s a huge problem .
It &apos;s very different , very different , as far as to get a <unk> ship out of a <unk> meter that can be <unk> .
This is a <unk> .
Well , it &apos;s a lot of CO2 <unk> , more than 26 billion metric tons .
Every one of the Amerikaner is about 20 metric .
In poor countries , it &apos;s weniger as a metric .
It &apos;s a Durchschnitt of five metric tons to every day .
And so , you have to have , you know , anything else , that <unk> , that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> .
All of the wirtschaftlichen Wandel , which has <unk> , is to have a <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , and a <unk> .
This <unk> .
<unk> .
So , you know , one of the links , the <unk> , which means that there &apos;s no <unk> , and that &apos;s where you &apos;re <unk> by <unk> by <unk> by <unk> by <unk> .
So , let &apos;s have this very little <unk> , and you can see , you can <unk> that .
One has to be one of these Werte in the <unk> .
This is a <unk> School of Mathematik , but let &apos;s start .
One , we have the Population .
The world is currently <unk> Milliarden .
That &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
So , as well as we have a very good <unk> , Gesundheitsversorgung , Gesundheitsversorgung , <unk> , but maybe 10 15 percent , but maybe 10 15 percent , but that &apos;s a <unk> .
The zweite Faktor is that we &apos;re using .
This is all , you know , so that <unk> , you can play , Kleidung , TV , <unk> .
This is very good , very good , and it &apos;s <unk> in poverty , which means that you have to <unk> all of them on the planet .
And so it &apos;s a huge thing as well .
In the reichen world , maybe , at least , at the top 1 Milliarden , can be <unk> and <unk> , but in <unk> , but in fact , in the same way , at the same time , the <unk> <unk> , and so on , in fact , the <unk> Services by <unk> .
This is a very simple <unk> .
<unk> , in the course of the way , to the <unk> , the <unk> , so that they don &apos;t know , so they go out , and they &apos;re going to bring them back to the <unk> .
So , Effizienz , E , <unk> .
Well , that &apos;s a good news .
You know , it &apos;s a <unk> .
We have multiple Erfindungen and <unk> <unk> , using other kinds of cars , other people .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> , where you can have the power to get back .
<unk> <unk> , even 90 percent .
And so he &apos;s a <unk> Services , so that &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
And so , as you &apos;re optimistic , I can get out there , you can get out there , probably , <unk> , <unk> .
But for those three things that are 26 billion , we &apos;re 26 billion , 13 billion , and that &apos;s not genug .
So , look at the very <unk> Faktor -- that &apos;s a <unk> -- and that &apos;s the <unk> .
So the question is , can you do that ?
If you don &apos;t have a <unk> .
When the <unk> <unk> .
In virtually jedem Art , in the same way , at the same time , at the same time , at the <unk> , at the <unk> , at least , CO2 .
And so on global scale , it &apos;s a neues System .
And so we have <unk> .
So as I &apos;m asking you , I don &apos;t have a <unk> , I don &apos;t have to do it .
The <unk> is ein Wunder . The PC is an <unk> .
The Internet , and there &apos;s a <unk> .
And so the people here have a lot of Wunder to be very successful .
<unk> have no <unk> , when you have a <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , in the end , they &apos;re <unk> , and they didn &apos;t .
This is a case , in this case , in a very <unk> cycle , and a Wunder can get in a very tight press .
Now , I thought , well , why do you know ?
Is it the way that it &apos;s like the <unk> <unk> , which is a picture for people ?
I thought about a <unk> , when I looked at a <unk> and I thought about the other way .
And they were really interested in the way that he &apos;s going to be able to get people to the <unk> .
So , I mean , with a lot of stuff , what I can do ?
I entschied , in the way , in the way that I &apos;m going to give it a place in the street here .
So here &apos;s the green way .
I said , you know , they don &apos;t move , you don &apos;t , you know , you don &apos;t even know the sand .
So , you know , he &apos;s all kinds of personal kinds of things that , but they don &apos;t have very much .
We have a <unk> , you know , you know , in a very <unk> Ausmaß , at a very large scale , and a very <unk> <unk> , and all of a sudden , people in many Richtungen , I think , actually , I can actually get five to the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
They might be able to put it in a <unk> , and when they can do it , I think , I can do it , I think , I can have a <unk> , but I have to have an <unk> , and they can &apos;t have , because it &apos;s so <unk> , because it &apos;s so <unk> , so that it &apos;s kind of like that , right ?
Let &apos;s go back to fossilen Brennstoffe , which is a <unk> <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s kind of like that , maybe , but it &apos;s not .
Man muss all of the CO2 emissions by the <unk> , and <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and hoffen , they can do it .
Now , he has a number of <unk> that <unk> at 60 percent , but it &apos;s 100 percent , so very , very <unk> , and you have to live in 100 percent , and you have very much <unk> , but that &apos;s the <unk> .
So , how do you know ?
So , how do you know that <unk> can be <unk> at the same time , where the kind of <unk> is in terms of all of the <unk> or other things ?
This is a huge amount .
So that &apos;s how much .
The one is <unk> .
In order to make three big problems .
The cost of <unk> , in a very <unk> country , is .
Now , the <unk> , real confidence that they don &apos;t have to do that , so that , obwohl all of the people , you know , has no <unk> .
And was a <unk> ?
And , as you know , it &apos;s not very much .
We have a very good <unk> .
In order to do three very difficult problems that might be <unk> .
In the last three of five , I <unk> .
This is a very <unk> <unk> .
And that -- but it &apos;s very amazing that they don &apos;t have a <unk> -- but a couple of Nachteile .
One of them is that the amount of gas in the power of all the <unk> is <unk> , as the <unk> .
This is <unk> , like , you know , more <unk> , more than <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for the <unk> power .
You know , the <unk> .
And so , the Sonne doesn &apos;t mean , and not every day , and , no , no .
And as you have , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , we have a way to get a lot of them in the field , where they don &apos;t .
So here &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
We have a <unk> .
For example , the Energiequelle that comes out in the world is not only not having to have the technology , but they &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> .
And , finally , <unk> .
And so , in fact , I have to look at all of these types of Batterien that are made by the <unk> , for the phone , for the <unk> , for the <unk> , for the other , and the amount of electric power in the world , and I thought , well , all of the Batterien that we &apos;re doing in the world , and I thought , well , all of the smart stuff that we &apos;re doing today ?
And so here &apos;s a huge repertoire , which is a <unk> that you can have , you know , the <unk> .
It &apos;s not unmöglich , but it &apos;s not very simple .
This is a lot of the time that comes out of the <unk> Ressource , for 20 bis 30 percent of 30 percent .
When you get 100 percent per <unk> , you have a <unk> .
So , you know , it &apos;s <unk> , which is that right ?
Is there <unk> ? You can do that ?
Well , you know , it &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
In every five , you can , mindestens 100 .
And a lot of them , they &apos;re silly , but it &apos;s okay .
And , I think , in the <unk> , here &apos;s a lot of people that are all <unk> .
Bill <unk> has a lot of <unk> . This is a <unk> <unk> .
In fact , unfortunately , in Dutzenden Unternehmen , the amazing things have been doing and interesting <unk> , and I have to do this .
Nathan Myhrvold and I got a supply chain that might be very , very <unk> .
It &apos;s a couple of innovations in Atomenergie , <unk> , and flüssig .
And he &apos;s for all of you don &apos;t have to get a lot of stuff in this industry , which is also not so strange that he &apos;s good , so he &apos;s good .
And the idea of <unk> is that , right , anstelle a small <unk> , one percent , which is <unk> , and then <unk> , <unk> , and then <unk> .
Now , a slightly <unk> way .
You know , you &apos;re thinking about that , but they didn &apos;t expect to Simulation .
But in <unk> , you can do that , and yeah !
With the very good <unk> .
And because of the 99 percent , the cost of <unk> .
They used to get rid of the <unk> , and as Treibstoff can use all the natural <unk> of very <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , is great .
They used this <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> .
And in fact , in fact , in fact , the <unk> <unk> .
For the Treibstoff , this is really helpful .
I was a picture of a place in Kentucky .
This is <unk> , 99 percent , where one percent <unk> .
This is <unk> Uran .
This is genug for the United States .
And then , in a billigen way , the <unk> <unk> , which means that we can <unk> genug Treibstoff on the planet .
And so he , he &apos;s a lot of Herausforderungen for the future , but it &apos;s a lot of <unk> of the number of <unk> and <unk> with the <unk> .
So let &apos;s think about how do you know ?
So , you know ?
Let &apos;s see , right ? We have , and then in the <unk> .
By 2050 , more than 80 percent reduction .
And so it &apos;s wirklich wichtig , so much .
And the 20 Prozent <unk> are going to get to poor countries , a <unk> .
You can be <unk> and <unk> .
And so , to get 80 percent <unk> in the North America , as China , as well as China , <unk> .
And the other one : <unk> , <unk> technology in all the entwickelten Ländern , and then in all of us , in addition to looking at the hospital ?
That &apos;s great .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
So , why is that <unk> in <unk> ?
Well , they have to fill the two .
We have to have a <unk> increase in the <unk> .
So , you know , you know , you know , you can <unk> , you know , so that <unk> , so that <unk> .
But in some ways , the amount of stuff that has never been able to do it in the very <unk> <unk> , but even worse , maybe even if the other one , you know , maybe even worse , that &apos;s the <unk> .
All of the Durchbrüche in all of this has got to be <unk> , and we can control the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> things that have changed .
This is a huge amount of amazing Büchern .
The <unk> of Al Gore , &quot; Our <unk> &quot; and that Buch of David <unk> &apos;s <unk> , &quot; <unk> Energy . &quot;
They &apos;re very good , and they &apos;re very good , and they &apos;re very <unk> , that can be <unk> in very large ways , right ?
It &apos;s a lot of it .
This is a <unk> .
It &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s a <unk> .
As a matter of fact , I might be a <unk> for the next 50 , I would like to look like Präsident , I can do a Impfstoff , I can do a <unk> , I would like to ask , if I can do something with the cost of <unk> , which is that , you know , I can ask .
This is the <unk> Auswirkung .
When you don &apos;t have to do this , the <unk> between the people who are thinking about as long as far as far as far as to be in between the United States and China , between poor and reicheren Nationen , and most of the time in the two Milliarde .
So , do you have ?
And so I ask you to have ?
We &apos;ve got to go out for a <unk> .
As a country , in an area as Copenhagen , they don &apos;t have to talk about the CO2 .
They have to list all of these <unk> , and they &apos;re amazed at all of those innovative technological Ausgaben to these innovative Ansätze .
We have <unk> , <unk> , Decke , and Handel , things like the cost .
Wir müssen <unk> .
We have a lot of <unk> and <unk> , and they &apos;ve got to be <unk> , and they have a <unk> .
This is a <unk> , but I think , but I think they can .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you . I can do more in <unk> , okay -- I can tell you , the first place , you know , can give you a <unk> in the <unk> ?
Bill Gates : Um the software , the <unk> , all of the great Wissenschaftler , all of the big Wissenschaftler , and all of you have to do it , is that , in fact , it &apos;s <unk> in a very <unk> Reaktor , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , all of the <unk> works in the <unk> , so that <unk> in the <unk> .
And so it &apos;s very nice to be the very <unk> , the few billion , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the way that they &apos;re going to have the <unk> .
Once you have the first ones , as you know , as well as <unk> , it &apos;s very common , because the <unk> , the <unk> , so different , as different as the <unk> , as different as you know .
CA : And so , but , well , right ?
BG : Well , that &apos;s true . You have to be able to get back to the <unk> , and also have a lot of people and a lot of all of the Kontrollen that they can do , and they have to do it , and <unk> .
That &apos;s not good .
As a very <unk> Treibstoff , the 60 Jahre <unk> , but it &apos;s an <unk> -- but it &apos;s an <unk> -- put them on the ground , and they don &apos;t have any of them .
And there &apos;s only one and <unk> back in <unk> , and then it &apos;s done .
CA : You know , it &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
BG : Yeah . Well , well , well , well , that &apos;s a <unk> , man can put it in -- it &apos;s a lot of <unk> , which is , you know , that &apos;s where you &apos;re <unk> , or , you know , in the way that they &apos;re <unk> , and <unk> it in one another , in the other one , they <unk> .
And now , we &apos;re starting to <unk> , which is right now , that &apos;s where it &apos;s in <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
And so , as a matter of fact , what &apos;s happening in the world is that actually , in the same way , in the same way that &apos;s in the <unk> , and you reduce the amount of <unk> in the <unk> .
CA : But in the course of all , in the global conversation , where does that mean that people have an amazing thing to do ?
BG : Well , I don &apos;t have a certain opportunity , and he &apos;s very interesting , and he &apos;s very interesting to all of this <unk> , so that &apos;s very <unk> , so that people are in love in Russland , China .
I &apos;m looking at the <unk> of the <unk> .
So I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the Franzosen and the Japaner and the Japaner have done .
This is a <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s a <unk> , but it &apos;s as a <unk> , and a lot of land , and so many countries have them , so that they have a <unk> , and they &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> .
CA : So , in the way , in the spirit , Zeitplan and Wahrscheinlichkeit of so that can do that .
BG : You know , well , I &apos;ve got to get in a huge amount of stuff to be able to get it very <unk> , 20 years old , for 20 years , for 20 years .
That &apos;s a kind of <unk> that has been given to the <unk> that you have .
And , you know , <unk> , as well , as well , it &apos;s very good , very much better .
And he &apos;s very fortunate to have to have to get to the <unk> , which means that , as well , as well as good , as well as good , as well , where they can do that .
And the best thing they &apos;re doing is that they can use all of these things in order to use all these things .
One of us can get to get them .
CA : All right in terms of <unk> , which is that the biggest that you know ?
BG : It &apos;s a <unk> .
And so , you know , there &apos;s no <unk> , but it &apos;s the <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> .
In the <unk> , there &apos;s other Innovatoren .
You know , you know , we don &apos;t know very gut about this , but the <unk> people , that &apos;s another way .
It &apos;s a kind of <unk> that looks very schwierig , but they might be saying , well , they &apos;re going to be .
And so he &apos;s a different one , but the beauty of that is <unk> , so many more than 50 times as much as an <unk> , and so , as you can , in the negative Effekte , the <unk> and the cost , the <unk> , the <unk> and the cost , the <unk> , in terms of <unk> .
CA : So that doesn &apos;t work .
So , can we start with the <unk> <unk> , so that <unk> can be <unk> ?
BG : Well , when you &apos;re in the situation , it &apos;s like , if you can have übergewichtig , and that &apos;s a <unk> .
Right ? You know ? You can have a <unk> .
He &apos;s a series of thousands of thousands , which means that there &apos;s a different kind of Techniken that <unk> out of the <unk> , which <unk> , in the 20 , 30 last year .
This is a <unk> .
They don &apos;t have to get them .
Some people say that they don &apos;t have to work in such a Versicherungen , because they can get somebody to do it , because they &apos;re <unk> , because they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
I don &apos;t know what a good thing is , but it &apos;s an <unk> , but he &apos;s now talking to that , in the <unk> , for the <unk> , for the <unk> , for the <unk> , when it comes to the <unk> , where you might expect .
CA : <unk> Skeptiker : when one or two years , they &apos;re going to tell you that they &apos;re going to get them to get wrong ?
BG : Well , sorry , that &apos;s all in different Lagern .
He &apos;s very few thousands of minutes .
<unk> them , that negative <unk> that have to have to do things about the ocean ?
He &apos;s very , very few things that they can offer in one Millionen , the <unk> .
The biggest problem here is that as an AIDS <unk> .
Now , right now , right now , the wrong thing , and he zahlt that .
And yes , when you have all sorts of pressing trouble , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , we can <unk> the good ones -- and a kind of mess .
In fact , <unk> doesn &apos;t have any <unk> <unk> , and in fact , and it &apos;s people in the reicheren world , and they &apos;re saying , well , that &apos;s all very much .
This has to be the Unsicherheit that &apos;s <unk> .
I mean , my Traum is that , wenn man wirtschaftlich down , and <unk> , and <unk> , and I &apos;m sure , I don &apos;t have to feel like that , I don &apos;t have to feel like that , I might not feel like that , but I mean , I &apos;m sure that it &apos;s <unk> .
CA : And that &apos;s what makes you think about the fact of <unk> <unk> , that actually , where you all know all the power of the <unk> , you know , where you all know the power of the <unk> , and Malaria , and so on , you know , all of the other things , you know , can go out of poverty and Malaria , and so .
You know , it &apos;s a dummen resource for saving money , as if he can do better things that can .
BG : Well , right now , the real <unk> <unk> -- saying , &quot; The United States <unk> can have 10 billion more likely to spend 10 billion more <unk> than now .
It hasn &apos;t been done in other things .
It &apos;s very real in huge cost , and that &apos;s very common , very common people think differently , when they &apos;re <unk> .
I think that &apos;s a <unk> .
There &apos;s no way that they &apos;re very dense in a <unk> , and they &apos;re just <unk> <unk> .
I think , you know , I can have a lot of things that have a lot of <unk> .
As a result , the <unk> , where you can do it , let &apos;s get to the amount of stuff as well .
I mean , I can do all of us here , so much in the same way that we can have no hope for the <unk> .
The amount of two billion .
And even <unk> has changed .
Now , right now , there &apos;s no <unk> .
The thing about it , is that , in fact , in the <unk> , it &apos;s very easy to <unk> , but it &apos;s got to be very isolated in <unk> Lager , and now , you have R &amp; amp ; D .
And so it &apos;s a very <unk> Draht , I think , I think .
So , you know , it &apos;s a lot of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
CA : Bill , I think , I think I &apos;m going to talk to you guys here , saying , I &apos;m really sure that your Wunsch can be fine . Vielen Dank .
BG : Thank you .
Let me take you a couple of Monate in a couple of Monaten , when I looked at a couple of Monate for the <unk> Wired .
I am quiet for the <unk> when I was writing on the right , but I have to do all of the <unk> , and I had to show you , &quot; I didn &apos;t have the word &quot; <unk> &quot; .
I &apos;m reading the text .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : Good , strong , <unk> . &quot;
I read this for a friend , and they have to laugh at a laugh , because that &apos;s what kind of weird stuff looked like , and I have to stop <unk> , and I have to stop there , for the emotional Schock , and all of the things that were <unk> .
Well , that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
I think that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
But it &apos;s a <unk> walk out of 80 , when I started to think about the Grundschule , and I started to get a picture of myself in my Familie , and I was looking at the other Kinder and the world , to me .
I don &apos;t have to tell you , I didn &apos;t use a <unk> .
