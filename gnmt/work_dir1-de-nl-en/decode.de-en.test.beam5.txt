A couple of years ago , here at TED , Peter <unk> a <unk> , &quot; That <unk> &quot; ,
That &apos;s a very simple way of putting it out . <unk> has to be <unk> that <unk> <unk> with 20 balls , it &apos;s <unk> tape , <unk> tape , and an marshmallow .
The marshmallow has to be <unk> .
And , in fact , it &apos;s really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really hard , want it is very hard to cooperate .
And I think this is an interesting thing , and I &apos;ve been growing into a <unk> .
It was a big deal .
And this is what I &apos;ve been doing in this world in a way in the world , with studenten , <unk> and architecten and architecten , <unk> , and this is what makes more sense , and that &apos;s what makes more sense to anybody in the world at that moment .
It turns out that most people start to engage in the field of view .
And you know , you know , how it &apos;s going to be , how it &apos;s going to be , the power of power .
Now , what happens is , in fact , is a very short time in planning , and you put spaghetti .
They &apos;re going to grow a lot of their time in the world in constant culture .
And then , in addition , people don &apos;t have to do it , the marshmallow gets the marshmallow , and put it on top of the top , and they &apos;re going to turn on the top , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
And then , in fact , it happens , that &apos;s the &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; , want to be <unk> , because the gewicht of the <unk> can be done , that &apos;s the gewicht of the <unk> and <unk> .
And it is a set of people , who much more &quot; <unk> &quot; , <unk> <unk> as other , and it &apos;s <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , and they are <unk> , and they are <unk> .
And , natuurlijk , teams that are much more &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , and it &apos;s the <unk> .
And it &apos;s quite amazing .
Who made Peter said not to be the hoogste body , but it was also the most important structure of all .
What they might think is , &quot; Who &apos;s got this ? Who ? &quot;
Peter says , &quot; <unk> of the kind of <unk> , the middle of the spaghetti <unk> of spaghetti . &quot;
They tend to do not in <unk> .
And it &apos;s a different issue .
And in fact , it &apos;s going to be trained to have a different plan , the reason , OK !
And it &apos;s going on .
What happens when they put the marshmallow down on top of the top , they have no time and what they did ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
<unk> it , was ?
The other thing that &apos;s been doing is that they start to start with the marshmallow and prototype prototypes , succesvolle prototypes , and it &apos;s all the marshmallow on the top , so that they can get <unk> prototypes .
<unk> recognize this type of samenwerking as an essence of a <unk> .
And with every test , that kind of quickly had feedback , and not feedback .
That &apos;s the performance , on prototypes , one , but we &apos;re going to see , who are different teams .
That &apos;s the gemiddelde guy at the same time , at least , at least , to <unk> , <unk> , whatever , but not much , much more , but not much , much , much better ,
How is your age ?
architecten and ingenieurs , all right .
<unk> is the <unk> , which I had seen .
And why ? Omdat we driehoeken and <unk> geometric design is the key to build <unk> structuren .
CEO <unk> <unk> , but this is interesting .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the team , they got significant .
It &apos;s amazing . You see , you know , &quot; This team is going to win . &quot;
They can voorspellen . Why is it ?
because they &apos;ve got speciale skills of <unk> .
They meet the proces , they know it .
And this team , it <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> , is the performance of the team .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> , and they &apos;re going to win .
If you &apos;ve got 10 teams , which is the typical , you know , you have six , which have <unk> .
I &apos;ve got a lot of fun .
I think , we know the <unk> of the sound .
So , bone , I was a $ <unk> prize ,
&quot; Well , what do you think ? &quot;
Was &apos;s the outcome ?
Here it was . I didn &apos;t have a <unk> structuur .
If you had a <unk> flag , there had to be a <unk> high school ,
Is it not interesting , is that high ?
We <unk> this training with those of us .
Now , what &apos;s it ?
Now , you know the answer of the &quot; <unk> &quot; .
This is a very , very , very <unk> team of one .
That &apos;s the biggest thing that &apos;s in the crash .
We &apos;re also <unk> <unk> , over the way , over the world of motor creation .
They may ask , &quot; Well , what would we do ? &quot;
The issue is , I &apos;m going to help digital tools and processen , to help teams , using teams , music , games , and &quot; Visual <unk> . &quot;
And that &apos;s what they do , which is , you know , get them to be <unk> <unk> .
Because open up , every project has his <unk> .
That challenge is a gedeelde ervaring , a shared taal , of <unk> , the actual prototype ,
And this is the waarde of this , this is a very simple training .
And you know , those of you who are interested in <unk> .
It &apos;s a blog , where you see , who <unk> it .
It &apos;s a <unk> guy .
And you think , you know , gekke voorbeelden of all over all over the world , who is the system optimaliseren ,
And it &apos;s also <unk> .
And that basic thing , I think , is that I think it is a <unk> sport .
We want to focus all our senses on that project , and that we think we use our <unk> , who our gevoelens and our stuff is , in that way , that &apos;s where we lie .
And soms is a quick prototype of all the time , all the time , it has to take us out of a &quot; <unk> &quot; ,
And it can be a big difference .
Thank you very much .
We were like this , as a machine ,
A big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and it &apos;s a tijdmachine ,
and each other in the middle of the room .
And in that future , you can go back in that toekomst , you can &apos;t be here in here and now .
And I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve been asking my family , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve been asking my family , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve been asking my personal <unk> , and they were all in that future .
I don &apos;t know . They were in that moment , for people , and Twitter , of course , of course , to Twitter , of course .
I don &apos;t know .
I think , you know , I think , you know , to be <unk> , to be naked .
I begrijp it .
I &apos;m not in this room , I have to say ,
I won &apos;t be in that future , and I &apos;m not , because I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
It &apos;s because of course , that &apos;s not going to be <unk> on the planet , they &apos;re <unk> .
I have in this machine , and I will go in that toekomst .
And this is the most common thing that you had on on the planet , which you were on on the planet , the scale , rijkdom , inequality , mobiliteit , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It was never a while ago .
My <unk> , my <unk> , were all 60 .
And my grootouders , I <unk> this ,
My mother is 80 in the <unk> .
A lot of it is a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
But it isn &apos;t over people who want us to , want this is a big thing .
Now , one of the things that was born today in New Delhi might be expected to live , as the rijkste man is in the world 100 years .
Think about it . It &apos;s a wonderful feit .
And why is it ?
And that smallpox . And that smallpox eradication , people have to be killed on this planet .
They had to be discovered that the Middle East has to be discovered in a different way .
They are gone . They are verdwenen .
We <unk> them . <unk> .
And in the world in the world , there were other kinds of diseases that we have to do for one another or a <unk> , not yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Does anybody know what it is ?
<unk> , modern <unk> , our vermogen , miljarden mensen , we &apos;re going to be <unk> ,
And in my view , this is the science tool , the other things , to remember , the way it is , the greatest verwezenlijkingen of human history .
That &apos;s the reason it &apos;s good news .
Now , that &apos;s all the reason that everybody has been out there , want er is some other problems , and they were <unk> ,
And one of them is that , in all of our world , we have a miljard people in all of us at this world at the moment ,
And this is the ratio , and they &apos;re getting very hard , and it is beschamend .
And not only that , we &apos;ve got to use our ability to use this world , this world is incredibly powerful .
drinkwater , <unk> land , violent , gas , gas , gas , to be out , and as we can &apos;t go out , and we &apos;re not going to be able to turn out of the chaos .
That &apos;s the question , &quot; Can we do it ? &quot;
I think it is clear that we can make food , who will be lost , who will be lost to miljard people , without the land .
I think , I think we can put this world with power , which doesn &apos;t make any sense .
I think that , and no , no , no , no , no ,
Now , here &apos;s my eye , and one of the things that night , that &apos;s one of the things that lie at night . We &apos;ve not done science , and not yet , not yet .
We couldn &apos;t be able to do it in that sense , and that &apos;s what we can do today .
We &apos;re in the middle of the amazing , amazing way that we look at it , and I think , in fact , that we have 100 , 300 years ago , that we &apos;ve been able to go back to the time , in which we have been <unk> , in that we &apos;re going to have to fight for vooruitgang in the era of things , in which we have been <unk> over those things , <unk> <unk> .
And those people <unk> up in their faith , and that &apos;s a scary way that you can &apos;t be bevrijd .
And not the reality that &apos;s going to be .
You know , you know , each one has a function of it , and it &apos;s a pretty good job to it .
You know , no , no ?
They have no <unk> of their own success . &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t .
And I &apos;ve spent a time talking ,
About 10 years ago , I &apos;ve been writing a paper on <unk> for &quot; The New Yorker , &quot;
And I was versteld , weerstand of suffering , weerstand against the suffering from , in fact , that &apos;s the most powerful thing that &apos;s present at the time in public health .
I didn &apos;t know , I was , I was , I &apos;ve got a paper , I &apos;ve been writing a paper ,
And all of the sudden I read a paper over <unk> ,
And it &apos;s just something , too .
They were <unk> .
And I &apos;ve also been writing a paper , and I didn &apos;t know why these people thought , &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they were thinking , &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they were in a way in a way in a way in a way in a way in the form of the nature of the natuur .
But you know , I am doing this . I &apos;ve been writing the artikel , I went .
I was journalist ,
We <unk> , we &apos;re missing , we &apos;re going to eat .
But this papers were me <unk> , and I didn &apos;t know why , and I think ,
And it &apos;s been because these <unk> , these <unk> , they didn &apos;t be <unk> .
These waren <unk> people , hoogopgeleide people , <unk> people .
They were like those people in this room .
And it was me this way ,
And then , I think , I think ,
We got a moment where we have no one at the time , which we had not dezelfde relatie .
We &apos;ve got to reason .
Well , we &apos;re very , very , very much , very small <unk> : &quot; Vooruitgang . &quot;
Okay , so here &apos;s the case , and I think we know what it is .
We have this vertrouwen in institutions , at the autoriteit , and soms in that science , and we have no <unk> , why not it should be .
And you can see just a few of these <unk> , and those people became understanding .
Chernobyl , <unk> , who <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> 2000 .
You know , you know , you can choose to vote .
<unk> and <unk> with people , whether we had to know that they had always right .
<unk> , desire , desire , desire .
You don &apos;t see it .
But if you look at this , if you want to make this bewijs , you have to think of this bewijs , and we &apos;re not good .
And I can tell you that we live in a world of fighting in the world , and I &apos;m not going to show you , and I won &apos;t see .
About 12 years ago , a single story , a very serious story , which was that the first time , who had this <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> studies have been done to see it ,
<unk> studies , it &apos;s a very , very famous deal .
And that data came out .
And that data came out from the United States , or in Engeland , or Canada , Canada , and they were all on it , no link , no link , no link ,
It doesn &apos;t make any difference . It doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we think , we think , is , we think , is what we &apos;re seeing , what we think , is what we really think ,
We don &apos;t think there is a set of <unk> paper , and we have a <unk> , die to us , and I think , I think , I think ,
You know ?
That was <unk> ,
<unk> roads , the United States is one of the world is one of the world in the world , in which he <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and we should be fooled .
It is vreselijk .
And what has happened is that we konden .
Well , I &apos;m <unk> .
Does anyone have <unk> ?
Only one of you in the audience , you know , you have to see somebody to live in <unk> ?
<unk> not much .
And in fact , in this country , in this country , there was no <unk> in the world ,
It &apos;s a long , <unk> , 20 dollars per hour .
And if you didn &apos;t see here , this is not what happens is , and people who were able to be <unk> , and people who were able to be <unk> , and some of the things that are called , &quot; <unk> and <unk> , &quot; and Larry King ,
And they can do it , because they don &apos;t connect to other people .
They don &apos;t know that the things that seem to be <unk> , but not the <unk> ,
And it &apos;s something we have to do , and it &apos;s very common .
This guy was a held , Jonas Salk .
There was one of the ergste <unk> of the human history .
Fear , no <unk> , no <unk> , <unk> ,
That guy in the midden in the midden is not very .
Paul <unk> ,
There has been a bunch of other people who have been developed a <unk> ,
There can be those in <unk> , 500,000 kinderen per jaar in the world ,
Pretty good , not ?
Now , that &apos;s a game , except for that , Paul <unk> , and over the other reason , and over vaccins , and to say , &quot; Well , you know , those of us have been <unk> . &quot;
And there it is .
Paul is a terrorist .
And when Paul in a <unk> <unk> praat , there can &apos;t be a <unk> of <unk> .
There have been telephone calls , because it &apos;s somebody saying to him , &quot; Well , that &apos;s what his kids have to do with school . &quot;
And why ? Because Paul has a vaccin .
I don &apos;t mean , I don &apos;t think , but it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> , and they are <unk> , and they are <unk> , and they are doing it .
We have in this country now .
And it gets more , and pretty soon , and pretty soon , his baby will stop , because it &apos;s only a question of the getallen .
They &apos;re not only going to be <unk> .
&quot; Well , what is it ? &quot;
A <unk> , one of several weken geleden , schreef me a couple of weeks ago , and I think they think I &apos;m becoming a bit ,
Nobody has you ooit .
She would not be <unk> by your baby <unk> . No .
<unk> .
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have <unk> . And you know ?
We had no <unk> in this country ,
Today , I &apos;m not going to go , and I &apos;m going to ask someone in Lagos in a way in a vliegtuig , and vliegt right now in front of New Year &apos;s Eve ,
And in some of the two hours , there are a auto , and it &apos;s going to come to Long Beach , and it &apos;s going to come to Long Beach , and there &apos;s one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there isn &apos;t , there is a <unk> ziekte to be obese , and we don &apos;t know it , want this is the world of the world .
This is the planeet waar we live . You don &apos;t be it , it &apos;s not the way it is .
We &apos;re going to love it , and we &apos;re going to love it .
Have you ever <unk> all your <unk> ?
<unk> , a small <unk> ,
And you know , you know , you know , you know , this half of American people have been doing that every single day .
They take that stuff , and they &apos;re different , and they do not make any difference , and they don &apos;t know why they &apos;re nutteloos .
That &apos;s what you want to do
They wash your urine . They don &apos;t do it fast .
It &apos;s okay , because it &apos;s going to be 28 miljard dollars for the outside of the outside .
I &apos;m right .
<unk> urine .
Why do we do ? Why do we do ?
Well , I &apos;m thinking , well , we &apos;re going to start with that <unk> .
We &apos;re going to work with a great workforce . We have no vertrouwen in this system .
We don &apos;t think of it . Our gezondheidssysteem is <unk> .
It is wreed to be with miljoenen people .
It &apos;s absolutely amazing to be incredibly cold , and <unk> to onszelf .
And we run out of road , and where are we running ?
We &apos;re running in those poor <unk> ,
It &apos;s great . I &apos;m <unk> .
But , you know , that &apos;s really , really , really , really , really , really , really , truly , and we &apos;re going to save miljarden dollars .
I am <unk> <unk> here .
<unk> , <unk> , trauma , <unk> , trauma , <unk> , because I don &apos;t know what it is , but we &apos;re going to steal miljarden dollars for this , it &apos;s been hurt .
And you know ? If I say , &quot; Oh , when I go , &quot;
They feel good . &quot;
And you know ? They had onecht .
Because of course , I &apos;m not sure it &apos;s the <unk> , the reason , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m not going to be able to pretend to be my experts in the same way &quot; or any of which <unk> , the patiënt , of course , die his patiënt behandelen .
If you go to this pad , and you see , what do you think and science , <unk> and political , you &apos;re going to see a situation ,
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> in Zuid-Afrika .
There were 400,000 of his people , because there was no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , much more effective as antiretroviral drugs , which we know about aids of AIDS .
And in fact , honderdduizenden <unk> are in a country , which is , as soon as any of that , more or less of all of this disease ,
Don &apos;t be able to do me not the consequenties .
They have them . They have them .
Now , that &apos;s the <unk> epidemie in which we have to be here , this crazy battle between the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> debat . You have to stop .
It is a real debat over words ,
It &apos;s that it &apos;s not important .
Everything , we were , every <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , and everybody &apos;s <unk> ,
You know , that he had no <unk> in the paradijs .
He had no <unk> , no <unk> , and we did everything .
We &apos;ve been doing it in those
Some of it has done and doesn &apos;t .
We <unk> , we didn &apos;t work .
And now we &apos;re going to be able to make it more . And we &apos;re <unk> , but we can do something in a way of putting some of them in rijst , and that can be miljoenen people , and miljoenen people ,
You don &apos;t ?
I have to say , I don &apos;t know .
We <unk> to <unk> food .
Why do we do ?
Now , what I &apos;m saying is , in fact , I &apos;m going to be , in a way , some of the tons , pesticiden , hormonen , <unk> , we &apos;re not going to be able to be very serious with it .
We don &apos;t want to be <unk> .
We &apos;re not going to be able to do that together .
And you know , what &apos;s my game ?
Yes , they got right .
We have a huge <unk> , but it &apos;s not science .
It has nothing to do with science .
Law , the moral , <unk> .
And you know , that was that that &apos;s not a single thing that is a business
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not a clue ; it is a proces .
And it is a proces , and soms , and soms , and not , and the idea , that we don &apos;t know the science , is that we don &apos;t know the science , want we are bang , want we hebben angst , want we hebben angst gekregen , en ze is miljoenen ,
In the next 50 years , we &apos;ve got 70 percent more food to transport 70 percent more food .
These are in Africa in the middle of 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
They do it , and we don &apos;t .
And why ? <unk> common food .
We don &apos;t want to encourage people to raise those <unk> , who are <unk> .
<unk> is something , it &apos;s a half miljard people .
It &apos;s like the aardappel .
It &apos;s a lot of sand . It &apos;s <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any of it , it doesn &apos;t make any of it , and the researchers are going to do it .
And the people who were willing to eten , were not blind .
They wouldn &apos;t verhongeren , and you know ?
It &apos;s okay . It &apos;s not <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s wrong .
And everything , I could say , &quot; Well , how do we respond ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; Well , how do we respond ? &quot;
Why don &apos;t we want to be <unk> ?
It doesn &apos;t have over Gene <unk> . It &apos;s not going to be chemicaliën .
It doesn &apos;t have to use our credit , our <unk> , how much food we care about , healthy food , <unk> food .
And it &apos;s not here over Rice <unk> , it &apos;s over , people in the world , and it &apos;s always the time , you know , what it is .
You know ?
If we don &apos;t do it , as we do , when we first , we &apos;re guilty of what we &apos;re doing , not guilty , high-tech kolonialisme .
He has no other <unk> for it .
And it &apos;s egoïstisch , it &apos;s not our fault , it &apos;s our no <unk> , and we really need it .
Now , to this very funny entertainment entertainment entertainment entertainment entertainment entertainment you want to say , &quot; I am going to be in this bizarre <unk> , and in that toekomst ? &quot;
In every case , I would speak .
At the moment , they &apos;re in the present , but we have a potential tool .
We can put this <unk> on everything ,
We can <unk> them , where we &apos;re going to be <unk> , and we &apos;re going to start to move .
We have to do this conversaties , and we have to think , but in that time , we &apos;re going to think , but in that time , we &apos;re going to be going to be happy , and we &apos;re going to be happy ,
I know that we can , and it is , in fact , to me , it is something that has been the world now .
Thank you . Thank you .
And when Steve <unk> , <unk> of the Los Angeles Times , on the streets , one in downtown Los Angeles , there was a wonderful piece of music .
And she came , or , to a man , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all the time , on a viool , who had only two <unk> .
And one of you know that , in fact , that , in fact , that , in fact , <unk> , there &apos;s been a book , that &apos;s been <unk> , by Robert <unk> , and Robert <unk> , and Jamie <unk> , and Jamie <unk> like Steve <unk> , who had been <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> , at the Juilliard , one <unk> , and 30 years later , there was <unk> and <unk> on the streets , <unk> Row ,
I &apos;m going to <unk> all of you , <unk> gelezen of the film , of the film , and that &apos;s the film , you know , to be able to understand that both of these first human being , which is to be built by both of those people who have been created this link , but it &apos;s the instrument that this link was the same thing that &apos;s the link , and that &apos;s the instrument , you know , that &apos;s the instrument , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of the
Mr. <unk> , in 2008 , two years , two jaar geleden , in the Walt Disney <unk> ,
There was just a show of performance , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and there was a <unk> ,
There was in a very <unk> , and <unk> sound over Yo-Yo Ma , and Hillary Clinton , and over the way , who had no <unk> in the baseball world , and all of the things that were <unk> , the <unk> passage of the eerste <unk> passage of <unk> <unk> .
and we &apos;ve got to talk about things , and some of the time later , I got a mail , which was , for me , was , <unk> me had been interested in me .
And I still have to say , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , want it was <unk> , want to be treated with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , trauma , that had all of his life .
And when it is , there &apos;s been very <unk> to those <unk> , and it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very powerful ,
And in fact , in fact , in a way , it was <unk> , as we met our first <unk> <unk> in the Walt Disney <unk> <unk> Hall , and there had this <unk> <unk> in his face , and had lost it .
and there was no way to put some live outfit and rook , and over , you know , who would be hurt ,
I was bang , not <unk> , but I was bang , that could be <unk> , and that could be <unk> in one of his <unk> , and that I could be able to <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , als I <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and other questions of the <unk> <unk> .
And I started to play .
I was in the middle of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And at the time , I realized , in fact , in <unk> , I think , in <unk> face ,
It was , as it was , when there was no way to the impact of the performance , the chemical reactie , which was my game .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , shock <unk> , in a tight nieuwsgierigheid and zacht .
And then , through a wonder , then there were a <unk> , and I began to get out of some of these clips , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
We began to talk about muziek , from Bach , all over Beethoven , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and all those other people , <unk> , all the rest of them ,
And I realized , well , no , no , no <unk> of expertise over music , but it has to be a scary band .
and there was , and I had to talk to you , and a lot of a lot , and a lot of my fellow in the <unk> of Los Angeles .
And door muziek , and over the muziek , and over on the other day , it was , in fact , his <unk> , <unk> man , <unk> man , who was right , in front of Los Angeles , <unk> , <unk> , at the age of <unk> .
Muziek is organic . It is the way .
For <unk> , music is <unk> .
because that &apos;s the idea of putting it out , and his thoughts and <unk> with your ability to verbeelding and creativiteit ,
And so , again , there are <unk> <unk> .
and I know that this is the real nature of the art .
And that &apos;s why this is the issue , why we &apos;re going to do this , is that we &apos;re in all of us , diep vanbinnen , our gevoelens , through our ability to create our artistieke lens , through our creativiteit .
And that &apos;s the fact that this <unk> is all of us , and it , geïnspireerd , inspireren us .
And what <unk> did , that &apos;s the way it &apos;s muziek , and that &apos;s in a community of family members .
And that <unk> , the <unk> of the music , bracht hem into a different way , or , who had the sense of God , who had to know his talent , and it <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to go through <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to be in the Walt Disney <unk> of Disney <unk> Hall , and in <unk> Row , there &apos;s been something to me .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Thanks very much .
Robert Gupta .
Robert Gupta : I &apos;m going to play something , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be sorry .
I &apos;m Jane <unk> . I design games .
So , I &apos;ve been developing 10 years of <unk> , and my goal is for the next decade , it &apos;s the same way that the world is in the world in <unk> , who &apos;s in <unk> , who &apos;s in <unk> .
I have a plan . I want to be more and more , as you all know , how much more you want to do , how much more fun it is for the games and <unk> games .
And at this time , we &apos;re going to put three miljard of a week at home .
Some of you might think , &quot; That &apos;s a whole bunch of days of games . &quot;
A lot of time , when you think about who we think , I think , we &apos;re going to really need to solve the real world in real time .
And , in fact , , my research on the Institute for that toekomst , is the way it is , exactly the way it is ,
And three biljoen uur per week , not genoeg , half genoeg , over the world of the world .
And in fact , I think , when we &apos;re going to overleven the next eeuw we &apos;re going to continue to change the world , we &apos;re going to change the world dramatically .
I have to berekenen , at 21 , 21 miljard uren <unk> per week .
Now , it &apos;s the first thing that I think about , and I &apos;ve been doing it , and I think it is , als we , als we , how , if we were buying ourselves , to create armoede , global , global conflicten , global conflicten , global conflicten , global conflict , and we &apos;re going to start thinking , &quot; Well , maybe we &apos;re going to play games online for 21 miljard dollars per week . &quot;
and at the end of the decade , the next thing , I didn &apos;t know .
Well , why ? This is a picture of it .
And why I think , is that games have to think about the survival of human species in the future .
This is a research student of fotograaf <unk> <unk> .
There was one of the other words in the game . And then there &apos;s a camera built a camera .
This is one of the klassieke <unk> .
If you &apos;re not going to be there , you might not see some of the nuances in this picture .
And you probably think of the idea of urgentie , which is , you know , angst , but <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
If you &apos;re going to play , there are some of these nuances here , who look at the top of <unk> eyes , and the dog is a sound of optimisme .
This is one of them , on the rand of a so-called <unk> ,
Oh , you know . Okay . Great .
We have some numbers here .
Now , there &apos;s a <unk> overwinning , it &apos;s a product that &apos;s incredibly positief , you know , that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible .
It was <unk> over the way . And when you get it , it &apos;s been hurt ,
You know , you know , you know , this is a <unk> overwinning .
This one of those gamers is a <unk> overwinning .
And this is what we have to do with miljoenen gezichten in the world over the world , als we these <unk> of the next eeuw we &apos;re going into the <unk> of the next <unk> on the rand of a <unk> ,
And , you know , this is what we &apos;re seeing in real life in real life , as we &apos;re going to see tough trouble .
I &apos;m turning it into the &quot; In Life , &quot;
And it &apos;s my gezicht ,
And that &apos;s what I do , who I am &quot; in Life , &quot;
This is a graffiti video in my home in Berkeley , California , where I studied in my Ph.D. in my game in games ,
This is a problem , it &apos;s a lot of it .
We think we &apos;re in the real world in the world in games .
And I didn &apos;t know just not , well , I think it &apos;s okay .
We are in <unk> .
I mean , I have my good job in the context of the poetry , geïnspireerd door it .
When we &apos;re in a field , I think that fate is in our <unk> , I think , in fact , that we &apos;re going to open up in our best , <unk> , <unk> , to the problem , that it &apos;s going to work on , it &apos;s going to be , after the <unk> ,
And in the sense , when we &apos;re not going to falen , when we <unk> it , we tend to think differently .
And we feel compelled to us . We &apos;ve got to think of it . We &apos;re going to be more bedreigd , it might be more depressief , and more , gefrustreerd .
We don &apos;t have one of those kinds of things that we &apos;re playing games , in games , they don &apos;t .
And it was , in fact , <unk> ,
And why is it in games to think , to think , to think , can &apos;t be anything ?
Who can combine those gevoelens in the world ?
And I &apos;m thinking of games who World of Warcraft and Warcraft in , trying to be an ideal ,
And I &apos;ve noticed some things that epic epic <unk> in <unk> as well .
Ten , as you start in one of those <unk> , the world of World of Warcraft , has a lot of different kinds of characters , who are bereid to be a <unk> missie , and it &apos;s a <unk> Mission ,
But no , no , no , no mission , it &apos;s a mission , which is perfect in advance in the game , right ?
You see it .
They &apos;re never going to be a job , not you know .
But on the way , on the way , you &apos;ve got to put together .
And he &apos;s not in World of World of Warcraft . You don &apos;t have to be around it , and <unk> , and it &apos;s all really important to do it .
And he <unk> <unk> .
And what you &apos;re going to do is , you know , honderdduizenden people , who are with you , you know , have to be your epic missie ,
And this is what we did in real life in real life , and that gevoel , that in a way , a <unk> <unk> of Hollywood .
And this is another epic geschiedenis , this <unk> verhaal , that we &apos;re here , and we &apos;re going to have to do this , and we &apos;re going to have to do this all the positive feedback .
They set up with &quot; high level high , &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; , &quot; + 1 <unk> &quot; ,
This constant feedback has no real feedback in real life .
As I go out , I don &apos;t know , &quot; + 1 , <unk> , + 1 <unk> , + 20 <unk> idee . &quot;
I &apos;m not going to stop this feedback .
Now , the problem of the Internet , who World of Warcraft , is that it makes sense , at the time , at the moment , at the time , at the moment , at the end of a <unk> <unk> , that we &apos;re going to use all of our time in this world .
They &apos;re like the real world .
And at all , all the World or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> miljoen jaar , that we &apos;ve been able to put together these virtuele problemen .
It &apos;s not a lot of things .
It might be <unk> .
But in the context of the context , <unk> miljoen jaar geleden , our <unk> came out .
That &apos;s the same <unk> .
Okay , as we first reason , when we first , we &apos;re going to put together a lot of time right now , is that when you look at the time it is , you know , when you look at it at that point in terms of the perspective of human evolution , what &apos;s really important .
But it is a lot of it . We &apos;re going to be able to use all of the time in the game , what we &apos;re going to do , is what we can do als people in the position of things .
We &apos;re going to be called <unk> , <unk> .
That &apos;s the truth . I &apos;m going to be here .
Now , if you look at this interesting statistiek , that &apos;s a study that &apos;s been presented by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University , which is the gemiddelde person in a country at a time , with a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
There is a very , very interesting , very interesting , very important getal ,
Ten eerste , in the United States , <unk> the <unk> of the middelbare school that they live in school , whether they &apos;re in high school , whether it &apos;s high school in high school , the High School of High School .
<unk> , on the age of five , and it &apos;s a bunch of things , it &apos;s a bunch of different things to be , all the other things , all of you in school .
And maybe some of you have some of you who had the nieuw book of Malcolm Gladwell , &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> , &quot; you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the theorie of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the human being .
It is gebaseerd on the great R &amp; amp ; <unk> , als we 10,000 uur rijden met het bestuderen van <unk> , of we gaan met het <unk> van het <unk> .
We were getting so good in , who are the most powerful people in the world .
And here we have a whole bunch of people who are <unk> , who are <unk> .
And that &apos;s the big question , &quot; Well , exactly the same thing is <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
because when we could think of it , we did not know how far we had <unk> human potential .
Zoveel people have been in the world today , which is , at least one of a sudden , a dollar per day .
These are our <unk> , 500 million people , who are very good at &quot; something &quot; .
And in the next decade , we have another miljard gamers , which were very much good at it .
If you don &apos;t have it ,
Those are <unk> , who have been <unk> , who save the power , and on <unk> , in order to use it over the world in the world , in fact , in the world , China , in fact , in India , China , Brazilië .
You know , you &apos;re going to want to look at it in the next decade .
And we &apos;ve got 1.5 miljard gamers .
And I &apos;ve started to figure out , well , what &apos;s it , what we &apos;re going to call this games ,
And here it is four things that I found . Ten eerste : <unk> .
Okay , you know it &apos;s very extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the drang , direct things to be done , a horde of it , where we &apos;re going to be able to deal with a <unk> ,
And gamers say , &quot; Well , that &apos;s a <unk> overwinning possible , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> , and it &apos;s something that &apos;s going on .
Speler no .
gamers are <unk> in the <unk> of social networking .
And it &apos;s a lot more interesting to us , that we want to make people care about it , when we &apos;ve got it , when we &apos;ve had some of them , when they &apos;ve been <unk> ,
The issue is , it &apos;s a huge vertrouwen to play with somebody to play a game .
We vertrouwen erop to us , and we &apos;re going to think that those rules have been <unk> , that we &apos;ve got a lot of sense , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
And this is what &apos;s called <unk> , which is , through emotion , vertrouwen and samenwerking .
And by the way , we build organic social relaties .
<unk> . Fantastic !
And , you know , you know , that &apos;s why the <unk> , <unk> 22 uur per week is <unk> ,
The issue is , when we &apos;re going to play , we &apos;re alive , when we &apos;re going to work , when we &apos;re ontspannen , when we &apos;re ontspannen .
We know that we think as human beings <unk> , als we really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , a lot of money ,
And spelers are always bereid to work , when they get the real job .
And there are <unk> .
speler <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , here &apos;s a <unk> , here &apos;s the <unk> , and you know , all Wikipedia , the world &apos;s biggest <unk> of the world .
The economy in the world &apos;s economy , with fast 80,000 <unk> , is the World of Warcraft .
Five hundred million people use it .
They have more informatie of World of World of Warcraft in the Internet , and over any other world in every other world in the world .
They &apos;re <unk> alien .
They &apos;re going to be a epic bron of understanding the World of Warcraft .
Okay , it &apos;s four <unk> , who have to put one of you in a single outcome . gamers are <unk> , <unk> individuen .
It is people , who think , who think , that they can think of the world .
And the problem is , in fact , is that they can think of the virtuele werelden , but not that real .
It &apos;s the problem , that I &apos;m going to be here .
Edward <unk> is a <unk> .
Your job is awesome .
People as well , people and money and money in <unk> .
And there says , &quot; Well , we &apos;re getuigen or no <unk> as a <unk> in virtual world and <unk> . &quot;
And it &apos;s a economist . There makes sense .
And there is , no , no , no , no , I design games ,
And there it is , it makes sense sense , want gamers can be more in <unk> as in real life .
They &apos;re in the form of sterkere band , when in real time in real life , they get more feedback and beloning in games as in real time .
And there it is , in fact , this makes perfect sense , in the virtual world in the real world .
I &apos;m just going to start to make sense .
but it &apos;s absolutely no <unk> .
We have to start with the real world in a game
My inspiratie komt , or two , 2,500 years ,
And this is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> ,
For some of these amazing things , it was <unk> .
And it was , in fact , that people were <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and if you look at the old man of the oude Griekse <unk> <unk> , you know , maybe this verhaal , you know , and that &apos;s what games were uitgevonden .
Laut <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in Eastern Europe , <unk> <unk> .
And he said , &quot; Well , this is a great hongersnood , that the koning of God &apos;s <unk> ,
People had <unk> . Those people vochten .
It was a very extreme way . We had a very extreme tool .
And it &apos;s called , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the next day , you would play .
And they were very , very , very <unk> to be <unk> , so that games are so fascinerend , and we have to put together with <unk> , <unk> , that they were going to fail .
And then , the next day , you were playing . And the next day , the next day .
And <unk> , for 18 years , this hongersnood for 18 years , they were <unk> , and in the following year .
You know , I think we &apos;re going to play games .
We put games together , over the lijden of the echte wereld , we &apos;re putting games in the real world , and we &apos;re going to put things in the real world , that in the real world of real life , and we make it in real life , and we make it easier .
It doesn &apos;t have to be done .
It &apos;s the <unk> .
According to 45 years , I didn &apos;t make it so much . And the koning , one of the <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> ,
They verdeelden the koninkrijk in half .
They were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> to a <unk> avontuur .
They were <unk> , and we were going to set up on the way to live , on the way , and it was , net as he was , to make it out , who had to go back to life , and it were <unk> to the rest of it .
That &apos;s gek , or ?
But Recent research shows that those <unk> , that those <unk> , who were later the <unk> Reich , who had this age of old <unk> ,
And then , recent , wetenschappers were asked to be the concept that <unk> is really .
And geologen vonden to a global <unk> , which had been nearly 20 years , who had been able to tell that Japanese hongersnood ,
And this is a <unk> story .
And , misschien , in fact , they had people gered by making 18 jaar in games for 18 years in games , and die <unk> , and die <unk> , and we &apos;ve got to think about it as a game game ,
We can do it .
So we &apos;re going to start off of World of Warcraft .
And it was the biggest <unk> in real time in real time .
The World of <unk> . It &apos;s 16 years old .
They were 18 <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to start this 16 years ,
I want to be honest with our <unk> game .
And , in fact , , the other way of using their <unk> up to a new world , I &apos;m going to ask my 21 miljard <unk> <unk> per week .
We &apos;ve got to put together , that the helft of us spend a half of a time playing game , and we &apos;re going to try to match up with the real world .
I mean , I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; Well , how lossen we up ?
And in games ? &quot; And this is where I &apos;ve been my job in the world at the National Institute of Medicine .
We &apos;ve got this <unk> in our kantoor in Palo Alto , and it breaks down who we think of the toekomst .
We &apos;re not going to work on the way to the toekomst .
What we &apos;re going to do , is that &apos;s the toekomst .
We &apos;re going to think that we &apos;re going to be the best , and people are going to <unk> this idea in that way .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re going to have to do it .
And I &apos;m going to show you three games , which I have to do , in fact , people epic epic <unk> in their own future .
This is &quot; world without olie . &quot;
The game is in 2007 .
It &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And it &apos;s been , that &apos;s , you know , <unk> is , but we &apos;ve got a lot of power , and it &apos;s really , really , really , really , really , really , really , truly , in real life , and if you &apos;re going to open up , you know , what you &apos;re going to see . And in real time , what you &apos;ve got is , you know , how much gas is going to be in real time , that &apos;s how he &apos;s <unk> , which is
Who &apos;s <unk> , of course , his education is closed off of the way . And you have to be able to figure out how to make your real life , and you &apos;ve got to figure out how to make your life , and we &apos;re asking , &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
We &apos;ve done this game in 2007 in 2007 , and we &apos;ve got them all the next three years .
And I can tell you , it was a different time .
Nobody &apos;s going to change its life , because it &apos;s good for that of that milieu , of course .
But in a way , when you look at it in a school , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to turn out the olie . &quot;
This is an incredibly important avontuur ,
And remember , you know , how many of us are going to overleven . Those of our gamers have <unk> gewoontes .
So , we &apos;ve got to use the next <unk> game , much more , much more generally .
We &apos;ve got this game called &quot; <unk> &quot; on the Institute for that toekomst .
Back then , that &apos;s the reason of a <unk> , that these people have only 23 500 years on the planet .
This supercomputer heet &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; ,
The answer of gamers , <unk> , have been <unk> , we &apos;ve got to call &quot; <unk> &quot; .
You know , you know , you know , Jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot; And you have some intense astronauten , the wetenschappers , the <unk> , and they can be the world redden .
But in our game , in the way , or five people , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; Well , everybody &apos;s in the world , and it is our job , the toekomst , the future , veiligheid , veiligheid , and that &apos;s the toekomst of the sociale rechtvaardigheid .
8,000 spelers speelden a game for eight years .
They were made 500 incredibly creatieve questions , which you could read , als &quot; <unk> &quot; .
And the final game , we &apos;re going to see it at 3 maart . It &apos;s a game in samenwerking with the Wereldbank .
If you finish the game , you get from the Wereldbank who <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , 2010 .
We &apos;ve been working with universiteiten in Sub-Saharan Africa , and nodigen them up , social networking ,
We have a strip strip . We have high level high , <unk> , <unk> , duurzaamheid , Vision and vindingrijkheid .
I want jullie to ask all of this game , all over the world , over the world , over the world , vooral in <unk> , to be able to introduce any of these online designers , over the world .
I &apos;m going to end up .
I &apos;m going to ask you .
You know , what happened ?
We &apos;ve got all the amazing gamers , we have games , that we &apos;re going to be able to be , but we did not make the real world ,
Well , I think , I &apos;m going to be out there , that there is no way to put any human resources on human resources , which we can use in real life in real life , and that games have a lot of important value for verandering .
We &apos;ve got all these <unk> , <unk> , who can be scary to be scary to be scary , <unk> , <unk> , and the purpose of purpose .
And I &apos;m going to do that , in fact , we &apos;re going to play a lot of good games , over the world , in this world ,
And I &apos;m going to happen , you know , playing games and play .
As I look at the next decade , I &apos;m going to look at two things : &quot; I think we &apos;re going to be able to be able to create a <unk> toekomst , and that we can make all kinds of games . &quot;
Thank you .
For some time , I &apos;m going to be interested in the <unk> , and it seems to be <unk> to me as being some tovenaar is geïnteresseerd in what I think when I think , &quot; Well , that &apos;s the AI that makes something more difficult , als iemand gewoon hard genoeg is . &quot;
And other words , <unk> in some studies , have a <unk> effect , which is a <unk> effect , the <unk> , and it &apos;s only because of it , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> of it , a <unk> of it , and it is , als the patiënt , out of it , a <unk> effect in the body , which he <unk> , which is a <unk> effect in the body , which is the <unk> effect in the body .
Now , the AI &apos;s got to be something , because of it .
Now , we know each other , I &apos;m going to ask you , I &apos;m going to ask you a little , very simple , very simple
And I &apos;m going to show you , who &apos;s going to work . This is a trick , ten minste sinds the vijftiger jaren , of what &apos;s going on in every family of course .
I &apos;ve got to introduce them through the <unk> <unk> in the &apos; 70s .
I &apos;m going to put it up , and then the answer then .
And then I get to uitleggen .
And you see , you know ,
And the messen that you can go , my hand , my hand ,
I &apos;m going to put the messen in my hand .
I <unk> my mouw .
And in order to make sure that nothing in my face goes out of my face , I &apos;m going to touch my pols ,
And you can see , at this point , at no time , no , no , no , no , no in my mouw , I can &apos;t walk into my face .
And this is a very simple way .
I open my hand , and hopelijk , when everything comes out , the mes through my body , it &apos;s the way to my body .
It &apos;s got to be so close to where I can schudden , without the messen .
No , no , no <unk> of my face , no <unk> , no <unk> .
<unk> !
Now , this is a truc , which I <unk> , which is a lot of good kind of <unk> , that &apos;s a lot of fun , want to learn more about autism , when you look at it , it &apos;s a very simple way of thinking of it , as a very simple stunt .
I probably know one of you here in this room .
You know ?
I hold the messen in my hand .
I say , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to <unk> my pols <unk> , and I &apos;m going to stop it in my face , and it &apos;s a leugen of it .
That &apos;s why I <unk> my pols , is that in fact , that &apos;s the string of the illusie of the illusie .
And at the time , when I get my hand out of my hand , I &apos;m going to show them where they &apos;re here , my <unk> , my <unk> , where there is , in a way , where there is , in a way , in a position , in a position ,
<unk> ?
That &apos;s where you got somebody who had no kindertijd .
And here it is . Right .
And als I <unk> , the object of my mind ,
And now , you know why this is a <unk> , why don &apos;t you see that here is drie vingers to be here , because of the mind , and that sense , and that sense of how it is informatie , it doesn &apos;t matter to each other , one , two , three , but it &apos;s a , two , three ,
But it &apos;s not exactly the way here . And open my hand .
And it &apos;s the way it &apos;s taken out , but it &apos;s not through the measure of my body , but through my <unk> , it &apos;s my <unk> ,
And when I put my hand in my hand , I think I &apos;m going to be <unk> , through this movement , is that the object is hidden away .
I take this hand away . And here is the messen .
This is the way you can even show your vrienden and buurman . Thanks .
Well , what has it got to do with it ?
For a while , I read a studie , I read a studie , die me really had <unk> .
I &apos;m not a arts and research , and that &apos;s why I was an amazing thing .
And that &apos;s what it says : als je a placebo in the form of a witte pil aanbieden , in the form of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a run , a <unk> , witte pil , who had a specifiek effect .
But in the same sense , in the same way , the placebo , you know , in a smaller pil , and the sound of color , and the sound of color , and a letter of <unk> ,
And it , hoewel no any of it is any of it , it &apos;s just a <unk> ,
but a guy who &apos;s a guy who &apos;s not as well as a blauwe button .
What ? It got me <unk> .
It was , but it &apos;s not all the stuff .
As a matter of <unk> , it &apos;s the way to be more effectiever as a <unk> .
An gekleurde capsule , die on top of a while , is a very , very white capsule , as a white capsule .
And the way that <unk> is a matter of fact .
A pil of a table is not very good at no one who had three pillen -- I &apos;m not going to remind you of it .
That &apos;s the truth ,
that it &apos;s going to be a matter of fact .
And that &apos;s the shape of the form .
And als je the ultieme <unk> wil , moet je down to the naald .
Right ? A <unk> with some of a <unk> , a few <unk> of a <unk> object , that male fibers .
It &apos;s a very , very nice picture in mind . It &apos;s very much sterker as a blanke guy .
Now this graphics here , I &apos;m going to show you a different time , as we have a <unk> .
And you know , that guy who doesn &apos;t sound so good to be the white guy who doesn &apos;t sound like the white guy , who doesn &apos;t sound like a capsule , who doesn &apos;t sound like the naald .
And no , no one of it has a <unk> eigenschap , and it &apos;s only our belief that we get into the trigger .
I wanted to know how to use this idea for a different way .
I guess I &apos;m going to make a superintelligent , and it &apos;s really going to be really .
We know yes , you know , you &apos;ve got to take the naald of the naald when it &apos;s going to be .
This is 18 inches long , long , very , very , very , very , very much <unk> .
It &apos;s really my vlees . It &apos;s not <unk> <unk> .
This is my huid . It &apos;s not Hollywood Hollywood .
I &apos;m going to put this naald in my body right now , and through it , through it , through it on the other side .
If you look straight in the <unk> -- when you fall down in the <unk> -- I &apos;ve got a couple of vrienden at the hotelkamer , and there are some of the people die I didn &apos;t know , and some of my people , I &apos;ve become <unk> .
Now , I <unk> , when you look at the word , the next half of the time , you go out of the next 30 seconden , Of course , you know , I &apos;m going to be the eerste <unk> here .
They can even see it , but you can be <unk> ,
And here , right here , right here , when my first piece of my arm starts off my arm , I &apos;m just going to be a little <unk> .
Doesn &apos;t really care . Is that gek ?
And a little bit of my huid , and on the other side , and on the other side ,
And now we &apos;re in dezelfde context , which we had when we had <unk> .
Right .
Now , can &apos;t you take my fingers , or ?
So , here &apos;s the one , two , three , four , five .
Yeah .
I know what people think , when they think .
And you say , &quot; OK , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the idea is , &quot; OK , that &apos;s a bit of the huid , just for a while , a lot of a lot of a while . &quot;
Well , I &apos;ll show you .
Who here ? Pretty good .
Yes , I know . And people turn out to say , &quot; OK . I didn &apos;t see it . &quot;
They &apos;re going to put people in the lab .
I want to leave you with me .
It &apos;s my huid . It &apos;s not Hollywood Hollywood .
It &apos;s my vlees , and I can do it .
Sorry . If you look lelijk , you look away ,
That people achterin , and that , later on , would say , &quot; Well , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , that &apos;s going to look straight , but if it &apos;s really , it &apos;s a hole , you know , this is a gat , and it &apos;s a hole , and it is , you know , this is a gat , and he &apos;s going to be . &quot;
OK , let me even be a bit of blood sugar .
Yeah , here it is .
Now , I &apos;m going to go down the naald .
I would hold my arm , and you know , that there is no <unk> .
But I think , in this context , here , and the object , I think , in fact , whether it &apos;s going to be <unk> , I &apos;m going to stop the naald , and it &apos;s going to be .
We &apos;re going to be here in the next few days .
I &apos;m going to ask you , yes . Thanks very much .
I have in my life in my life in my life .
I had two of them .
This one , it was more like a gepassioneerde <unk> .
It was an interesting vis , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a bestseller on the surface .
What &apos;s a vis .
And even better , there was in <unk> to <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve got to think of it .
I had a relatie with this one of the two maanden .
And one day , the President of the bedrijf , and I said , &quot; Well , I would come up with some of the <unk> of the boerderij .
&quot; Well , &quot; I said .
And this is a business , who had been taken out of this unprecedented probleem , has this unprecedented probleem for our chefs . Who &apos;s going to stand up for us ?
And in the afgelopen 50 years , we &apos;ve got that <unk> up who we run out of banks ,
It &apos;s very hard to protect it .
90 percent of the big fish , die that we houden , that &apos;s where gravity is , these <unk> , who are <unk> , these <unk> , they &apos;re ingestort .
It &apos;s fast nothing .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , some of our toekomst .
And there are plenty of argument . <unk> vervuilen that the environment , and they &apos;re inefficiënt , and they &apos;re inefficiënt , they &apos;re very much better .
There &apos;s a <unk> of 15 to 1 .
It &apos;s , you know , 15 pond <unk> , you &apos;ve got to raise a kilo <unk> .
not very much .
Very good , not very good .
And this was a really , a business , who probeerde it .
And I was <unk> .
On the day , I would call the President of the <unk> of <unk> .
We call it Don .
&quot; Don &quot; , I said , &quot; Well , you know , &quot; Well , you know , &quot; Well , you know , you know , that &apos;s beroemd for us in the ocean , that &apos;s the way that it is not vervuild water . &quot;
&quot; Well , this is where , &quot; there are . &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re so high , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to be here , that is rid of our vis , not geconcentreerd . &quot;
And then there goes , &quot; Well , we &apos;re in nature .
They put one of 2.5 billion dollars one ,
&quot; That best in that sector . &quot;
2.5 million .
&quot; 2.5 are one ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> proteïnen &quot; ,
&quot; Good , &quot; I said .
And on that night , I was lying in bed , and I think , &quot; What is a big deal ? &quot;
I am the next day , the next day , the next thing , I don &apos;t know .
And I said , &quot; Don , was there are <unk> proteïnen ? &quot;
And there &apos;s no way of doing it , there &apos;s no way .
Well , I went out with some of my people in the world , and no one could be taught me a question , and I didn &apos;t know how to deal with the early arts ,
We &apos;re not going to call it .
&quot; Don &quot; , I said , &quot; Well , what were we like ?
Well , there had some algen , and some of it <unk> , and there , <unk> ,
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
And there was , &quot; Yes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Who am <unk> <unk> <unk> is kip ? &quot;
or maybe two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s 30 percent , &quot;
And I said , &quot; Don , was this is going to be a bit better , the <unk> of the vissen ? &quot;
And it was a long pause , in the middle of the board , and there he said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s a way too much . &quot;
I &apos;m going to <unk> ,
No , no , no , no , no <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
And I didn &apos;t know , I &apos;m <unk> by this vis , because , I know God , I &apos;m going to damage God , who had this game to be called <unk> .
And this is a different solution , it &apos;s a different type of energy .
That &apos;s the romantic way , which , in fact , , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the vis , you know , the vis makes more and more of it .
I &apos;m also going to put this in a restaurant in a restaurant at risk ,
A <unk> journalist had to talk a long journalist ,
It &apos;s got us in a way ,
And there was on the tafel , with a very lichte named <unk> ,
And the chef-kok had this .
<unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s still heerlijk .
How can you get to make a fish look like this , when it &apos;s sold ?
I can &apos;t do it , but this guy can .
We call it Miguel . It &apos;s Miguel .
And no , no one bought the vis , and there isn &apos;t a chef . It &apos;s not going to be .
There &apos;s a man at <unk> La <unk> .
This is one of a <unk> in the south of the Sahara .
It &apos;s close to the bottom of the stream of banks .
and at that &apos; 80s , that &apos;s the California supply chain .
You were <unk> <unk> , in fact , in fact ,
They were doing this , by the way ,
And they were built this ingewikkelde suite of <unk> , and they <unk> water out of the country , and then in the local community .
They didn &apos;t make sense , that it didn &apos;t work ,
And it was a ramp ,
And it has to be 90 percent of the colony , and there were many people who are <unk> ,
And this is a guy called 1982 , which was called this country ,
What did you do ?
They have the water of the water .
They have a <unk> <unk> .
And in plaats van the water <unk> , they were flying these kanalen ,
They <unk> these kanalen .
You &apos;ve got to build a bunch of 11,000 hectaren <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . , etc .
That &apos;s a lot of it .
I &apos;ve never seen it again .
They &apos;re staring at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all of it was <unk> <unk> , and this dense , <unk> mars .
I was no longer with Miguel .
There &apos;s a lot of man , three of them , Charles Darwin , and a piece of &quot; A <unk> &quot; ,
Okay ? And so , we were , and we were fighting through those <unk> , and I <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and Miguel , and Miguel ,
Here &apos;s one of a zeldzame <unk> .
And there it is , it &apos;s the environmental damage .
And here , here &apos;s a figure , here you look at it on these <unk> giraffe ,
And it turns out that Miguel , though , is the largest part of all of his <unk> in Africa in Africa .
I was going to ask them , who had to become a <unk> ,
And there was , &quot; vis ? I don &apos;t know fish .
I &apos;m an expert on relaties . &quot;
And then there is , and it goes into more and more and more and less and algen and algen and <unk> .
And I don &apos;t believe me verkeerd , that &apos;s really fascinerend , that &apos;s what you see , that this is a <unk> environment ,
It &apos;s great , but I was <unk> .
And my problem is , very , very zwak about this , through this ticket , <unk> <unk> ,
And I didn &apos;t get it down . And I said , &quot; Miguel , who komt out of it , is that you know how to suck it up ? &quot;
And there &apos;s been to those algen .
&quot; I know , ah , kind of , the algen , the fytoplankton , that &apos;s the environment , it &apos;s unbelievable .
What was drinking you vis ?
Who &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
Well , I want to say , &quot; Well , let &apos;s say , this is a <unk> system , that the vissen were drinking , in the wild .
And these <unk> biomassa , the fytoplankton , the <unk> , that it &apos;s the fish .
The system is so gezond , it is completely <unk> .
There is no family .
You know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t get to see their homes .
And later , on this site , I went out on this site on this site , and I looked at it , I said , &quot; Well , you know , &quot; Well , you know , &quot; Well , you know , the way you want to be , &quot; &quot; Who <unk> you ? &quot;
And at the moment , it was , as a consequence , had to have a <unk> <unk> ,
And we arcs that in that hoek , and we were seeing this incredible thing , and we &apos;re going to see that this is a solid , duizenden and <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s a completely <unk> tapijt .
&quot; This is great , &quot;
&quot; Look , you see their <unk> , they have a little bit of a bug .
They <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? I was very upset .
And I said , &quot; Miguel , don &apos;t you see fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot;
&quot; We lost 20 percent of our vis and <unk> to those Birds .
And , in fact , , in fact , there were 600.000 vogels in this country , like 250 different kinds of things .
That &apos;s the world , and one of the world &apos;s largest <unk> in Europe .
And I said , &quot; Miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> , not the first thing , that &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to do in a box ,
There are no <unk> , no .
And there was , &quot; Well , we &apos;re <unk> , not high . &quot;
This is a <unk> netwerk .
They got to eat these <unk> .
Those of us were drinking the fytoplankton .
And you <unk> the buik of the inner world . &quot;
Okay , let &apos;s think about it again . A boerderij , who &apos;s not going to waste their homes and a boerderij , who &apos;s going to affect its gezondheid of its <unk> .
<unk> , but it &apos;s also a <unk> .
Oh , and this is one of these <unk> , and that &apos;s not going to be here .
They &apos;re going to open up in a town of 240 miles away , where it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
Every morning they &apos;re going to lower 240 miles .
Every night they &apos;re going to go down 240 miles .
They do this , because they can be able to go through the witte lijn of <unk> <unk> .
Serieus .
I had to be a very , very <unk> of the pinguïns , and I looked at Miguel .
And I said , &quot; Well , &quot; Miguel , do they have 240 miles of the boerderij , and then they &apos;re going to have 240 miles away ?
Do they do ? &quot;
And it looked me , like I had a song or the Whitney Houston .
And there said , &quot; No . You do it , because it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
I didn &apos;t have the huid of my geliefde blue fish , which was heerlijk , and I can &apos;t be <unk> . I can &apos;t get them out of my way .
This is a drug called <unk> .
I &apos;m never going to stop .
And yet , if I put in this restaurant in this restaurant in <unk> , they didn &apos;t look at it .
It makes zoet and flow , as you walk out of the oceaan .
I was saying it versus Miguel and <unk> .
And there was , &quot; That huid works like a <unk> . &quot;
And it &apos;s the burden of the burden on something in that area .
You &apos;ve evolved in the evolutie , over the world , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And then there goes , &quot; Well , our water has no <unk> . &quot;
Okay . An Farm , who are not feeding its fish . An Farm , which is its succes to succes .
And then , when there &apos;s a fish , I think , when there &apos;s a boerderij that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , it &apos;s hard , because the water , it &apos;s the water that &apos;s going to come out of the stream of the stream .
It &apos;s a stream , that all these things that have been doing with it , whether it &apos;s going to <unk> , they &apos;re going to have to do with it , chemical sensors , <unk> ,
And when it &apos;s taken out of the system , and this is where it is , the water is clean , as it is , is the water of it .
The system is so gezond , it produces the water .
And no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , that &apos;s what is going to value its value to the gezondheid of its <unk> , but it &apos;s a boerderij that you know , not only about the fish , it &apos;s not just the fish , not only for you .
because when the water tank , it &apos;s in the Atlantic .
A druppel in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;m going to do it , and I think , and this is what <unk> , who romantic , who romantic , who romantic ook ,
and you might be able to say , &quot; Well , that &apos;s a <unk> of the toekomst of food , and we &apos;re going to talk to you , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;re <unk> .
Now , what we have is , is a radicaal nieuw concept of landbouw , whether it actually makes a difference in our food ,
But for many people , it &apos;s a bit radicaal .
We &apos;re not <unk> , we <unk> . We &apos;re fat .
We &apos;re going to love <unk> . We houden up little <unk> . We &apos;re talking about regional food ,
And when you think about that , that &apos;s that the things that are out there , that &apos;s where the future of food is coming out , and say , &quot; Hey , people , I &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but how did you make that world feed ?
Who were the world feed ? &quot;
Is really cool ?
I can &apos;t ask this question .
No , no , no , no , no , no <unk> of calorieën for that world .
A miljard people become <unk> .
A miljard -- it &apos;s more if you look at it -- in terms of environmental issues in those of countries , not the <unk> .
Well , I &apos;m not allowed to ask this question , because they have the concept of our <unk> that we have to deal with .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , an <unk> , <unk> of the Earth , the nuclear waste of the Earth , and that &apos;s all the time that we <unk> it , &quot; If we want to make more people <unk> , &quot; &quot; If we make more people goedkoper , you know ? &quot;
And it was the answer . It was that it was <unk> . It was the <unk> of American landbouw .
We were going to call them , in fact , in <unk> , in <unk> , a <unk> , the <unk> , which are incredibly <unk> <unk> ,
It &apos;s not a solar system , and it is not landbouw .
Our goal is to be bedreigd now , not to be bedreigd , not to be obese , but by reducing resources .
It &apos;s not through those <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , but through land , not through the pompen , but through verse water , not by <unk> , it is through border , not by <unk> , and water , not via water .
They &apos;re going to feed the world ?
Well , let &apos;s start with the question , how were we going to feed ?
Of course , how can we make sense , how can we be able to put together a range of food ,
You know , I don &apos;t think of it in front of the future .
It &apos;s really , really , really .
<unk> , chemie , machines , machines , and it &apos;s not something really good for food ,
We &apos;re going to see the <unk> model .
It &apos;s that it is , in fact , two billion jaar <unk> <unk> .
You see Miguel , as Miguel , as Miguel .
Now , these are not the ones who are in front of us , these are things that are broken , in which they were , in fact , <unk> , in terms of pollution , in those places , not only intense , boeren , die not only <unk> , they &apos;re experts ,
They are the experts who are experts .
And when I &apos;m really serious , they &apos;re becoming more like I am .
Well , that &apos;s me right , because when it comes out of the toekomst , the future of food is heerlijk .
Thank you .
I grew up with a <unk> science fiction ,
In my school , I went to school at school , per half of the day , per capita .
And my <unk> , put me in a book , a <unk> , that my thoughts in other werelden in other werelden , and at least my focus on me , <unk> nieuwsgierigheid .
And this nieuwsgierigheid was <unk> , that I didn &apos;t know when I was in the world , through those of these bossen , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and slangen , and slangen , and all of these things were coming out , and all of these things ,
I was absolutely <unk> ,
And it was all over the poging to know the world , and that changes the world of potential .
And my liefde science fiction has been <unk> in my place , want in the late 60s , we were going to <unk> to the maan , and the diepzee ,
Jacques Cousteau in our woonkamer , in our <unk> shows , that our bodies and plaatsen and a world with wonderen that we never had before ,
And it &apos;s got to look at the <unk> <unk> .
And I was kunstenaar .
I could be tekenen .
And not in any game , these <unk> , these <unk> , they had all these <unk> in the medialandschap ,
And it &apos;s all the time . If we wanted to be a book , we were going to read the <unk> of the <unk> , and we put them on the screen in our mind .
And my response to this was tekenen and to see or aliens , aliens , <unk> , etc .
And in the <unk> , I was constantly crying by the teachers , who had been hiding in my secret ,
And that creativiteit had to stop .
And it was interesting , and that &apos;s what me was going to be called Jacques <unk> shows , that &apos;s the concept that we had to be completely unaware of our Earth here .
Well , surely I would definitely be a buitenaardse world in Yellowstone world , and it really seems to be quite onwaarschijnlijk .
But here &apos;s a world that I could live in , here in the world , and it was even fascinerend and exotic as it was that I had to be <unk> , when I had this book .
And I went , when I was 15 ,
That was the one that was in a small dorpje in Canada , one of 100,000 miles away from the United States .
And I didn &apos;t know why I didn &apos;t know .
I <unk> my vader , totdat there was an <unk> in Buffalo , New York , to find the way on the other side of the grens , where we lived .
I went out in a pool of <unk> in the middle of the winter in Buffalo , New York .
The Earth , however , had two years later , I was two years later , when we verhuisden .
Today , in those of us , in 40 years , that &apos;s where <unk> , I &apos;ve spent three and half uren underwater , 500 dollars ,
And I &apos;ve learned that the world of the diepzee , in fact , in the <unk> oceanen , is that , rijk in the world , that we can &apos;t think of it .
And that doesn &apos;t mean the ability of the natuur , in tegenstelling with our own , <unk> menselijke verbeelding .
and at the time , at the time , I was very serious for the last minute ,
My God , it &apos;s a way to put it in the world , and you will .
And as I was , as a volwassene , I was a <unk> ,
It felt that the greatest way , my <unk> drang to my <unk> , to my verlangen to come back ,
As a kind of time , I was always in touch ,
And these films , they were <unk> , and they are together .
And the way that they were , these things , that I <unk> , or <unk> , &quot; The &apos; <unk> , &quot; &quot; Aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And with &quot; <unk> &quot; , I could be my voorliefde voor that <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tie it to you .
And then I set up with both of my <unk> .
And it was interesting to &quot; <unk> &quot; on &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is , in fact , a <unk> problem in this film -- and we &apos;ve got to set up a form of vloeibaar <unk> , where we &apos;re going to be on <unk> <unk> , <unk> ,
And what it &apos;s found out , was that it was <unk> <unk> , you know ,
And the film had no money , but it &apos;s got to turn out his <unk> , but I noticed something fascinerend : that &apos;s the human being over all over the world who had been <unk> through the world ,
Laut Arthur Clarke , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
They were also <unk> .
And it was very exciting .
And I was thinking , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s got a lot in those <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And we went in &apos; The &apos; &apos; Terminator , my next film , a lot ,
And by the way , we build <unk> , we creëerden the vent of nature of sand . And the magnitude of it would be made out of it .
And it werkte . We had something <unk> , and that was one of the things that we had to do with it . And we &apos;ve got a lot more money ,
And by the way of both of those of us , the world was a world , a whole new world of creativiteit for <unk> .
And I was a bedrijf , and I joined with my dear vriend <unk> Winston <unk> , which was at the time of the best <unk> and <unk> .
And the reason of this was this , was this thing , that , in fact , <unk> , <unk> systems , to <unk> <unk> , and to start with digital <unk> .
And this is what we did , as well as a while , we have a <unk> ,
but somewhere in the late &apos; 90s , we noticed that we in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we did was this business plan , too ,
And I had this stukje , &quot; Avatar &quot; , that that <unk> <unk> in things to be known to visuele effecten and <unk> at some point in complete dynamic , with <unk> human , <unk> human , die to be made out of it . And that <unk> would be <unk> . And the world would be <unk> .
And the way that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and those people in my business vertelden me , &quot; Well , I can &apos;t be able to deal with it . &quot;
And I <unk> it , and I did this other film over the long , over the very much ,
And it &apos;s the <unk> , I used to be called Romeo and Juliet on a schip called &quot; Romeo and Juliet . &quot;
but , in fact , , I was , in fact , in the <unk> of the Titanic <unk> .
And that &apos;s what I did .
That &apos;s the truth . And that &apos;s the way that it &apos;s not .
And I was , but I think , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to be <unk> . We &apos;re going to take this completely apart .
We &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
And it &apos;s incredibly important . It &apos;s a lot of <unk> marketing . &quot;
And I <unk> them , a <unk> ,
<unk> , but it &apos;s going to be <unk> , that &apos;s going to be a reality ,
And then , in fact , six maanden later , a reality , in which I was in a plastic <unk> <unk> , four miles away , four miles away ,
It was not a film , not HD , it was real .
It &apos;s got me <unk> .
And that was huge , enormous . We &apos;ve got cameras and white , and all of you have <unk> .
And my way to me , who was very , very much , very much of it , <unk> <unk> .
After yes , they were <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ,
You &apos;re going to get in this capsule , where you look at the donkere , <unk> , <unk> omgeving , where no hope is going to <unk> , als man it &apos;s not going to be .
And I was thinking , &quot; Whoa , that &apos;s net even , as I was in a field ,
It &apos;s really cool . &quot;
I was like this , I was a <unk> ,
Well , of course , the thing , the nieuwsgierigheid and science , it was all the way . It was all the way . It was nieuwsgierigheid , it was nieuwsgierigheid ,
And it was a real time , that Hollywood didn &apos;t exist .
Because , you know , I could see a different kind of <unk> , but I couldn &apos;t think of it , but I couldn &apos;t think of it , I couldn &apos;t see it ,
And at some point , I have seen some of the expeditions in <unk> , and soms things , that I had neither had nor other things that I had before , and that had no other things that had never seen before , and at that point that they didn &apos;t look at it .
And it got me <unk> , and I wanted to be more .
And then I went through this sort of thing ,
Na , &quot; Titanic , &quot; &quot; Titanic &quot; , I said , &quot; Well , I will be my <unk> as a filmmaker in Hollywood in Hollywood , and I &apos;m going to get <unk> . &quot;
And then we began to implement those of them .
We came up with the &quot; <unk> &quot; , and <unk> it with <unk> .
We were <unk> off the way of the Titanic .
We took little robots die we had built , which we had a <unk> <unk> ,
Our bedoeling was , <unk> , and the inner city of <unk> , was never going to be done .
And no one had been into the inner space of the <unk> , and there were no way to it . We &apos;ve got that technology .
And on the way , and on the table of the Titanic , in a <unk> , and I see <unk> , and I see <unk> , that &apos;s one of these <unk> , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to see that &apos;s the band ,
And I &apos;ve been riding with a little <unk> door these <unk> of <unk> .
I mean , I <unk> it , but my imagination is in the <unk> .
And it was , in fact , , to me , fysiek in the <unk> of the Titanic ,
It was that it was <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve seen you , want to see , I want to go through a <unk> , because I knew it in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , when we <unk> the film .
And the set of the set of <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ,
It was a very , very peculiar , very few ,
And you know , that <unk> me <unk> , that je <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the way that your imagination in the voertuig , in fact , can be shy of it .
It was very serious very , very serious .
And it might be a smaller uitzicht , perhaps , in some of us , in some sense , in some of us , in some sense , to be able to be able to be able to be able to learn anything about it , in all sorts of things , in all sorts of things , in all sorts of things , in all sorts of <unk> , that I could be <unk> .
And on this event , we started to know what we saw at the very top , and we actually <unk> , this <unk> , where we saw these incredibly <unk> dieren , and this is alien , but here on Earth .
They &apos;re living with <unk> ,
They &apos;re not going to be in the presence of the zonlicht that we are doing .
And so , as you look at the same , there was a way to make a 500 degrees Celsius .
<unk> . And you can &apos;t imagine that they can &apos;t be able to overleven .
And at the time , I was very , very much , very much about <unk> , that &apos;s been my <unk> ,
And then , in fact , I got to know where the space is geïnteresseerd in the space , and it &apos;s going to work with NASA , and in <unk> , and in <unk> , and in fact , you &apos;re going to open up to Rusland , &quot; <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re going to open up our <unk> ,
It was fascinerend .
And on the end , it was the way that I went out in that diepzee ,
And I went up with them , and I <unk> them up to the world at the top , <unk> , <unk> , people , die were interested in those extreme places . I <unk> them into the bronnen , zodat ze , in fact , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
We &apos;ve been <unk> , but it was , in fact , science , more important , <unk> .
And then , as a result , the cirkel was as a <unk> , as kind of , as a kind of , and the shape of the world .
And in the process , I &apos;ve learned a lot ,
I &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but I &apos;ve learned about <unk> .
Now , you think , if I think , the regisseur must be able to be able to be able to be a <unk> , as a <unk> ,
but I didn &apos;t know much , I didn &apos;t know much , before I had this zone .
Because at a point , I had to say , &quot; Well , what am I doing here ?
Why doe I ? &quot;
These <unk> films don &apos;t make any money .
We &apos;re just going to show you that <unk> , no , no <unk> .
All the way , I think , &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; , and &quot; Avatar &quot; , and I had to put me on the surface of the strand .
I &apos;ve got all these films , these <unk> , for a very small human ,
They &apos;re not roem , no , no , no , no , no .
And you &apos;re going to do this job , and that &apos;s the way that the uitdaging is , and the oceaan is that , you know , that &apos;s where it is , you know , <unk> , and the way it &apos;s <unk> , and the way it is , when a small group of people is a team of a team .
We &apos;ve done it all by 10 , 12 people , who had jarenlang samengewerkt together , and we had two to three maanden on the left ,
And in this world , you know , that was that the most important thing that has been <unk> , that guy has been <unk> , because you &apos;ve got a job , you know , that guy has no way to any other way .
When you go to land and say , &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got to do it , the <unk> , that <unk> , and that &apos;s very <unk> , all of these people , and that &apos;s the problem , the human <unk> , als man on the other hand , and it &apos;s not the way that of the agent of agent , of course , of any of these things , of any time , of any of these things , of what they &apos;ve had , and that they can &apos;t tell anyone that they
That &apos;s a link , a <unk> respect .
And if I had ever been out of my film , &quot; Avatar &quot; , I &apos;ve been able to <unk> my <unk> , and I &apos;ve been able to <unk> his team , want to respect his team .
It was that the dynamiek was really different .
And there was also a little team , on <unk> terrein , and we &apos;ve been called &quot; Avatar &quot; , met a new tech company , which had neither nor before .
<unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s a massive uitdaging .
And we were going to be in a loop or a <unk> ,
And this is a way of making films .
People , who said , &quot; We had these <unk> , yes , we had to be <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And for me , it was more like me , my job , my job , is the actual product , which has been veranderd in the world .
And what can we do ?
What &apos;s what we &apos;ve learned ?
I think , in fact , I think , I think , is nieuwsgierigheid .
That &apos;s the most powerful human condition .
Our verbeelding is a power , which is a way to create a reality .
And the <unk> of your team is more important as all the world .
And to me , jonge filmmaker , who say , &quot; Geef me a advies , who I can do it . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t worry .
And it &apos;s got any other thing to do with you . You don &apos;t have to hold it to yourself . &quot;
And that NASA has a <unk> : &quot; <unk> is no alternatief . &quot;
But in the sense , in the art , and to be <unk> , there must be no alternatief , because there it is .
Not a big deal , that innovatie had failed , you &apos;ve had no problem .
Man moet bereid have over risico \&apos; s .
And that &apos;s the idea , that I have to ask you to be on the way . <unk> is a alternatief , but it &apos;s not . Thanks .
Now , as I &apos;m going to ask you today , that that &apos;s all the data that we &apos;re going to use , which is the whole of the data that we &apos;re going to use , which is the way to the parts of your parts , and in the way to thinking of how we think about informatie , that we think we &apos;re using informatie to be , and we &apos;re trends , and we &apos;re able to recognize trends , and we &apos;re trends , and we &apos;re so trends die that had to
And here we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
And this is a quick experiment , this is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called <unk> , and I can be <unk> by <unk> , and I can be <unk> by some of the words .
And direct , I see a different paradigm ,
And in fact , here &apos;s where people are going to be here at TED , and they &apos;re here at TED .
We &apos;re going to run a way to go through this data , and look at that data and see that <unk> and <unk> <unk> , but not any of it .
Now , when we go to and we &apos;re <unk> up , we &apos;re going to be able to see 40 of us , we &apos;re going to be able to see that crashes at the same time , that the crashes will be <unk> over that people have been <unk> to that .
And so , wie <unk> it , that &apos;s what it is for people to be true .
And you know , that &apos;s the ability to figure out data and data and data , and that &apos;s going to be very , very important to be in some form of zwemmen .
And as we can do this for ruwe data , why not content ?
Now , what we &apos;ve got here is that it &apos;s <unk> every game of course , &quot; The <unk> <unk> &quot; ,
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online .
They &apos;re going to ask my talk in your <unk> in your <unk> .
<unk> can be in a way of all 10 years .
They &apos;re going to be able to be in one of these things .
They &apos;re able to jump on a set of output
Now , when I look at it here , I see these <unk> , which are in this <unk> and comedy .
I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to show you all the <unk> <unk> Armstrong .
Now , when I think about it , I think , &quot; OK , I think , &quot; OK , I think , &quot; OK , what I &apos;m going to do ? &quot;
And I &apos;m going to go through this , I &apos;m going to go back to that .
I see Greg <unk> .
And this is a idee of that , when you look at this , when you look at these kinds of things , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And you power something , it &apos;s a little bit different .
And it is something , and we think , and we think it is the way we can use informatie ,
I &apos;d like to introduce this piece of a little bit , a little bit crazy .
What we &apos;ve done here is , you know , we &apos;re going to take each other <unk> , and at a very small samenvatting .
And that samenvatting is a quick design , and it &apos;s a real design for the problem .
I &apos;m just going to show you the top of the <unk> <unk> .
But in fact , in this sense , we &apos;re going to be able to make a lot of things .
And we &apos;re going to see a lot of it over those of us who are at Wikipedia on Wikipedia ,
Now , I &apos;m going to talk to you . &quot;
Well , when I first , when I look at &quot; I &quot; , I think that those <unk> , I think , &quot; People &apos;s <unk> <unk> , &quot;
And this is really important , because it &apos;s an appreciation that it &apos;s not in one form of <unk> .
It &apos;s just to recognize as a matter of <unk> , as a matter of <unk> .
<unk> on one of those <unk> , I &apos;m going to put in this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and all of it .
Now , as I &apos;m going to see all these <unk> , I think that &apos;s the overgrote meerderheid of it . Some of them are going to be in front of the science . Some of it is my baas , and it &apos;s my baas . And it &apos;s my baas .
And interestingly , Bono has a TED Prize .
And we &apos;re going to jump to the TED Prize , and we can <unk> at all the TED <unk> .
You see , we &apos;re browsing the web of the web , and it &apos;s the same way it is a web , not just to pagina , but it &apos;s much more abstract .
And I &apos;d like to show you a little bit of a small verrassing ,
I &apos;m going to show you just the New York Times .
<unk> , this toepassing -- I &apos;m not going to be a browser , it &apos;s really not a browser , but man can look at websites , and we &apos;re able to look at websites , and we &apos;re putting this online web to each website .
I can go down , and I can jump into some of you <unk> .
And that &apos;s why this is belangrijk , because you know , that &apos;s the creative way of thinking of websites in this way and think that all of you can think of it .
And I can go on at the same time in a very similar stage .
So here &apos;s the point of all the data that I have to put on .
And I am in all the things I had to do today ,
And , als I go through , then , I look at it , I &apos;m going to open up my <unk> , I &apos;m going to set up my <unk> , and I &apos;m going to look at &quot; <unk> , &quot; here , I &apos;m going to look at &quot; <unk> &quot; , here , right here ,
And here &apos;s where I can go on the other day .
Now , it &apos;s a metafoor , which has always been <unk> , and every time you turn it into the wider world ,
Right now , in this world , we think , that &apos;s where data is <unk> .
Well , we &apos;ve got to reason whether it &apos;s <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to reason for the &quot; <unk> in the world . &quot;
What , in fact , the Internet , and the Internet on our mind , the Internet , that we &apos;re going to be in the world in plaats van the other things , is going to start to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go to things , die different hidden hidden ?
Now , as we can do this , this <unk> , this is what it is , maybe a bunch of different things of things ,
And , in fact , , in order to be able to move into informatie , we &apos;re able to get to know about it .
And when we look at that , then we can look at it , maybe we &apos;re going to look at it .
Thank you , dankjewel .
Everyone &apos;s talk today ,
I have some of the people who have this idea of <unk> , who have been put together in the &quot; Happiness &quot; in the &quot; <unk> &quot; , and they were going to put half on the left , and they were <unk> .
And it &apos;s a huge golf of interest in a different way of all the time .
It &apos;s very much <unk> .
Everyone would love to be happy .
And yet , ondanks all of this golf , have it some <unk> <unk> , that it &apos;s a bit of a <unk> , <unk> ,
And my talk today is , is that most of the cognitieve <unk> is acting .
And it &apos;s the reason for <unk> , which , to think , to think about a lot , and it &apos;s the scientist , who think about geluk , want to think about it , is that we &apos;re consistent with all of us .
That &apos;s the first of all the <unk> , one <unk> , complexiteit .
And it &apos;s because of course , that &apos;s not a silly woord , because we &apos;re going to want to be in many different things , because we &apos;re going to be on it .
I think , in fact , there is a bit of important respect that we might be <unk> , but it &apos;s something that we have to have , and we &apos;re able to think that we have to be <unk> , and we &apos;re going to think that is welbevinden .
And this is the tweede thing , is a long-term view of human culture and <unk> , and in fact , what &apos;s out of gelukkig in his life and gelukkig , over his life , and gelukkig , over his life .
And this is two very different ideas , and they are both <unk> in the sense of happiness .
And that &apos;s the final thing that <unk> , and it &apos;s the very common thing that we can &apos;t think about a way to think about the fact that we don &apos;t think about a way to make sense , which is to make sense ,
I mean , that &apos;s a genuine <unk> ,
It &apos;s not a way of doing it .
Well , I &apos;d like to introduce you with somebody , who had a <unk> , who had an expert on one of my colleges , the <unk> , &#91; Out of <unk> &#93; , and there was a <unk> , and it was completely insane , and it was completely out of the shot of the shot of the shot ,
And then there is , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , all the kind of stuff that &apos;s going through .
But it didn &apos;t .
Now , what had it is , that &apos;s what had had to do with those of us .
There had this ervaring .
There was 20 Minutes on Twitter .
They didn &apos;t make sense , because there was a way to <unk> , and that was , you know , <unk> , and that was , you know , everything , everything , everything , everything , everything , everything ,
Now , what we really think is , is that we think about and other people think in the ability to think about two types of compassion .
And it &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s in the world in the future , and that &apos;s what it is , in fact , that &apos;s the future , in fact , that &apos;s the future , but in fact , that &apos;s the point .
And it is the <unk> of the arts , the arts -- you know , when the arts says , &quot; Oh , when I <unk> here ? &quot;
And then , in fact , it is a <unk> , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called the <unk> of the <unk> , and that &apos;s the history of our life , and this is where the arts &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s the way that the arts <unk> , &quot; Who have been the first time ? &quot;
&quot; Who was your <unk> <unk> ? &quot; , of course .
And this is two very different types of other places , the <unk> , and the <unk> , and both of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of happiness .
Now , the <unk> is a verhalenverteller .
And it starts with a very common reactie in our imagination , which is immediately .
We don &apos;t say to other people , as we &apos;re going to do , the other way .
And our reason has to give us the way to tell us that , what we want to say is , is a story , you know , is a story .
And let &apos;s start with a clip of it .
He &apos;s a old studie .
These are real of real work , which is a very difficult procedure .
I &apos;m not going to go in detail . It &apos;s not much fun , but she was pijnlijk , when this research came out in &apos; 90s .
They were bitten , all the 60 seconden to talk over their people .
And here it is two of them . They &apos;re their records .
And they were asked , &quot; Well , wie or two ? &quot;
And it &apos;s a very simple question .
<unk> B has a lot to do , and it &apos;s a lot of time , the <unk> , and every minuut of the pijn , the patiënt A had to have <unk> B , and more .
But it &apos;s a different question , &quot; Well , who have been thinking of those of us who were <unk> ? &quot;
Here &apos;s a verrassing :
And that verrassing , as a patient , A , A , A , <unk> <unk> had to <unk> as a patiënt B.
Those are the other people who were different , and it &apos;s a very important piece of the geschiedenis , who is out of the geschiedenis .
and not all of this -- not very <unk> , but one of them is very , very much , very much , but one is very much better , but one is very much better .
And that , which , which , was , is that , very , very , very , very , very , very serious about it . It &apos;s a very powerful story .
What do we know ?
And because we &apos;ve been asking them to ask people , &quot; Well , how many of you know , &quot; who was very much better , &quot; Who &apos;s been in all right ? &quot;
And it was much better for A to be like B in the <unk> .
Well , this is a literal way of what is a literal way to and the <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> of the <unk> , B was a bit ,
Now , here you might be a <unk> A , and we &apos;ve worked in clinical trials , and it &apos;s done , and it is , you know , this is , you know , <unk> A <unk> , A <unk> can be a <unk> by the way to the tube ,
And it &apos;s going to cause that the patient lijdt , but it &apos;s only a bit more and more and much less .
And you know , as a matter of fact , a lot of a lot , you &apos;ve got to have a <unk> , A <unk> A , A <unk> A , and you &apos;ve got to have a <unk> A , A <unk> A , A <unk> A , A <unk> A , a <unk> A , a <unk> A ,
Which is what makes you a picture ?
And it &apos;s the reason for those of us who have the geheugen and it &apos;s the way that we &apos;re going to take care of it .
The idea is , you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> , very important , and in this case , <unk> it .
Now , the long-term self is in the world .
It &apos;s the second thing of the <unk> , one of it .
And you wonder : &quot; Well , what happens ?
And the answer is really simpel . They &apos;ve lost forever .
And that , the most of the time of our life , and I &apos;ve got this -- you know , that &apos;s the time , that &apos;s the psychological way of all of the time for three seconden . What &apos;s , you know , that it &apos;s going to be 600 million of us . &quot;
Those are the most or they were completely genegeerd or <unk> .
And yet , you know , you have to make sure that they have to say , &quot; Well , this is what &apos;s going on in the <unk> of the <unk> of the time .
It is that this is a limited resource , which we &apos;re using in this world .
And who we make it , seems to be important , but it &apos;s not that the geschiedenis , that &apos;s the <unk> for us .
And we have the <unk> of the self and the <unk> , and they &apos;re really different .
It is the biggest difference between them .
If you look at the <unk> of the <unk> , as you &apos;ve got one vakantie and the same week , the same thing that &apos;s been out , the <unk> on the table , it &apos;s the <unk> on the table .
And that &apos;s the way that you can &apos;t do it for the <unk> .
For the <unk> , for a while , we &apos;re not much better at the <unk> vakantie at the time , because he &apos;s not going to use any new imagination .
They didn &apos;t change that .
And on this way , at this point , the critical variabele , which is a <unk> self , which is a <unk> self , and has a very , very tiny , very common sense of that .
Now , the <unk> , the more , is to say , &quot; Give and <unk> . &quot;
And it &apos;s actually that , in fact , is that , by the way , that &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to do with a patiënt , which , in fact , , the same thing , two <unk> of two different chirurgen in two different groups , and beslissen , &quot; Well , the thing that &apos;s going on , you know , the thing that &apos;s going on , you know , that &apos;s the thing that you have to be , that &apos;s the thing that &apos;s that , that &apos;s the thing , that
That &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
We don &apos;t choose between any of us . We &apos;re going to hear from the herinneringen of <unk> .
Now , when we think about the toekomst , we think we think about our toekomst as a <unk> .
We think about our toekomst as a future ,
And in fact , you know , you know , if you think about the creation of the future , and , you know , the <unk> of the future , and you can think of it as a matter of fact , the <unk> of what &apos;s called the <unk> of the future , which is that it doesn &apos;t have to take any of you .
Now , I have this idea that when we &apos;re going to be on vakantie , that &apos;s what it is , we &apos;re going to be on vakantie at the public school ,
And it &apos;s a bit of hard work , I think ,
I mean , who are very nervous ?
And it &apos;s one of the verklaringen that &apos;s going on for the <unk> of the <unk> .
And as I think , I think , I think , on a couple of years , I think we &apos;ve done a couple of years ago in Antarctica , which I had to do with you , and I think it was very , very much , very much in relation to me , and I think I think it is in the form of other people ,
And I probably have to think of my <unk> in this <unk> trip , I would say , I would say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to show you for four years ,
Now , when I open up you the <unk> , I had a <unk> of 600 and a half of my time .
It &apos;s got three weken , and it &apos;s so much more and more .
That &apos;s what it looks like for <unk> .
Well , I think I &apos;m going to be a little bit more , you know , that , in fact , , I think , &quot; I have to be <unk> , &quot; but I think , as you know more , it &apos;s a real question . &quot; So , what do we do , a real question . &quot; So , why do we make any sense to make any of you in the <unk> of the human being , what we &apos;re going to do ?
And I want you to think about a <unk> .
<unk> your next vakantie , you know , you know , you know , you know , in all of your <unk> , all your <unk> , and you have a <unk> geneesmiddel , you know , no , no , no ,
You &apos;ve got to hold on dezelfde vakantie ? And als je on one another vakantie <unk> , it &apos;s a conflict between both of you , and you &apos;ve got to think about it , and it &apos;s definitely not obvious , want to think about the time , when you think about the time , you &apos;re going to be a antwoord . And when you think of , you might see a different answer .
And why we <unk> that <unk> , which we &apos;re going to select is a problem , and it is a very different way of the self .
And the both other of the people who are both <unk> , is two <unk> .
There are actually two theories of course , which we can be able to use , a <unk> of the self .
And you can ask : &quot; Who &apos;s been happy ? &quot;
And then you would ask , &quot; Who , who have been happy in the &apos; 70s ?
And all of us , all the time , have a very complicated proces ,
What are these kinds of emoties that might be gemeten ?
And on the way , we &apos;re in a very good way of thinking of geluk in the future of the future .
If you think about the <unk> of the <unk> , it &apos;s a different thing .
And it doesn &apos;t look like any of a different person .
That &apos;s the way of all of the sweet people , and it &apos;s the way that person is , as you know it , to think of it .
It &apos;s very different .
Every one of us , the reason it &apos;s not will be in the way that it &apos;s going to be , the more or less , and I &apos;m going to be a long time , some of us , all over the place , that the way that of all of us have to know about geluk , that it &apos;s the way that of all of the people have been <unk> on the way that we have to know all the time .
That onderscheid between the geluk of the <unk> of the self , and the happiness of the <unk> is in the world , and you know , and now , you know , these <unk> are <unk> .
And that Gallup <unk> is a global poll , in the same time , as a half as a million people have been asking questions , over how they think about their life , and over their <unk> . And he <unk> other things .
And in the voorbije jaren , we start to learn about the future of the <unk> .
And that &apos;s the final thing that we have , I think , is that they have to be really different .
And you know , you know , you know , who gets somebody with it , and it &apos;s not a lot of it , and it &apos;s not a lot of it , who &apos;s going to live out of his life , and vice versa .
Just to tell you how to relate to correlatie , which is a correlatie with it .
Now , what &apos;s it , als je somebody and you would say , &quot; Oh , you know , oh , oh , you know , oh , his vader is a <unk> , who would be a <unk> ,
Well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , there are a lot of options , but he &apos;s <unk> .
They have a <unk> .
And when I say to you , if you look at his life as a way of thinking of a <unk> , what you &apos;ve got is , you know , a lot of onzekerheid , you know , that &apos;s a lot of onzekerheid over the outside of it .
And that correlatie is very much .
We know what the happiness level of <unk> is .
We know that money is very , very important , very important .
We know that , that &apos;s all the way that geluk is , you know , we &apos;re happy to be happy with people , that we may be happy with people who we love .
<unk> , but it &apos;s dominant .
Now , as you know , the reason of both of the <unk> of the same as well , will be very different things .
And the final note , which I said here , is that we really don &apos;t think that we really have to be <unk> as a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a completely different term .
Now , at the same time , a different issue , whether we can &apos;t think about geluk , is that we &apos;re not going to focus on those of us as we think about the world , and when we really think about it .
Now , if you ask the simple question , &quot; Well , that &apos;s why people who are alive in California are not the correct answer .
If you think about the question , &quot; Well , you know , think that people in California have to be gelukkiger when you go in Ohio .
And what happens is , when you think about the life in California , think about the difference between California and other places , and this is what makes us , in the world , is in the world .
Well , it turns out , &quot; Well , that klimaat is not very important for that global self , and it &apos;s not a very important thing to do with the <unk> of people . &quot;
Well , because of course , what &apos;s called <unk> , you can see , you know , some people could be done on the end of California .
And it &apos;s been an interesting thing to know , what happens to people , who have been to California , who have to live in prison ,
Now , their <unk> is not gelukkiger .
We know it .
But one of the things that &apos;s got to do , they think they &apos;re gelukkiger , want als they think about , they were thinking , &quot; Well , they were doing this wonderful thing in Ohio . &quot; And they got to feel that they were the real deal in Ohio .
It &apos;s very , very much , very much to thinking about comfort , and I &apos;m going to ask you , I have a problem of it .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thanks . I have a question .
Thank you very much .
Well , if we had a couple of weeks ago , I &apos;ve had to tell you me to me , it was a pretty interesting product , that &apos;s where this <unk> poll was ,
Is it what you can do with any of us , want you &apos;ve got a couple of minutes left ?
Daniel <unk> : I guess .
I think , the interessantste thing that we have is in the <unk> , is a getal , that we really didn &apos;t think of it .
We found it in terms of the <unk> of the <unk> .
And as we watch , the way to observe , which is to be different .
And it is , in a way , 60,000 dollar per year , for Amerikanen , , , and it &apos;s a very big sample of R , and it &apos;s a very , very thousand , but it &apos;s a big representatieve sample , in a $ 600,000 sample ,
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars per people are ongelukkig , and they become more vulnerable , and they were armer .
We get a perfectly flat position .
I have , I know , I &apos;ve had zelden <unk> lijnen .
Now , what happens is , is that , for a while , is that money , no <unk> of money , but gebrek to lack of <unk> , and we can do that very much , very much , very much , very much .
In the sense of the other self , the <unk> , you have a different verhaal .
You make more money , more money ,
They don &apos;t care about emoties .
CA : Well , Danny , in all of his American <unk> , is over to leven , vrijheid , to geluk .
If people have been serious , I think , this is all the way to make it all the sense of mind , everything we think , in terms of the problem , everything we think , in terms of <unk> , etc .
Is it possible to imagine that the country is in fact a <unk> who would be considered to be serious and based on politiek ?
DK : Well , I think , I think , is that he &apos;s erkenning that he &apos;s <unk> in the public sector .
And that &apos;s going to be very , very , very much in the United States , not a question , but in the U.K . , and in the U.K . , they &apos;re doing right now .
Those people are <unk> , to think that they think , when they think about politiek ,
And it &apos;s going to take a while , and those people have been <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> , of course , they &apos;re going to be able to be <unk> , we &apos;re going to have this debat that we &apos;re going to do with this debat .
You know , that might be a lot of different way to raise it , which is afhankelijk of how to think , and to think of it , and to think of the <unk> of the self , and you think of the <unk> .
This is politiek , I think , in the komende jaren .
And in the United States , <unk> je , the <unk> of the bevolking meet <unk> .
I think , in the next two , I think , in the next two of the people &apos;s minds ,
CA : Well , it seems to me this topic , this topic , of course , that &apos;s the subject of the most exciting public debat in the next few years .
Thank you very much for that uitvinding of gedragseconomie .
Thank you , Danny <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk to you over energy and klimaat .
And it &apos;s probably going to wonder , because my <unk> is , in fact , that my <unk> and zaad is over to use those things , which we &apos;re going to uitvinden and we have to deal with the armste two miljard people ,
However , energy and klimaat is incredibly important for those people , and it &apos;s actually important for all of us on the planet .
<unk> means that , in fact , that , in fact , that they &apos;re not going to grow up , and we &apos;re too much of it , too much , too much of it . And that &apos;s the things that we can &apos;t be able to do with it , who can &apos;t be able to withstand it , who can &apos;t be able to withstand it .
It leidt to <unk> . It leidt to be <unk> .
And , in fact , klimaatverandering becomes more terrible for them .
And it &apos;s been very important for them to be very important .
In fact , when you think about one of those of us , the price of the price of energy , the most powerful thing is to be <unk> .
Now , the <unk> is , you know , <unk> ,
It is in fact that it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> .
And that <unk> had the Industriële Revolutie , which was a industriële revolutie , and in fact , in the 20th eeuw , we had a <unk> case in <unk> , and we have <unk> , we can be able to create modern materialen ,
We &apos;re in a wonderful situation in the world in the rich world .
But , als we the prijs verlagen , we &apos;re going to cost half of it -- we &apos;re going to get into a new barrière , and that barrière is going to be with carbon dioxide .
CO2 warms up the planets , and that <unk> is quite clear .
They <unk> the CO2 emissions , which have been called <unk> , and this <unk> has some very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very nervous systems that can &apos;t be able to be able to vary and systemen .
Well , the exact link between one <unk> , and the way that <unk> <unk> , and where their different apes lie , there is some <unk> , but not very much .
And it &apos;s obvious that this is going to be very serious about the effect , but they &apos;re incredibly hot .
I &apos;ve been going to ask those <unk> , &quot; Well , are we going to have to look at it at the same time ?
Does it cost half or a half ? &quot;
That &apos;s the answer , at the same time , we &apos;re going to get to zero .
That &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s different as if you look at it , we have a tall truck , and it &apos;s a high school truck , die it has to do with three feet . It &apos;s the guy where he &apos;s broken .
It has to be done at zero .
Well , we <unk> a <unk> <unk> , over 26 miljard ton .
Every half , 20 ton . People in poor countries , not like one .
It &apos;s gemiddeld 5 ton of it for every on the planet .
And in fact , we have to be able to do that at zero .
It &apos;s gone down .
There are other economic organisms that are actually affecting us , and we have to run out of <unk> verminderen , and we have to deal with zero .
And this vergelijking has four of these things . Some of you have this stuff on the left -- CO2 -- that &apos;s CO2 -- that &apos;s the way of the human being , and it &apos;s going to be afhankelijk of the human being , whether it is any human being associated with the average of every single family , the <unk> of the <unk> , and the carbon dioxide that &apos;s going on .
We &apos;re going to look at each other <unk> , and we think we &apos;re going to make it on zero .
They probably have to be very close to zero .
Now , it &apos;s <unk> algebra , but we &apos;re going to do it .
We had this population .
<unk> miljard people ,
and it moves to 9 miljard in 9 miljard in 9 miljard .
As we &apos;ve done very , very , very , very much with it , the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , we might be 10 percent , but we &apos;re going to be able to deal with a helling 100 percent ,
The tweede factor is that we &apos;re using services ,
It is all the things that we eat , which we eat , kleren , food ,
It &apos;s very , very , very good things , and that &apos;s all those of us who are able to open up all of us on the planet .
It &apos;s cool that this number is going down .
In the world at the bottom , at the bottom , we might be <unk> <unk> , and we can &apos;t use it , but this is going to grow this increase in each other , and in fact , this increase in every single sector , which has been increasing , and it is that every single majority of people who are involved in each other &apos;s services .
Now , here we have a very highly shared partnership , and it &apos;s got to be able to be able to read that machine ?
And those kids don &apos;t have , they &apos;re going to be able to read and they read their <unk> .
Well , at least , at the effectiviteit , the E , which is , at least , has been <unk> .
We &apos;ve got something , it &apos;s not going to work .
They want to be in <unk> , in other parts of it , through other parts of it in efficiency , in fact , there are many of you , many of them , where they can be massively verlagen and dramatically <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Some of them are <unk> to 90 percent .
In other parts of it , who &apos;s <unk> , who is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , of course , <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of course , is that , very much smaller .
And at all , when we &apos;re optimistic , we might be able to save a <unk> , maybe a factor of 10 ,
But at the same time , at the same rate , we &apos;re going to go from 26 miljard in half 13 miljard dollars ,
We look at the vierde factor , and this is a <unk> , and that &apos;s the volume of carbon dioxide , which is a lot of carbon dioxide ,
It &apos;s the question , &quot; Well , that &apos;s the zero . &quot;
If you verbranden kolen , no .
If you verbranden aardgas , no .
Almost every single carbon station , carbon dioxide , CO2 emissions , just like those hernieuwbare energy and <unk> .
Now , we &apos;ve got to set up a global level in a global economy .
We have <unk> .
As I say , &quot; wonder &quot; I &apos;m not the onmogelijke .
The <unk> is one wonder . The PC is a wonder .
The Internet and its services is a wonder .
Those people here have been here in this world of hope .
It doesn &apos;t make any sense that you have any wonder to have any of it .
They &apos;re <unk> and other things , and sommigen are not .
Well , in this case , we have <unk> , and we have a wonder in very early times .
Well , I &apos;m going to ask you , how can I really care ?
Is it a natural framework , a demo , that this is what makes people here ?
And I herinnerde me , vorig jaar , in the world , and I was like the people .
That &apos;s a way of making it happen for them in real time , you know , that people have to live with the mug .
For me , I got this one here .
And I &apos;ve been , that &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> my <unk> here .
And here is some very clear vuurvliegjes .
Man verzekerde me to prevent me , that they don &apos;t happen . They didn &apos;t even want the glas .
Well , there is all kinds of <unk> who this , but they don &apos;t make it much .
We &apos;ve got to use oplossingen , of course , one of the other things that we have to do and have a lot of different things , and there are a lot of different directions , in which people look at it , I &apos;m really going to look at it , I think , five , these big eisen that can be high .
I have <unk> , <unk> , fusie and <unk> .
They might be a <unk> product , and as much as they do faster when I verwacht , it &apos;s cool , but my <unk> here is that we have to be <unk> for all five years , and we can &apos;t be able to fix them , want we &apos;re <unk> , want all of us have <unk> , want all of you have <unk> .
If we look at the verbranden of oil fossiele brandstoffen , verbranden or kolen .
Now , what you &apos;ve got to do , it &apos;s the way , but it &apos;s not the way , but it &apos;s not the carbon dioxide , it &apos;s going to extract the carbon from the outside of the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and hope , and hope , and hope it &apos;s daar .
There are some <unk> , that at 60 percent , 80 percent of it , 80 percent of it , but it &apos;s 100 percent of it . And it &apos;s very , very expensive for that carbon dioxide of carbon dioxide , this is a big challenge . So het is a big probleem here .
How can it make it ?
How can any of you garanderen , that could be , letterlijk , to make a lot of <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and other things ?
It &apos;s a lot volume .
It &apos;s a hard drive .
Next , <unk> .
It has three major problems . And that cost , for all of us , is in <unk> countries . And that &apos;s the question , &quot; Well , no , no , no , no , no , no <unk> , no <unk> of human samenwerking , that the brandstof of the gas is not used for wapens .
And then , power <unk> ?
because there isn &apos;t very much significant , there is a lot of <unk> .
Those people have to feel good . <unk> <unk> : 10 : 20,000 , <unk> <unk> : 10 , three , 3 , <unk> <unk> .
And there are three very different problems , which might be <unk> , and how to work .
That &apos;s the burden on the top three .
They &apos;re <unk> energy , which they call it .
And that &apos;s the thing that &apos;s cool , as well as it &apos;s not brandstof -- they have some of it .
One is <unk> , which these technologies genereren , which is dramatically smaller when they use it .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , 1,000 times as a regular chip .
And on the way , these <unk> have been limited .
That means that the Sun doesn &apos;t come to the day , it doesn &apos;t look at the everyday thing , and that &apos;s not the wind of the wind .
And you know , as you &apos;re afhankelijk is , when you &apos;re afhankelijk , that &apos;s a way , that &apos;s the way that you can &apos;t deal with it .
So , here &apos;s big <unk> . We &apos;re <unk> on the way to the human being . If we say , &quot; Well , that &apos;s the public property outside of the land , you don &apos;t want to use that technology , you &apos;ve got to think of it , that &apos;s the way that it &apos;s been created .
And it &apos;s <unk> .
And on that dimension , I &apos;ve got all the parts of the body , which were being made , &quot; Well , it &apos;s going to be , that for cars , computer , computer , computer commercials , all the way . And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing with this <unk> , which I think all of the batterijen , the computer , that we &apos;re going to use , not the volume that we were able to use , which we &apos;re going to be , not 10 minuten of the <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve got a big difference here , something that &apos;s going to be 100 percent , as much as conditions at the time .
It &apos;s not possible , but it &apos;s not the way .
And it is , as you know , this is what we &apos;ve been trying to do with 20 percent , 20 percent , 30 percent of the <unk> .
If you think about 100 percent of it , what &apos;s going on , you &apos;ve got a tremendous amount of electricity .
Well , what &apos;s going on ? Well , what &apos;s wrong ?
A &quot; Manhattan Project &quot; ? Who are <unk> ?
We &apos;ve got lots and lots and lots and more .
In every single one of us , we have 100 people ,
You know , you know , you know it &apos;s crazy ! It &apos;s good .
I think , here in the TED crowd , there is a lot of that .
Bill <unk> has a bunch of other groups , in other parts of the world who had great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> investeert in tientallen miljoenen bedrijven who have great things and interesting things , and I &apos;m going to raise it .
Nathan <unk> , and I &apos;m going to work on a bedrijf , that , perhaps , <unk> , the nuclear function .
There are some innovaties in <unk> ; <unk> , vloeibaar .
And that &apos;s in this industry , at some point , it &apos;s not a big verrassing , it &apos;s not a big verrassing , that there &apos;s some good ideas .
That &apos;s the <unk> , that in the middle of the <unk> , the one percent , the one percent , the <unk> , we &apos;re going to stop the 99 percent ,
It &apos;s a crazy concept .
But in fact , you &apos;ve got to look up very much lately , but you had no sense of it , as it might be , but it is modern , but it &apos;s the modern supercomputer , you can see it , you know , that &apos;s the way that it &apos;s been <unk> , that it &apos;s <unk> .
And omdat je 99 percent verbrandt , is that <unk> much beter .
In fact , you &apos;re going to eat the waste , and you can actually use it to use today of these today .
And in the way to turn out to get rid of it , it &apos;s a cool thing .
This is uranium dioxide , it &apos;s a bit of a white one .
And you see , it &apos;s a bit of a <unk> , as &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; .
It lost its <unk> .
Here is a picture of one in Kentucky in Kentucky .
It &apos;s the waste , which is 99 percent . You &apos;ve got this stuff , which is <unk> uranium .
That &apos;s what &apos;s going on for 100 years .
And als <unk> goedkoop , and <unk> , you have enough gas , you have enough gas for the rest of the planet .
And , you know , there &apos;s a lot of uitdagingen , but it &apos;s a very important tool , that we have to deal with , we have to deal with it .
We think we &apos;re going to think we &apos;re going to win .
Who would make us look at it ?
Well , we &apos;re going to start the way we have to deal with it , and then we &apos;ve got to talk about the problem .
A lot of it is , a lot of it , 80 percent by 2050 .
It &apos;s really important , that we &apos;re going to get .
Those top 20 percent have been in arms world countries , and it &apos;s going to be something , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> , <unk> and cement .
And , in fact , 80 percent of them have to be in those world countries , including countries who have China , their <unk> ,
That other noot says , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to use this <unk> technologie , &quot; and we &apos;re in all developing countries , and we &apos;re on the way to the rest of it .
It &apos;s great .
It &apos;s got a solar product of that growth .
When we go back to it , what would we do ?
And it &apos;s going to be on those two things .
We &apos;ve got to use those <unk> , using computing , and we &apos;re not going to <unk> , the way it &apos;s <unk> , which is <unk> , and that &apos;s the temperature .
But that &apos;s the reason for those things that we are doing , which we &apos;re going to do , which is not very much to the big <unk> , of it , of course , and even slightly more important who have the expansion of the innovatie for those doorbraken .
These doorbraken , we have to be able to control systems , and we &apos;re able to meet meten in <unk> , in <unk> ,
You know , there &apos;s a lot of great boeken .
The Al Gore book , &quot; We have this keuze &quot; and David <unk> &quot; Sustainable Energy Energy &quot; .
They &apos;re going to be very , very , very , very much of where it &apos;s going to be able to be <unk> , want we &apos;re going to pay for all of the sites , want we &apos;re going to charge of all of the sites .
There are some things that are <unk> .
It &apos;s a wens .
A very important question is that we &apos;re going to be this technology .
As a matter of fact , a wens for that next 50 years , I would love to pick the president , a vaccin , and I would love this , of course , and I would love this wens , which is , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot;
This is what got impact on it .
If we don &apos;t have this wens , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> people are <unk> , between the United States and China , between the poor and China , between the poor and <unk> , and all of the world of two miljard of those two miljard people ,
&quot; Well , what are we doing ? &quot;
What are you doing ?
We have to use <unk> to use .
As landen in the world who are <unk> , they don &apos;t want to talk about CO2 .
And you &apos;ve got to put this <unk> out of the <unk> , and they would be embraced by the <unk> <unk> , which have been besteed by these innovatieve challenges .
We &apos;ve got <unk> , CO2 , gas , <unk> of Trade goods ,
We have to put that message .
We &apos;ve got to combine <unk> , <unk> , and we &apos;ve done things that are done by the way ,
And it &apos;s important , but I think we can put it together .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you very much . Just to know about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , can you think of a lot of the size of that investering ?
Bill Gates : Well , by the way , we have to deal with that simulatie on a supercomputer , all the big men , what we &apos;ve done , is just 10 million . And if we &apos;ve set up our materials in a radio reactor , we &apos;re going to have to be able to use it in a radio reactor , and we &apos;re just going to put it into the <unk> miljoen .
The very exciting thing is to begin to bouwen our <unk> , the other way to think about it , is the way that it is the biggest of it .
Once the first thing is , when there is this , as well as it is , it &apos;s all the way , as you know it , it &apos;s obvious , because it &apos;s <unk> , which is so different , as we know it .
CA : Well , by far , that &apos;s the way that it &apos;s built in the world at the same time , as a verticale as , <unk> <unk> , die <unk> <unk> , and then the proces starts to move on top of it .
BG : Right . Now , you &apos;ve got to <unk> the reactor on the top , and it &apos;s a lot of people , and lots and lots of control , that &apos;s the way that guy can go back . And that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to open up , and it &apos;s not good .
If you have a very , very goedkope brandstof , you can see it for 60 years , you think , you know , a <unk> , you know , without all the rest of it .
And it &apos;s got a place where there &apos;s been 60 years , and it &apos;s done .
CA : <unk> , the problem is , the problem is , a lot of things .
BG : Well , you know , well , you know , it &apos;s got to put it up with the junk , and it &apos;s a lot of a lot of energy , and then put it in the next reactor , and stop it in the next reactor , and stop it .
And we start , by the way , we &apos;re going to put together , which is , in fact , in this bubble of it , and it &apos;s our <unk> , and it &apos;s our <unk> .
And it is , in fact , this problem was , this is a very , very powerful thing , and it is dramatically expanding dramatically in this process .
CA : But in fact , what you &apos;ve had gesproken met people over the world ,
That &apos;s what &apos;s really interesting , this is really true ?
BG : Well , we &apos;re not going to set up in a field , and we have a lot more interesting to everything that &apos;s called &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , and it &apos;s really interesting , and that people in all of his paper were in Rusland in Rusland , India , China , and China , I &apos;ve been here , and I &apos;ve got to talk about it , you know , the <unk> of it .
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the British and Japanners have something in that direction .
This is a different thing of what it is .
This is a very important stap vooruit , but it is , it is , in fact , some of which have been built , and some of it is , that &apos;s a rapid reactor for our first .
CA : And in your mind , in your mind , the same thing , you know , the thing that &apos;s really true in real life ?
BG : We &apos;ve got one of those <unk> , <unk> things , which are very goedkoop , we &apos;ve got 20 years of business , and 20 years on it .
It &apos;s the same thing that we have to do that our <unk> has to be able to see that we have <unk> .
And , you know , <unk> , when everything is fine , and it &apos;s a big wens , it &apos;s a lot of it .
And then , in fact , there are tientallen or bedrijven , and we &apos;ve <unk> , and we &apos;ve got a lot to do with it , which is working on the way to work , that &apos;s going to work on their operation for its day .
And it would be the best , as a matter of fact , it might be a mixture of it .
Well , at least we have a solution .
CA : <unk> the <unk> of the big centuries , is that ?
BG : You know , a solar system is <unk> .
It &apos;s not that it &apos;s <unk> , but it &apos;s very much more important .
And in the nuclear industry , it &apos;s other innovatieve bedrijven .
You know , we don &apos;t know how to do this , but it &apos;s the <unk> , but it &apos;s a different problem .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which may be something very hard , but maybe it &apos;s going to say that over us .
And this is a different , but the nice thing is that a <unk> , one of which is a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and if you look at it , the problem is , and that &apos;s where the straling , the voetafdruk , the voetafdruk and that cost , it &apos;s the impact , the voetafdruk and that cost , you know , that &apos;s the impact , that the impact and other things that affect the world , and other things , snel in a form of water .
CA : If it doesn &apos;t work , then ?
Do we have <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to maintain that ?
BG : If you come in this situation , it &apos;s a while , as you get to a lot of gas , and a lot of a hartaanval , and you have a lot of power , and you have a <unk> of it .
It &apos;s a solar system called &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is to go to other technieken , that we have to put out the opwarming of the Earth , 20 of 30 jaar we <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s just a <unk> .
Man hoopt , we don &apos;t have it .
Some people say , &quot; Well , no , no , no , no , no , no <unk> power , the way you want to eten , because you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it is slim , as opposed to the problem of this problem , but he &apos;s got a conversatie in <unk> , and he &apos;s got a conversatie in <unk> over , of course , the way that it &apos;s going to be , of course , that it &apos;s going to increase in the world , of course .
CA : <unk> : Do you think of one of those of you , you know ?
BG : Well , let &apos;s get the sceptici who are in very different places .
Well , the scientific argument is very much .
Does it mean that the negatieve impact that you have to do with those clouds have to do things ?
There are very , very few things that might be able to tell you , whether it &apos;s one of them in a million .
This is a bit more like AIDS .
And you power today , and we &apos;re getting very much later .
And this is the idea , now , when we got to all sorts of <unk> , in something , in some ways , whether it &apos;s done later , whether it &apos;s not very clear , that &apos;s the fact that this is not very clear , and that &apos;s the fact that it &apos;s not necessarily the ergste scenario , and he &apos;s in the world that &apos;s going to <unk> , and that &apos;s in the rich world , and that &apos;s in fact .
That is , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to call to <unk> .
However , my droom here is that , when we can be economisch , and then the carbon sink , the other thing that &apos;s going to be , &quot; Well , I &apos;m not sure that it &apos;s not carbon neutral , I didn &apos;t know why it is , but I &apos;m going to <unk> , want het is goedkoper , want het is goedkoper .
CA : And it &apos;s your answer to the <unk> <unk> argument , which , as you know all the time and energy to solve this carbon problem , all these different targets , that <unk> , that &apos;s the way to malaria , and that it &apos;s <unk> to malaria , and that it &apos;s a domme verspilling of resources , to geld , that we can investeren a domme verspilling , which we can do .
BG : Now , the actual current uitgaven for that research , that we think that the United States is 10 miljard dollars per jaar when they do today -- that &apos;s not dramatic .
And it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
You &apos;re going to get to big data , and here &apos;s the fact that there is no other people here , when you have something , that &apos;s not an important thing , and I think , for me , is that the meeste verspilling .
Because , you know , you &apos;ve been very , very recently , a <unk> , and it &apos;s not enough , and I think we &apos;re going to need to be more and more things , I think we &apos;re going to need to be more and goedkoper .
As the hell , the guy , the <unk> , is a very high volume , and it &apos;s just the other <unk> .
I mean , every single one of us here has a lot to value our power to our power without changing your lifestyle .
For those of us , two billion , but this is a ramp ,
And <unk> <unk> think about it .
And it &apos;s going to look like this , &quot; Well , why does it mean that this isn &apos;t the research system ? &quot;
And it &apos;s going to be , in fact , in front of it , in front of it , and it &apos;s got to be <unk> , but there &apos;s a lot of a sudden , that &apos;s a very different group , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s <unk> .
And it &apos;s a <unk> , which I &apos;m running for .
That &apos;s the research , it &apos;s just crazy , which it &apos;s <unk> .
CA : Bill , I think I &apos;m going to talk for all the people here , when I say , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to ask you that your wens is . Thanks very much .
BG : Thanks .
I &apos;d like to tell you about me , some of the maanden geleden , in a magazine , <unk> <unk> ,
I &apos;ve <unk> my <unk> <unk> , but I was in front of the <unk> of the <unk> , and I &apos;ve been thinking , &quot; I &apos;m not in my <unk> <unk> , &quot;
I read the code .
&quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
And I &apos;ve got to send this one vriend luid , and I was going to stop laughing , and I was <unk> , but I was <unk> , and I didn &apos;t go to &quot; <unk> &quot; , and I could stop it , and I would stop it out , and let me go back to it , and I want to take off of it .
And it was a <unk> , old lady , <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;ve been thinking about it that &apos;s pretty much known .
but in fact , it was a piece of output in the early 1980s , when I start to begin to come up with my school , and I began to develop my <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and in other parts of the world , and all of the rest of my world .
And God , thank God , I didn &apos;t use <unk> .
I think I was going to be this wonder , I was born in a world , who would be one of whom I think as a persoon , who would be <unk> , their life , in <unk> sense , but I &apos;m going to focus on it .
And then I asked myself the <unk> of 2009 , in 2009 , and I &apos;m going to think that I think there is a <unk> bijdrage .
Here &apos;s the <unk> versie of the <unk> .
<unk> is not much beter .
And by the way , I <unk> those two words in &quot; Near <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; A , &quot;
But it &apos;s not all the words .
And it &apos;s over , over the people who think we think about the people ,
It &apos;s over those waardes , who are in this medium , and who we set up this waarden ,
Our ability to affect our mind is affecting us and that we see people around us .
Many <unk> samenlevingen , including those Grieken , and the <unk> , they really believed that they had a huge power , because it was a big deal , because it was <unk> , and it can be <unk> .
Now , what are we , in fact , <unk> -- a <unk> people , of people who are of us ,
And all of you have been <unk> to <unk> as a kind of <unk> , this is going to be able to fix , save , and let them be <unk> .
Is it not nice , you open up to open ?
One of the things that &apos;s opened up in front of me , was my <unk> <unk> , <unk> Instituut in <unk> ,
And there &apos;s been Dr . <unk> . A <unk> , which you could think of , who you could think of , that the Amerikanen can &apos;t be correct properly . And there &apos;s always been <unk> .
And Dr . <unk> , <unk> , and was very , very much , very much for it to do with it .
And I was in this hospitaal , which I &apos;ve been in this hospitaal , my <unk> ,
And I have to be very , very quickly , <unk> to these <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in fact , you know , my <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> the tapes . I <unk> them . I &apos;m sorry . I haatte them .
And couples , you know , I used to kind of as a nine-year-old kind of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and this training of training , <unk> ,
Op een dag , <unk> hij me tijdens een <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , en hij zei : &quot; Wow , Aimee , je bent zo sterk , <unk> en jong meisje , <unk> en jong meisje .
And als <unk> , I will give you 100 dollar dollars . &quot;
And it was , natuurlijk , a lot of fun , by the way , <unk> , <unk> , zodat ik these <unk> <unk> , who I didn &apos;t know , the <unk> <unk> meisje in the <unk> of the <unk> , in fact , in my <unk> , in fact , that &apos;s got me in my <unk> <unk> ,
And I &apos;m going to ask myself , who are very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very powerful ,
It &apos;s only one of us , or a lot , who &apos;s in <unk> to <unk> the future of a kind of <unk> .
And if you look at it , that &apos;s what you look like for the <unk> of the <unk> , our ability to imagine our patients , not to imagine what we were all going to do , any human beings , to be <unk> ,
Our taal has been taught to rise to the social progress , which was in very often through a technological movement .
And in fact , in fact , I want to say , &quot; Well , let &apos;s say that my benen , that &apos;s my legs , the <unk> of Titan , and <unk> <unk> for titanium and <unk> for <unk> , and over those of us , and over those of us , the ability to engage with them and over those of us . &quot;
and over the world of <unk> , that they are <unk> .
Now , perhaps this is the technological verandering , you know , you know , that it has always been a different reality , that any of the people who know the maatschappij is something very , very much of the maatschappij , and it can be <unk> , and that &apos;s the human ability to adapt to us .
That human ability to perceive -- that &apos;s a interesting story , want people <unk> me terug , and I &apos;m going to ask them , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; Well , that set me <unk> , and I &apos;m hard to wonder , &quot; Well , I wonder , &quot; I wonder , &quot; Well , I wonder why . &quot;
Now , the sense of all of the way to make sense of it , is to live , in fact , that succes , of course , to be a challenge , to be able to deal with a challenge , without any of the <unk> of my life . If my life is so succesvol , I was going to be able to save the <unk> of a object , of my <unk> , of my own <unk> , of my <unk> .
But that &apos;s the truth that we are changing . And we are very , very powerful , as much as it , emotioneel , and both of us .
And I think it &apos;s good .
<unk> is no obstakel , that we have to <unk> , to make our levens .
<unk> are <unk> .
And I tend to <unk> <unk> as my schaduw .
Soms , realiseer ik me that there is a lot of time , and it &apos;s not a while , but there &apos;s always a lot of time .
And I can &apos;t make that effect of the impact , and the odds of the <unk> of a human being .
And in the world , <unk> and uitdagingen , and that &apos;s just more and more and more and more and more and more and more of it . And that &apos;s not the question , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to be clear , &quot;
We &apos;re not just going to care for people who we love , the people that we love , for <unk> , but we &apos;re going to do it .
We &apos;re not blaming our kind of good kids , as we think we can &apos;t be able to vary .
Je moet twee things <unk> : at the same time , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , and to be geamputeerd , and the other people who are <unk> , and I &apos;m not .
And eerlijk gezegd , that was the real world and permanent handicap , which I had to be <unk> , is that the world will be <unk> , they could be me with the world .
And in our verlangen , those people who are fighting to protect , and they have to be warm , that they have to be very , very hard to ask over their <unk> , of what they &apos;re going to do , that we have to deal with the <unk> of the levenskwaliteit that they want to be .
Now , the concept of <unk> concept , which was only <unk> , and that is in a broken way , and that we can fix it , for any of us , a lot of things like that .
If we don &apos;t treat a way to treat people , and not all the strength of the ability and <unk> and recognize , we can see the solution to the environment , which may be the solution to the environment .
We <unk> a people , die our maatschappij had .
And we have to go beyond those <unk> <unk> , and we have to focus on all of the world of human beings .
<unk> , but it is , between the face of our <unk> , and our great <unk> , a link .
We don &apos;t want to be <unk> <unk> , of course , not <unk> , we <unk> , we don &apos;t want to proberen , ze <unk> te vermijden , maar we gaan het over de rug , maar het gaat erom dat het in <unk> kansen <unk> .
It &apos;s the way that I think to myself , to ask , &quot; Well , we &apos;re <unk> to <unk> , we &apos;re open up , we &apos;re going to open up , they &apos;re going to open up , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> , and maybe even <unk> .
And perhaps we &apos;re going to do it , <unk> as a natural thing , <unk> and <unk> , and we see , and we don &apos;t know how to do it .
And in this year , 200 , Darwin &apos;s <unk> , and 150 jaar geleden , and 150 jaar geleden , has Darwin , Darwin , in my face , in my face , in my face , on something very real in human spirit .
I was going to be <unk> : not the sterkste of the kind of the way , and not the <unk> of the world , but the fact that , in fact , there can be an impact on the other way .
And then of conflict , creativiteit .
We don &apos;t know about Darwin &apos;s werk , we know that the ability of people , overleven and <unk> , of the <unk> of the human mind , is to move through conflict .
And , again , verandering and past the greatest human experience of humans .
And maybe we look at what we were , or what we were <unk> , when we were <unk> .
And the way it is , is that the sense of <unk> , one of the <unk> , is a lot of our own power .
We can be more comfortable .
We can <unk> a new value , which is , very , very important ,
Perhaps we can see <unk> as verandering .
<unk> <unk> , we have to deal with a change ,
I think , the most the greatest schade , die we have <unk> , is to believe that we should be <unk> .
Now , let &apos;s see , wie &apos;s it ?
It is not normal .
And it &apos;s <unk> . That &apos;s <unk> . And it &apos;s not the common way . And if you look at the poor , you know ? You know ?
I think , not .
It &apos;s cool , als we this paradigma of the <unk> of the <unk> of the ability to make it , and it might be a bit gevaarlijker , it can be a bit gevaarlijker , and we &apos;re going to be able to get out of a lot of <unk> , and we &apos;re going to invite them to come up with a lot of good and waardevolle vaardigheden in that maatschappij .
<unk> hebben ontdekt dat we mensen leden van onze maatschappij altijd <unk> hebben : <unk> en bijdragen .
And he has evidence that for 60,000 years ago , oudere people and people have been <unk> , and people who had been treated , and this is what happened , in fact , that <unk> in the <unk> of that maatschappij .
They didn &apos;t see those people , and they were <unk> , and they were considered to be treated and <unk> .
A couple of years ago , I went in the middle , in which I was in a <unk> <unk> in the &quot; Red Zone &quot; , in Pennsylvania , and I &apos;m going to show you a <unk> tomaten .
And it was zomer , and I had <unk> .
And I &apos;m , you know , I think , &quot; Well , when it &apos;s not Aimee <unk> . &quot;
And I <unk> me , and I see these oudere man . I didn &apos;t know wie there is .
And I say &quot; Pardon , Sir , we know us ? I can &apos;t remember . &quot;
And there was , &quot; Well , you know , you may not know me to me .
And if I saw you look at the front of your mother , I came out ,
Oh , that .
And it is , natuurlijk , in fact ,
And it was Dr . <unk> , a man , die I had , in my mother , had been heard of my mother , because I was very , very , very , very late , very late ,
And the dokter for <unk> <unk> of my mother was at home , and my father , the man , the man , the man , the man , the man who had been taught me over the world .
And in fact , I was born without being born , and my <unk> had to look at them , and I was just going to look at some , and I had some tenen on the other voet on the other , the <unk> , the people who had been <unk> ,
And there told me , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve got to ask your ouders , &quot; You know , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no way to me .
And really , really , really , I know that there had been <unk> in my entire jeugd , of course , in the middle of the <unk> , I had to be in the middle of the middle of the <unk> , and I didn &apos;t know what my beurs was , of course , of my <unk> , of my <unk> , and I &apos;ve been using this video of my student , <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s this video , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And there was one of your <unk> , the X , the <unk> of human capital .
And you can &apos;t be able to benadrukken how much of that factor of what &apos;s significant about the world of people &apos;s lives .
And Dr . <unk> zei , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve learned , &quot; I &apos;ve learned , &quot; I &apos;ve learned that kind of , when they didn &apos;t do anything other than anything else , als kind of money , als kind of money , als kind of <unk> , als kind of <unk> , als kind of <unk> . &quot;
You know , Dr . <unk> has changed his mind .
And there was , to know , that those of us have been <unk> , and who have to deal with it , two different things .
And I think , in the world , when they first , when they first , when they had 15 years old , my <unk> had to be my fiber for natural gas , my <unk> had no <unk> .
I was very , very common .
If you ask me today , I &apos;m not sure .
And it has been done , <unk> , I have to do something with my benen , and not <unk> .
And perhaps , by the way , I could see that , in fact , I &apos;ve got to be in front of people , that I have to open up , in the middle of the opening , in people , trying to solve me , people who had me <unk> ,
And you know , it has a lot of people , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
Als je iemands eigen , <unk> of <unk> krachten , is de menselijke geest <unk> -- als je dat doet , en voor iemand op een <unk> open , en voor iemand op een <unk> , dan krijg je een heel goede leraar .
They open them , opening up opening .
And the meaning of the <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
It means something , in a way , that &apos;s in a way , that &apos;s in a way , which has been <unk> .
And it &apos;s the way we want to use data ?
In the &apos; 60s , in England , there was a <unk> , <unk> in <unk> ,
They call it &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the United States called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And those students were <unk> .
And that became a student , <unk> , <unk> , and that betere teachers , etc .
They &apos;ve got to put together in a time of time for a minute , a <unk> , which says &quot; <unk> &quot; , which &quot; Very good , &quot; they said , &quot; Well , they were <unk> , they were <unk> , they were <unk> , they were <unk> . &quot;
And by the way , the hart , the hart , is that vice versa , and it &apos;s only voldoende .
And then it was also na drie maanden .
But the other thing that was , it was , in fact , in that school , not one of the kids , who had those school ,
And it was very , very important in this studie , that it was not <unk> .
Those teachers didn &apos;t know that it was veranderd .
And you know , you know , that &apos;s the <unk> , and that &apos;s where these kids have to be enough , and they &apos;ve got to do it with them , and they &apos;ve got to do it .
And that there is a lot of real life , this is a <unk> geest , which was , was <unk> , has no hope to do it . There isn &apos;t no way to make it , it doesn &apos;t change our nature , our inherent sense of Imagination .
If we do it , the human mind is going to be able to hope , to hope , to hope , and other people to be <unk> , nieuwsgierig and <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be able to turn our GPS <unk> .
If any of us have a sense of all of those qualities , we can create a new way of living ,
I &apos;d like to end up with a gedicht , which has been a <unk> poet named <unk> in the 14e eeuw , and by my way , my vriend , Jacques <unk> , and the <unk> , &quot; The God , that &apos;s just four words . &quot; &quot; God , the only kind of God , not the God of God , not the God of the <unk> , the God , the only thing that &apos;s just four words , not the God of the God , but the God , the only thing that &apos;s
Kom , <unk> with me . Thank you .
