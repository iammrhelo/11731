So at some time , Peter <unk> here , Peter <unk> here at TED .
<unk> .
And the answer is : <unk> four , four and a half of four to a very long time of 20 to 20 miles per week .
You can do it .
All the simple thing , which is just a very simple deal , which is just a good thing to work very quickly .
And that &apos;s what I thought that I was looking at a very interesting answer .
I mean .
In fact , I &apos;ve spent the decision in about 70 to 70 to the whole world of the world , leaders and Architekten and Architekten and Architekten and <unk> .
And that &apos;s why , in fact , thank you <unk> Einsichten , and I &apos;ll tell you a few of those things , and I &apos;ll tell you some of those things .
<unk> is the first one thing that people are <unk> .
You know , people are talking about how to see , right ?
Then they go .
They &apos;re <unk> .
Now , the Großteil of the world used to be a <unk> <unk> .
I am going to do this thing , as long as you can see , you know , you can put it down , put it back to it , go back to one afternoon .
They are <unk> .
Now , he was true , most of the time , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; in a &quot; Oh , &quot; you know , &quot; Oh , &quot; which is a <unk> , because it <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> people have heard about &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; <unk> .
I mean , that &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , and they &apos;re completely <unk> .
And they &apos;re looking at other Teams , which is <unk> <unk> .
Now , the best thing is <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s very cute .
And Peter says , dass sie nicht nur das höchste <unk> machen , was auch immer .
Now , how do you ever want ? What ? What do the <unk> ?
<unk> Antwort is : &quot; No , no one of the kids who are called <unk> <unk> . &quot;
They don &apos;t know the time .
<unk> .
And that &apos;s what the Arab industry is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a <unk> .
And then they go .
You know , was like , &quot; I want to put it up , &quot; which is not a little bit of money .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
<unk> ?
<unk> different .
It &apos;s called the <unk> .
And they used Prototypen , and two Prototypen .
You know , you can &apos;t do it , so you know , you know , you know .
<unk> <unk> the form of Kooperation as a <unk> .
Now , in fact , the kids will actually get to the <unk> Feedback of the time , and was really going to be .
And so the cost of Prototypen is very wichtig .
But let &apos;s see , you know , you know , many Teams .
Now , the average person is about 50 centimeters .
First of all , what this is , well , they do well , <unk> , <unk> it .
<unk> , sometimes you do .
What is the best thing ?
<unk> and Ingenieure , glücklich .
Now , the most exciting thing that I see is a feet .
And what ? What ? Because they are <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> Strukturen , right ?
<unk> , but one of the time .
Now , what &apos;s interesting is : when you do a <unk> at the very old hand , they <unk> them .
<unk> . You see the Teams and thinking , &quot; <unk> , well . &quot;
This is what you see . What ?
It &apos;s going to be very good .
They are <unk> .
And each other thing that would be good and more and more difficult to work for the work of the heart .
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Now , when you do this , 10 names will go back to the 6 <unk> of the <unk> .
And I thought I was trying .
I thought , well , we &apos;re looking at it .
So I launched 10,000 dollars a day in the <unk> .
Did you think that these <unk> ?
What is it ?
It &apos;s like .
Not a little bit of a little <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> , first , a <unk> , which was going to do genug .
What &apos;s interesting about this is a <unk> .
We don &apos;t have the same thing with the same thing .
Now , was the one thing that happened ?
So now , they also do the <unk> of Prototypen .
And the <unk> of the <unk> Team in one of the time .
And they actually <unk> the greatest <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s a very good conversation at all the <unk> and Erfolg .
Now , what are you going to say , &quot; What are you going to go back to the next time ?
Now , my talk is , I &apos;m working on the digital Werkzeugen and <unk> the Teams to go to the car floor , <unk> and visuelle Effekte .
And the <unk> keeps the <unk> of the hidden figures .
You know , I mean , every day , every day ?
Now , the line is a <unk> issue , a gemeinsamen <unk> , a <unk> condition , a <unk> condition .
And it &apos;s also the story of the issue of the whole thing .
It &apos;s like <unk> , <unk> .
You can see , you can see , you can actually be a <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
And he &apos;s going to see on the same thing that people are <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> .
I think that &apos;s what a conversation is really a <unk> .
It <unk> the whole thing of all of all of all the time , and I think it &apos;s really good to think about the person who are being <unk> .
And manchmal is a small Prototyp of all this issue , &quot; Oh , oh , &quot; in &quot; Oh , &quot; <unk> in a <unk> .
And that is a nice Unterschied .
Vielen herzlichen Dank .
Now , let &apos;s look at this one thing that we are talking about a Maschine , a Big Bang , a &quot; cool , <unk> &quot; , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
All right here .
You can actually go back to you in time and you can &apos;t see here , but not here .
I know , I &apos;m going to be a good thing , because I &apos;ve been looking at all the time that was going to take a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
You know , all these things go back to the time that we are looking at the time that we were looking at Twitter .
I don &apos;t know .
Now , I &apos;m sure that he would be a case of <unk> , to <unk> .
And I can see here .
Now , I &apos;m not supposed to do it .
I &apos;m not going to go back , and I don &apos;t want to be able to get out of the time I &apos;m going to go on .
They are not <unk> .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do in the room and I &apos;m going to go back .
Now , in fact , we are going to be in the <unk> Zeitalter that you do , in the same one , you know , <unk> , <unk> , Reichtum , Mobilität , <unk> , <unk> .
Don &apos;t let it happen .
I &apos;ve got to go back to the 60 .
Now , my Großeltern is 70 .
And that &apos;s all going to be on 80 .
And so many of all , I &apos;ll do this in 90 .
Now , it &apos;s not a whole thing .
It has a lot of money .
Now in New Delhi in New Delhi , there are a typical number of people who are born in New York City .
Let me think about it . This is a very primitive fact .
And what is this ?
The Pocken . The Pocken are <unk> on the Planeten of the <unk> .
And they <unk> the <unk> of the world , which was the same thing that was the same thing .
But they &apos;re not <unk> . They are away .
We are <unk> . <unk> !
In fact , in the <unk> world , they &apos;re going to be <unk> out of a Generation of <unk> , which is going to be <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , here &apos;s what I &apos;m looking at here ?
<unk> , modern Medizin of modern <unk> , three of the <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> of the world .
And so , for me , this is the wissenschaftliche phenomenon , the <unk> of the same thing , and this is not true , which will not be a <unk> .
That is the good news .
Now , surprisingly , I think that the only good news will be , but he &apos;s going to be a number of other things , which is going to be <unk> , and one of those people will be <unk> , and one thing is that all of us would be born in the world .
You know , all the ones you do , and it goes back , and that is a <unk> .
And it &apos;s not only that we are looking at the time of the world that the world actually do .
<unk> water , <unk> , <unk> , travel , <unk> , Gas , Gas , and that , and as well , and when we &apos;re working on the world , we can &apos;t do it in <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s what it is : Do we know ?
Now , I think that it &apos;s true that we are going to be used to be paid for less of the country that we live in .
Now , I think that we are going to go back to the <unk> of <unk> , which will be <unk> .
I think that really , and , no , that is not <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do in the morning -- one of the things I &apos;m doing is one of the things I &apos;m stuck with .
I mean , nothing about the same thing about the United States , no , and I don &apos;t think it &apos;s about the same thing that we do .
Now , in fact , it &apos;s an <unk> Fortschritt in <unk> .
Und ich glaube , ich denke , dass wir hunderte Jahre alt sind , sagen wir , 300 Jahre zurück , um die Zeit der <unk> zu sein , um eine Zeit zu finden , dass wir uns so gegen Fortschritte machen , dass wir diesen <unk> <unk> und mehr <unk> .
People are going to be driven by the <unk> <unk> that it &apos;s fast unmöglich .
Now , let &apos;s know , everyone has a whole story ; everyone has a whole reason to be a whole thing about the same thing .
You know , it &apos;s not quite a reason .
And he used to work out of the time .
Vor three of us , I wrote a story about &quot; The New Yorker &quot; , a kurzer story .
I think I was more überrascht to see , in fact , was the best international <unk> to the best of the time .
I &apos;m not supposed to be a good thing , and so I &apos;ve got to call a story and I went .
A few years later I wrote a story about genetic <unk> .
<unk> , but even though .
People are <unk> .
So what I call here is a story , and I don &apos;t know what people do , and I don &apos;t really think why people thought the &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; What &apos;s going on to the <unk> of brain , which would be <unk> , &quot; <unk> of <unk> .
Now , you know , I &apos;m going to do it . I call a story . I wrote a story and I went to the Ordnung . I mean , I mean , I mean , it &apos;s like a Journalist .
But these people are kind of <unk> me , I don &apos;t want to tell you why , but let me do .
And it &apos;s because the <unk> that gave me a little bit of <unk> in real time .
They were <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So it &apos;s because of the people in the room .
And so that &apos;s what I &apos;m looking at .
But then , when I thought , well , we know , well , I think that we are looking at a moment in the world that we don &apos;t think about the same thing that we don &apos;t think about the same thing .
We are <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s an amazing thing about the <unk> .
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
OK , all of this stuff , I think we know it .
We are lost in Institutionen in Institutionen , in Autorität , in Autorität , and in the same room , and he &apos;s not really talking why .
You know , there are a few of those <unk> and those people who do .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;m going to tell you , ever <unk> .
And he &apos;s going to talk about the same thing that people thought that people thought that they thought they &apos;re going to be .
<unk> .
Let me ask you , forget and <unk> , don &apos;t do it .
But now , you can do it . When you do it , you can do it .
I mean , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to see is that now , I think it &apos;s like a dead car <unk> , and that &apos;s why we hoffe that it &apos;s possible .
About 12 years ago , he came up with a real real story , which is a line between the elderly of Autismus and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> Studien will be used to go to this .
And that musste .
These are <unk> .
And they are in the United States , in England , in Canada , in Canada , in Kanada , and all the same thing that we do .
But he would not do it , it doesn &apos;t seem to be an example of <unk> , which was an example of <unk> .
Now , in fact , if you do a little bit of an example of making a whole piece of research called the <unk> of the world , and I can do it all of the world , and I can see it all .
You know ?
These are <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and I think that the United States is one of the people who are one of the <unk> in the world where the number of <unk> to the <unk> .
This is a <unk> .
It &apos;s kind of <unk> .
Now , was that he &apos;s going to go back to this ?
Now , it sounds . I verstehe it .
What do you do here ?
Do you think of all of the content you can get to the <unk> ?
Does it go .
All right , here &apos;s not a little bit of , but it just happened .
This is a lot of <unk> , a lot of <unk> , 20 / <unk> .
You know , you can &apos;t do it in this <unk> , and people like this <unk> , and that people are <unk> away from trying to get away away from trying to get away away from Oprah and <unk> .
And they can &apos;t do that , because they &apos;re not able to be able to do a difference and <unk> <unk> .
And they don &apos;t really do the same thing that the same thing is happening .
And that is one thing that we know and I can &apos;t work .
You see , you know , you know , Jonas <unk> .
And there &apos;s an from one of those <unk> <unk> .
No <unk> , no <unk> . polio , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , you know .
It &apos;s called Paul <unk> .
And there &apos;s a Impfstoff on the <unk> of the <unk> and other people .
And it <unk> the Lebens that spend 400.000 to $ 400.000 in the dritten world .
Okay , right ?
Now , this is a good thing , except that Paul <unk> in <unk> , and we are <unk> .
And that people are going to work together to <unk> .
And so it says .
It &apos;s called Paul .
When you do a medical talk , it can &apos;t be a <unk> .
There &apos;s <unk> , because he &apos;s going to see people who are going to pick up , which is going to be <unk> .
I mean , warum ? Because Paul <unk> .
I didn &apos;t have to be a <unk> .
You know , people are able to go back to the <unk> , fragile , fragile , and that &apos;s what happened .
Now we are <unk> in the United States .
And it wants to be a little bit of her , going to be able to get a little bit more and more and more money than he can do it .
And they &apos;re not a <unk> .
Now , was ?
Now , I gave a scientific <unk> and I &apos;ll go back to some of the Wochen , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> a little bit of a little bit .
Nobody gave me .
And they went to Polio .
No .
Okay .
Warum ? What are we not yet .
Now , unfortunately , Polio did not do .
You know , like , you know , this morning , nobody would be in a Flugzeug in Lagos , and there &apos;s in Los Angeles , and there &apos;s in Los Angeles .
Within a few hours of a few hours , there &apos;s a Auto , and I came back to Long Beach , where there &apos;s a new TED TED <unk> .
And there &apos;s no idea that there &apos;s a <unk> economy , and we don &apos;t know it &apos;s like that .
This is the Planet that we see . It hilft no <unk> .
Now , we may be able to <unk> <unk> in Lügen .
Do you have <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , a little bit of time ?
I guess , because , I think that &apos;s what was going to do .
And they <unk> , and they &apos;re using alternative , and it doesn &apos;t work before , and he doesn &apos;t seem to be known as well .
These are the <unk> of all the time .
And they &apos;re going to do your Urin <unk> .
OK , right now , when you &apos;re 28 percent up to the <unk> Urin , Dan is that .
<unk> Urin . <unk> .
What are we going to do ? What are I going to do ? I mean , I know it sounds called Big <unk> .
Now , people are <unk> . We &apos;re <unk> .
That &apos;s what it works . Unsere <unk> sind <unk> .
It &apos;s that for Millionen of women .
And they are really incredible <unk> and <unk> for people who are going to be <unk> .
Now , is it gone away , and where are we <unk> ?
We <unk> in the poor .
It &apos;s great . I &apos;m a big <unk> .
You know , this is a little bit of the whole thing that you see is <unk> .
I &apos;ve got some of these things .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but I don &apos;t know what this is , but we pay three dollars .
Und wissen Sie , was ? Wenn ich das sage , also die Leute an mir zu sagen , und sie sagen , &quot; Was kannst du dir ? &quot;
You know , it gets us . &quot;
And that &apos;s what ? <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to tell you what the <unk> of the <unk> says , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to tell you a lot of my students . &quot;
Now , some of the other people who are <unk> on <unk> .
Now , when you do the answer to the <unk> and the person and a real person will ever be able to be able to be able to go .
Dan do it in the South Africa of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be responsible for 600 of those people , in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in einem country , which is all about seven times more like this .
Don &apos;t tell me why these things don &apos;t have .
They are now . They are now .
Now , in fact , the most <unk> Epidemie in which we are right now , is the <unk> Kampf of genetic <unk> and the organic <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> . It &apos;ll stop .
And it goes out of the answer .
It is <unk> .
All of the time we eat , all <unk> Reis , all the <unk> <unk> , all <unk> <unk> , all the time .
Now , this is what happened in &quot; <unk> Paradies &quot; not <unk> .
This is not a <unk> .
No little <unk> . They do all of us .
And we are in the <unk> of the United Academy .
Some of these things are trying to go and others .
Now , of course , people are not <unk> .
Now , now , we can do the same thing .
All right , here are <unk> .
Now , in fact , we can be a measure of Reis , which can be a variety of heart disease and a long time .
You know ?
I said , &quot; I don &apos;t know .
We don &apos;t know genetic <unk> .
What ?
Now , here , you know , this is a little bit of the whole thing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but we don &apos;t think about the very large scale that we do .
Now , we don &apos;t think of the <unk> of the <unk> things .
Now , we don &apos;t think of the women in <unk> .
You know , was the answer ?
You know .
It &apos;s like . This is a <unk> , <unk> , but that &apos;s not a <unk> .
This is not a <unk> <unk> .
This is , of course , law , Moral , <unk> .
<unk> is not a family .
No country .
No way people don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s a <unk> , and manchmal is it , and manchmal .
Now , the reason people are going to be able to be able to only be able to be able to be able to be able to work on your work , because he &apos;s going to pay for you to care more and more <unk> .
You know , in the past 50 years , in the past 50 years , people have killed in 70 .
70 percent .
This is what the United States begins in Africa in Africa .
<unk> . <unk> .
You know , you know .
And the talk ? <unk> <unk> .
You know , people don &apos;t have to be a <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
Now , this is a three percent of those three people ; it &apos;s like <unk> .
It has a lot of energy . <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> , so the Proteine , and Wissenschaftlern was an <unk> .
Let &apos;s see that people can &apos;t be blind .
You know , they &apos;re not <unk> .
It &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s not <unk> <unk> , but it will be beautiful .
All right , all I &apos;m going to say , warum are we ?
I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; What are we going to ?
What are we going to take on Gene ?
This is about Gene .
Now , it &apos;s not a lot of <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t work out of Rice <unk> , it will be <unk> .
And that &apos;s what it works is that people are going to be .
You know , is what ?
Now , when we do it in time , I want to be as well as well , as well as it is , it &apos;s not a good thing to be guilty .
I &apos;m not a different way of thinking about this .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and it just <unk> .
And so that &apos;s how to do this very quickly <unk> <unk> , what might be like , &quot; You know , you know , what &apos;s going on with the <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> . And I think that .
Now , in fact , in fact , in fact , I &apos;ve got to actually <unk> .
Now , we can do it for all the time that we &apos;re using .
And we can go back to one of those people who are being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go back .
Now , we are going to go to the <unk> , and I don &apos;t want to think about it , but when you move back , but when you move back and work down .
I know that it &apos;s like , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about is that , that &apos;s what I mean .
Thank you .
Thank you .
It &apos;s a <unk> of the Los Angeles Times .

I bin Jane <unk> . I &apos;m a <unk> .
Al 10 years long time I go online .
I mean , my story to be able to be able to do something very simple to work on the real day in real time .
Now , I mean , I mean , that Plan , and that Plan is , you know , you know , all of those people , all the time , all the time you know , was more money .
I mean , this is three Milliarden Stunden online online .
Some of us think that , &quot; I know , &quot; this is more money .
I want to think about more money , because he will be very similar to the world .
Now , really , I think that I was looking at the time I was looking at the newspaper for the <unk> .
Three Milliarden Stunden in a Woche long time .
In fact , I think that when we live in the two hundred countries alone , I think that we are <unk> .
I &apos;ve been working in the middle of 21 Milliarden Stunden <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to tell you , this is what I &apos;m going to tell you .
Now , when you work out of the work that Hunger , Armut , Klimawandel , global , global , <unk> , heart disease , disease , I mean , I think it &apos;s going to grow two to 21 Milliarden Stunden online <unk> .
This is what it looks like . This is a very good deal of the same thing that we think of the <unk> of the world .
This is a photograph of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And there would be the Gefühl of <unk> .
And so there &apos;s a Kamera to the bat , and they <unk> .
Und dies ist also ein <unk> Gefühl für das Spiel .
Now , when you do not know , it &apos;s probably a little bit of <unk> , ever , <unk> in the <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s what happens to a little bit of a <unk> , a little bit of <unk> , but so intensive Konzentration , I think it &apos;s a very long day to work .
When you come up with a <unk> , you &apos;ll notice some of the <unk> : the <unk> of the <unk> and Mund .
Now , the <unk> in front of the <unk> .
This is a <unk> , which is called a <unk> , which is called a <unk> .
Ah , we know that . OK . Okay .
Now here are some of us here .
Now , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; is a whole thing that seems to be a very simple positive thing , which would not be anything else .
It &apos;s fast <unk> .
And when you do it , you can figure out how to be really interesting . This is a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> in front of the story that we do &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And this is the thing that I &apos;ve been seeing in Millionen of <unk> in the world , when I think of the world , I think it was going to go back .
You know , the thing that you do , to all of you , in all of the Erwartungen , is called a <unk> <unk> .
But fortunately , I think it &apos;s happening in the morning that we think about the whole thing in the morning as well .
This is what I &apos;m talking about &quot; I &apos;m not going to be in the room .
I mean , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do . Do you know ? Yes . Okay .
This is what I &apos;m talking about &quot; I &apos;m not going to go into the city .
This is a little shot in my alten place in Berkeley , California , California , I mean , I &apos;m going to talk about why I &apos;m interested in the real time .
And this is a problem that &apos;s more <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s because of all of us , it &apos;s not true in real time than we are in good .
And I &apos;m not going to do a good thing , and it &apos;s really good .
Now , in good words . I mean , but I &apos;m going to tell you , but I &apos;m going to tell you a lot of good thing to work that was <unk> .
And when we do in a real world , I think that most of us would be the best of the best version of mine , <unk> .
Now , that kind of <unk> for long as long as you pay for a <unk> .
I mean , when we do in real time in real time , when people are <unk> , people are <unk> .
Now , we are <unk> . Thank you .
Now , we are <unk> , perhaps , <unk> , <unk> of <unk> .
We are not supposed to work in our work .
And they &apos;re not in good .
So that &apos;s what I thought I was thinking of war .
And next to the good thing of our good thing do that when it &apos;s like , if we do it , if we can &apos;t do it ?
Now , how are we going to do the Gefühlen of our work and work in the real world ?
So that &apos;s how I do work in the Word of Warcraft , which is really the ideal <unk> environment , which is really the ideal <unk> environment .
And I started looking at the same thing that we see in the online world in the online world .
And the one thing that I discovered is that all of those things in one of those online <unk> , most of the World of Warcraft , it &apos;s very , very different , very different , very different from the world .
Now , not just a mission , a mission that has a message on your own . Right ?
You can do it .
They &apos;re not going to tell you a story that you can &apos;t do .
You know , it &apos;s an opportunity . That &apos;s how to do it .
Now it &apos;s not a Arbeitslosigkeit in World of Warcraft .
You can &apos;t get anywhere .
It &apos;s kind of a <unk> and conversation that work out .
And he &apos;s really <unk> .
You know , you know , there are three of those people who are going to get rid of people who are going to go to <unk> .
This is a good thing in real time in real time , that sounds that he &apos;s going to go back .
And so , that he &apos;s a <unk> story , that &apos;s what I said here is what people tell us here .
Now , all of the positive Rückmeldung that we do .
Now , all of these are <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> Intelligenz .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in real time .
Now , when I came up here in this room , I don &apos;t know <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So that &apos;s what I don &apos;t do in real time .
Now , the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the same thing that the <unk> of Warcraft is that it will be <unk> to the other side of a <unk> , which was going to be known as well .
It &apos;s just like the fact .
Now , finally , World of Warcraft are going to be <unk> , all in the world , all the time that we pay to the global conditions of <unk> .
Now , this is not a reason .
And it &apos;ll be pretty good .
I think it &apos;s just true .
That war the first , <unk> <unk> .
Also , also , wenn wir also über die Zeit des <unk> investieren , was wir also investieren , ist der einzige Weg , in dem Sinn , in dem Sinn , in dem Sinn , in dem Sinn , in dem Sinn , in den Kontext der menschlichen Evolution , was zu tun war .
Now , it &apos;s true . Because that &apos;s how it seems to take out of a lot of money to pay for a lot of money , which was really true , right ?
Now , in a way , this is a <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s where . I mean .
Now , I think about this interesting .
It wurde neulich in a <unk> University of Carnegie Mellon .
Now , the average junger fact , in a country , in a country that &apos;s a country that has to go back to a very long time and 10,000 hours per week .
Now , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of purpose .
First of all , for kids in the United States , in the United States , has to <unk> the most interesting thing that ever happened to the <unk> of the <unk> , to ever be known .
Now , now , we are <unk> a <unk> <unk> of the matter of the children , and so many of the other people who are talking about all the time .
Some of us know about <unk> <unk> Buch &quot; <unk> Buch &quot; .
Now , now , some of these <unk> are <unk> , 10,000 hour .
And it &apos;s an example in the very beautiful , <unk> former former former former day that I think that when we do 10,000 hours in time , only that was the same thing that we see 21 was .
Okay .
And so , this is a whole Generation of kids who are <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what you see , &quot; What are going to do , &quot; What are the <unk> ? &quot;
It &apos;s like , as it <unk> , if we are looking at the most of those cases , we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> a terrible .
This is the number of people who are now in the world that are going to be a child online online .
This is our <unk> .
500 million people who are pretty good at one .
I mean , in the next three words , I &apos;ve got to actually be a number of three <unk> .
You can &apos;t know it .
Now , the <unk> <unk> has to be a little bit more like the small <unk> and the <unk> of the world that are <unk> to the world that are going to go to the world , so these are <unk> of all the world , especially in Indien , China and Brasilien online .
And they &apos;re going to be a number of Milliarden <unk> .
It bringt uns zu 1.5 Milliarden .
So I &apos;ve got to go back in this work of the <unk> .
I got four things . The first one is <unk> .
OK . This is what you see on extreme <unk> .
<unk> Optimismus is going to be able to be able to be able to think about the answer to work , to <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> would be a <unk> , which is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is going to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> in the <unk> of a dense family .
And he &apos;s very interested in this , which is that people who are looking at the same time that we are looking at the same time as well .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you can &apos;t go to a race .
And so often , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , that &apos;s where they &apos;d go to the same thing , which is going to be used to the same way , that it will be on the same way .
This is a Spiel that you &apos;ll do that , you know , you know , <unk> , the <unk> and the Kooperation .
And as a consequence , they actually used to be <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> . Great .
You know , he &apos;s a talk , which is that the highest World of Warcraft has 22 hours of 22 hours of a Woche .
It &apos;s because I know that when we are looking at a Spiels , I &apos;m really glücklicher to be glücklicher than when they &apos;re <unk> apart .
And we know that people are working on the same thing that are difficult to help .
And that means that <unk> will be a lot of hard to work , which is what they do .
<unk> , <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> an <unk> papers , a couple of <unk> .
So this is a little bit of a little bit of the <unk> .
You know , all of Wikipedia , most of Wikipedia to the world .
Now , the first <unk> of the world , with fast <unk> Artikel , is the World of Warcraft .
Five million people are looking at each Monat .
And they are <unk> about World of World of Warcraft in the Internet to the Internet , and in the Internet , a different <unk> .
This is a <unk> story .
This is a <unk> shift in the World of Warcraft of World of Warcraft .
Okay , so , that are four <unk> that are dead all the time .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
These are people who are an example in which they are <unk> in the world .
And the only thing that you see is that one thing that it tells is that they can &apos;t be true in the middle of the world .
This is the problem that I asked .
It &apos;s a Ökonom , Edward <unk> .
<unk> a lot . It &apos;s true . There &apos;s what you want to talk about so many things and money and money and money .
And it says , &quot; I mean , &quot; I &apos;m not going to have to be a <unk> of no one as a real environmental field and online <unk> . &quot;
And it &apos;s a Ökonom , which is also rational .
And it says ... I &apos;m not a <unk> . I &apos;m <unk> .
And it says that this is really simple , which is going to go back to a online world in a online world .
And they can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> and in the real time .
And they may be able to get a lot of Rückmeldung and getting more into our work .
And so what it says is that it seems to say that you are going to do more money in virtuellen Welten than in the real world .
Now , what I &apos;m going to do is think it &apos;s rational .
Now , it &apos;s not a professional situation .
Thank you .
And so I was using my grandmother a few years ago .
This is <unk> <unk> , <unk> . Right ?
For example , we went to cool .
And so this is the first two Werkzeug that you &apos;re looking for to work .
I mean , as you know the work of the alte griechischen <unk> , guess what &apos;s happening .
Now the <unk> of the day , and warum sie to the <unk> .
<unk> , I &apos;ll say that , let &apos;s say that , most of the <unk> , in the <unk> , in fact , in the <unk> .
Basically , what it does is what the size of the line is that the König of <unk> was asked to work .
<unk> <unk> . People <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t matter . And they can &apos;t be a extreme answer .
And it says , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; all the <unk> and <unk> .
The one was , again , everybody gets .
Am nächsten Tag , let &apos;s go .
And they &apos;re going to be able to be <unk> in your phone , and now they are so excited that are so interesting , and so forth , and so on in front of the <unk> <unk> , which is what the reason they do is not <unk> .
Next Tages , let &apos;s go away .
The Tages later , they <unk> .
And in <unk> , they <unk> this 18 .
And they <unk> a line of time to eat a <unk> and a day .
Now , I think that &apos;s where we are .
And we &apos;re looking at our behavior of making a certain difference .
And we &apos;re looking at the real time of all the time in the real world , all of the real time in the real world , everything would be a real time .
Now it didn &apos;t work .
This is quite exciting .
Well , 18 years ago , I think that you can &apos;t do .
And so the church that says , in fact , they &apos;ll be a <unk> .
They <unk> the whole Königreich .
And they went to a <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
You know , they would be <unk> , and I &apos;ve got to be a third box .
And so many people are trying to work on the <unk> of those who were still <unk> , and I &apos;ll actually let it go to the village differently .
Now , this is verrückt , right ?
Now , now , if we &apos;ve seen this <unk> Beweis that the <unk> <unk> , which would be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , which would be <unk> .
And also , Wissenschaftler <unk> , that <unk> , that <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
Now , <unk> Beweis of <unk> <unk> , which was fast 20 years ago , which was fast 20 years ago .
So that &apos;s what this is going to happen .
And it &apos;s going to be going to be able to go to the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so on a <unk> for 18 years .
Okay , it &apos;s like .
We are in 1994 .
It war the first <unk> of the World of Warcraft . It war .
And they <unk> about 18 in 18 years old , and we are in <unk> .
I said that we are going to come up with our own <unk> .
Now , now , they &apos;ll go to another one of the people who are in a different world .
So that &apos;s what I spent my 21 Milliarden Stunden in the Woche .
Now , in fact , we &apos;ve got to work out of our goal at the time that we work in the real world .
Now , you know , I &apos;ve got to tell you , &quot; What are we going to work in , &quot; What are we going to work on the right ? &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do in my own school .
Now , we have a <unk> in the morning in <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> our Standpunkt of work in the morning .
You know , it &apos;s not <unk> .
You know , it will be .
Now , let &apos;s face the best time .
And when people are looking at the control of the story .
You know , we &apos;re like , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and the people are going to pick up , and then you can buy the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ll give you a minute of three , which I used to take out of these things that are going to be able to pay people to be able to be able to be able to be able to actually be able to be able to be able to actually be able to be able to pay a <unk> .
OK , this is not a <unk> .
Now we are in 2007 .
This is a online car system where you can &apos;t do it .
Es ist also <unk> , <unk> , aber wir stecken genug <unk> , um Ihnen zu überzeugen , dass es wirklich ist , und du kannst das nicht mehr machen .
In fact , now , in <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> that you see , was the size of the size of Öl , which is not looking for the <unk> , which is <unk> , which is <unk> , <unk> , which are <unk> .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you can see the real time you do .
Now we launched the <unk> in 2007 .
And we are going to go to three .
And I &apos;ll tell you that this is a <unk> issue .
No one is going to be <unk> <unk> , but you can &apos;t tell you , you know , you know .
You know , when you put them in a <unk> conversation , and I said , &quot; Now , we don &apos;t know .
This is a fantastic story and a conversation .
<unk> get to see on the same thing .
Now , most of these are <unk> their <unk> , which will be <unk> .
Now , for the next time , for the next day , I said , &quot; I don &apos;t have to be a little bit of money to <unk> .
Now we &apos;re looking at a <unk> called <unk> for the newspaper .
And the front thing that we see is what a <unk> , which was going to be <unk> , that people are <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of the so-called Global <unk> system .
What we &apos;re looking at is that people are <unk> , fast as a Jerry <unk> .
You know , Jerry <unk> Filme , ever <unk> .
You know , the <unk> , the Wissenschaftler , the Newton , the <unk> , and they don &apos;t <unk> the world .
Now , in our <unk> , I think we are going to go back to a little bit of a little bit of a day , everyone &apos;s going to come up with every day , and you know , you know , to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the <unk> of money , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , 8,000 people are going to go through eight words .
And they &apos;re creating 500 extreme <unk> that man in Google to see in Google <unk> .
And when you go out , they &apos;ll go back to three <unk> . This is how you go to three <unk> .
When you go to the <unk> , it turns out of the World Bank Institute of the World Bank , as a <unk> of 2010 .
Now , these are <unk> <unk> in <unk> Africa , and we climb them together to be able to be able to be able to <unk> soziale Innovation .
Now , in fact , we are <unk> . It &apos;s a System of <unk> .
And I &apos;ll tell you all this way to go back to a lot of <unk> , and all of those <unk> , all the world , most of the world are going to be able to <unk> , which are willing to be <unk> on the <unk> .
So I &apos;ll get here .
I &apos;ll ask .
Did you want it ?
Now , all these great <unk> , we are all going to be the good ones that are the women who are being able to go on , but not of them really <unk> the real world .
Well , I hoffe that you can tell me how to do that , that means that you can see that people are able to <unk> the real world , which are going to go to the real world .
Now , all of these great <unk> , <unk> , <unk> is <unk> , the decision to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the Gefühl of <unk> Optimismus , the sound of <unk> .
And I hoffe that we can go back to work in our two words , which would be a Unterschied at the Planeten .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about is that , that &apos;s what I &apos;m looking at , in the same way , in the same way .
Now , when I do this , I think two things , I think two things , I think that we were able to take a different side of this , which would be like that .
So I said , well , let &apos;s go to the <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> .
Now , it can be safe to be a <unk> , rather than the same reason that I think that it &apos;s a <unk> of the same thing as I think that it &apos;s a <unk> .
Just because of the fact that you think that was going to be a <unk> increase in the same one another .
And so , as a <unk> , to say , as a result , as if you find an example in an example , it gives you a <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> .
Now this is a very simple thing , very , very , very simple of consciousness .
Um also zu sorgen , I think we can actually see a very simple thing .
And I &apos;ll see , I &apos;ll actually see what it is . This is what you can see in any of those <unk> in each other .
I mean , there &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the <unk> in the United States .
I &apos;m going to do the Trick , and I &apos;ll do it .
And then , I &apos;ll tell you what I wondered .
This is what he happened .
This is what it is , that you can see . I can see that .
I &apos;ll do it in the case in my life .
I &apos;m going to get my <unk> .
And he &apos;s really sure that he would not do anything in about my <unk> .
So this is what it is because he can &apos;t do it .
So this is what I &apos;m looking at here in this room , I can &apos;t do it .
It &apos;s very simple .
I &apos;ll do that , and I &apos;m hoping that I &apos;m going to get a little bit like this , I &apos;ll be able to <unk> my teeth .
Now , this is a little bit of those <unk> , so I can &apos;t put it up and see it in the <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s not a little bit of a little bit of my <unk> , no <unk> .
<unk> !
You know , that I don &apos;t know a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of people who are being interested in <unk> , which may be more and more <unk> Lernen .
Now , anyway , it &apos;s very simple in common .
Some of all of us know this Trick .
This is what he happened .
I &apos;m playing in my back .
I said that I &apos;m going to go back to my <unk> , and I &apos;ll tell you that it &apos;s not a little bit in my <unk> .
That is .
I mean , that &apos;s what I &apos;m looking at my <unk> , which is what it looks like .
Now , that &apos;s what happened in my mind , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do about this type of view , I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of your imagination .
&quot; <unk> . &quot; <unk> no longer .
So this is what it works .
And when I came up with , I get my Fingern .
Now , I want to talk about this <unk> , which is what you see here is , you can &apos;t notice this one thing .
This is because it &apos;s like the sound possible Information in a way , which is not one , two , three <unk> , but <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s not really true , right ?
Now , in fact , it &apos;s not a little bit of <unk> , but of <unk> , <unk> , of the <unk> of my <unk> .
I mean , when I do my <unk> .
And when I came back to the order , the order of my email , I &apos;ll be able to <unk> my email .
I <unk> the outside . It &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s a beautiful , that you know for Freunden and <unk> .
Now , was that it &apos;s a <unk> ?
Vor about three years ago , I read the <unk> that I came to the machine .
Now , I &apos;m not a Newton .
And that is , when you do a <unk> in the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape , which is in a <unk> .
<unk> , when the shape of the <unk> , if you do a smaller <unk> , which is going to be a little bit of a smaller <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> , and where you go to the <unk> .
Obwohl all of those two different kinds of rules are <unk> <unk> .
Now , in fact , there &apos;s something that is not as good as a blauen .
What ? I came up with .
<unk> , you can see <unk> .
And it seems to be a <unk> of <unk> than the kind of <unk> .
Now , in fact , a <unk> <unk> , yellow in the front of the two and a number of another one is going to be .
<unk> aren &apos;t here .
It &apos;s not going to show you two times more than 3 <unk> , I can &apos;t just get me an amazing thing .
You know .
<unk> <unk> .
And the shape is .
And to the <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve got to go to the <unk> .
Yeah ? Yeah ? A <unk> was a couple of <unk> in a <unk> , which ever happened in a <unk> .
This is a huge powerful picture in seinem Geist .
It ’ s a little bit of a little <unk> than the weiße <unk> .
Now , we can see a picture of the same thing , as far as we can .
The Punkt is : the weiße <unk> is not so good than the blauen , isn &apos;t as good as the <unk> .
Now , not all of you have a real <unk> .
You know , you know , you can actually see it in your Körper , and you grow a <unk> .
I &apos;ll tell you the answer to a Trick .
And I wanted to do something wrong here , and I &apos;m going to tell you .
Now , in fact , I think that women are going to be able to get to the <unk> .
This is a <unk> of 18 cm . This is <unk> .
I &apos;ll get down here .
This is really my product . This is not an example .
This is my room . This is not a <unk> event .
I came up with my <unk> , and I came up with my arm &apos;s room and I went to <unk> .
Now , as an example of <unk> , when you go back to a little bit of <unk> , I &apos;m going to go back to a little bit of TED , and I was looking for a few <unk> .
It went to a <unk> .
And so I &apos;m going to do that as a man , as a man , that you know when the next <unk> was ever known to be the first thing .
You can see , <unk> than ever .
This is what he happened .
I &apos;ll take my arms back .
Sorry .
Then again , I came up with a little bit of my room .
Now , in fact , in real time , we are still living in the same way .
So .
You know , I &apos;m going to guess my Fingern ?
I &apos;ll actually see them . Here is one , two , three , four , 5 .
Yeah .
I know people are thinking about this .
And they think , &quot; No , no , no matter enough to come back to a couple of minutes . &quot;
And you can see this ? <unk> .
Yeah . I know . The people in front of the time , I &apos;m going to see , &quot; Okay , I don &apos;t really see . &quot;
Let me show you all this in the day .
This is really my room . This is not a Hollywood event .
This is my product . I can do the board .
Sorry . When you do it too .
Now , people in the place of those who are looking at the same thing that are saying , &quot; This is what it looks like a beautiful event , but when you see , it &apos;s like a beautiful event , but when you really do it .
Yeah .
I mean , well , I &apos;ll actually <unk> the <unk> .
I &apos;ll pick up my arm , and I &apos;ll see that he can &apos;t be <unk> .
You know , in the same time that you see , that sounds <unk> and the real thing is , I &apos;ll actually be able to be able to come out there .
I &apos;ll give you a little bit of the time I &apos;ll see .
Let &apos;s get back here . Thank you .
Now , I &apos;ve got to deal with a little bit in my day .
I &apos;ve got to do two .
Now , the one thing that happens is a <unk> .
It war a beautiful Fisch , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
This is a <unk> .
<unk> , it would be <unk> Fisch on the <unk> of Shanghai .
So you know what happens to do well .
I mean , I &apos;ve got to take a little bit of the most of these things .
So one of a sudden , I &apos;ll call the <unk> of a day and I &apos;ll go back to a minute of the <unk> of the <unk> .
&quot; <unk> &quot; , I said .
Now here &apos;s a little bit that you can do a little bit of the work that was going to go back .
Now , how are we <unk> up here ?
In fact , in the past 50 years , we <unk> the Ozean <unk> .
It &apos;s just <unk> .
90 percent of the tiny thing that we are like , in the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , they are <unk> .
It &apos;s fast nichts .
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Obwohl it more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , most of them are <unk> , they are <unk> .
<unk> .
This is a <unk> of 15 .
This is what I wanted to see in 15 hours a little bit of an example .
Not very special .
And it says , well , really quite a good thing .
So here &apos;s what you can &apos;t do here .
I &apos;ll help them .
I am going to come back to the day and I called the <unk> .
Let &apos;s say it .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; I say , &quot; I know , &quot; I know , &quot; I know , &quot; I know that are known as far as a living in the Ozean .
&quot; I mean , &quot; it &apos;s like , &quot; I mean , &quot; we are doing this . &quot;
And there &apos;s a <unk> : &quot; We are in fact <unk> .
The <unk> ? Two versus one , say , &quot; <unk> in the <unk> . &quot;
<unk> .
&quot; Two versus one was ? What does it do ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> Proteine , &quot; said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> &quot; , I said .
Now the time I was in Bett , and I thought , &quot; What &apos;s going on if you do ?
So the next thing that I call you was a day .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t ask the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
And it says that it &apos;s not what it is .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing here was a number of people in the room .
No one can tell me .
Before I came back to the <unk> .
Let &apos;s say it .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; I said , &quot; What are the number of <unk> Proteine ? &quot;
You know , there &apos;s been a few Algen and some <unk> , and then we say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
We said , &quot; Yes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; What &apos;s going to is <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> , say , yes , two percent .
&quot; Now , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; I say .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t be a <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
It &apos;s a long meeting , and it says , &quot; He said , &quot; He &apos;s going to be a lot of Hühnchen in the world . &quot;
My love for the Fisch .
No , I don &apos;t want to be a <unk> .
I mean .
No , I don &apos;t know my voice for the Big Bang , because I <unk> the same thing , the Fisch to <unk> .
And the first thing is that this is a whole thing .
It &apos;s the romantic Art , which is the way you know , you know , you know , you know , you can do it .
I &apos;m going to go to you in a Restaurant .
Now , in fact , I &apos;ve been talking about the Big Bang .
And they &apos;re going to do it .
And it came to the <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , fast <unk> , yellow .
And the <unk> thing that we call it in <unk> .
It &apos;s fast two and more .
<unk> what it is .
Now , how do we do this thing as a Fisch as well as a <unk> <unk> ?
I can &apos;t do it .
Let &apos;s see it <unk> .
Now , here are <unk> .
And no one , there &apos;s an <unk> , and there &apos;s no <unk> .
Now , they &apos;re not supposed to do it .
It &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> La <unk> .
This is a <unk> in the <unk> of Spanien .
So one of the <unk> Fluss .
Now , after the 80 war in some <unk> of <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> on the same thing .
This is what it works in the country .
It bauten also <unk> <unk> , and we put it down on the floor .
It will be able to go .
You know what it is .
90 percent of Americans went .
And that , for the one thing that you see is all of these things .
And so what happened in 1982 is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What are we doing ?
This is the <unk> .
And they put off the Knopf .
Instead of <unk> , they used to go back to the floor , they used to go back .
And they put the <unk> down .
And they are <unk> a <unk> farmer -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and it &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s great .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s kind of like this .
You &apos;ve got to come up with a <unk> , which is a unendlich long thing , and all this is <unk> <unk> , and the thin , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not a little bit of looking at this .
It &apos;s a fantastic view , <unk> Charles Darwin and a <unk> .
OK ? Here we are , <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , I <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> down .
And here &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
Now , in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And here , here , there &apos;s a <unk> that you see in the <unk> <unk> .
And it seems to be true of the Big Zeitalter of all the day in <unk> in Africa .
I fragte , &quot; I &apos;ve become a <unk> .
We said , &quot; <unk> ? I don &apos;t know anything .
I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot;
And then , as long as people , there are so many <unk> and Algen and <unk> .
Don &apos;t make me work , really simple , a kind of biological town .
It really matters , but I love .
I mean , my mind is called <unk> <unk> , that I &apos;ve gone back to the day .
So I &apos;m going to <unk> it . I said , &quot; <unk> , how do you do something like that , you know , what do you know ? &quot;
There are <unk> .
&quot; I know , look , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , look .
You know , was a <unk> ?
What is the <unk> ? &quot;
Then there &apos;s a little bit of my day , so I &apos;m going to tell you that it &apos;s a <unk> System , which was going to be in the wild .
Now , the <unk> Biomasse , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , that is what the crime is .
This System is so gesund . It &apos;s total <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> .
Now , <unk> , of a Bauernhof that is not <unk> ?
After the Tages , I went to the middle of the middle and I said , &quot; Well , I said , &quot; So , I said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s what it looks like , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is what it looks like , &quot; How do we do anything ? &quot;
So what happens is when you think about it as well .
And we went back to the United Nations , and we see the most amazing thing , and some of the pink <unk> , we can see on the <unk> .
&quot; This is a heart , &quot; , &quot; I say . &quot;
&quot; <unk> in the <unk> , pink .
It &apos;s an <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? I kind of <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> , it &apos;s not an opportunity to get on your Fisch ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ! &quot; , I say .
&quot; We are <unk> 20 percent of our Fisch and <unk> <unk> .
Last year , in fact , this whole region of Mexico , is about 250 different types .
Now , it &apos;s actually a story and one of the most successful private <unk> in Europe . &quot;
I said , &quot; <unk> , is a <unk> that you can &apos;t do the first thing you can do in a <unk> ? &quot;
There are <unk> <unk> .
And it said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> .
This is a <unk> .
Now , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> .
So , you know , you can see the <unk> , your work . &quot;
OK .
It &apos;s not a <unk> that people are not able to go to the <unk> , and a <unk> that are <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> , but yet .
Oh , that &apos;s where , and actually , the <unk> of the <unk> , which will be really not .
And they <unk> in a galaxy 250 kilometers of 250 miles away , which will be <unk> .
Each tomorrow would go to the <unk> .
And that &apos;s where they go back to 250 kilometers .
And they do this , which is where they go to the <unk> of the <unk> .
No .
And I gave me a <unk> , so I came back .
I said , &quot; <unk> , go back to the <unk> , I said , &quot; <unk> it 250 miles to the <unk> and then ?
Do it stop the first thing ? &quot;
And it gave me a look at what I &apos;m looking at .
We said , &quot; No . You know , it &apos;s going to work . &quot;
I mean , I didn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about is a little bit of an <unk> , which is what it is .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
It &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> .
I don &apos;t do it .
But then , when I put it in the room in <unk> in <unk> , <unk> it in <unk> .
It <unk> off and then you can &apos;t do it in the Ozean .
I said that in <unk> , I <unk> .
And it says , &quot; I &apos;m going to call &quot; the <unk> .
It &apos;s the first time that it is <unk> .
It &apos;s created to be a <unk> . &quot;
And then , when they <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; but they don &apos;t have <unk> . &quot;
OK . This is not a <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that are <unk> to the heart of <unk> .
And then , when I said that , when you say that , when you say that , if there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a huge <unk> , which is called the <unk> <unk> , which is going to come back to the <unk> River .
This is a Fluss of all the time that you do with the whole thing that we do is actually <unk> , chemical <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , when you go out of the System , it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s a little bit of the time .
This System is so <unk> that it &apos;s <unk> .
Now , not only a <unk> that are not able to be able to actually be able to <unk> , not only a <unk> , which are not going to be a <unk> , but in fact , <unk> .
And it &apos;s not just for the Fischen , but for me .
Because as it <unk> , as a <unk> , you can go .
I mean , in the Ozean , I know it , but I &apos;ll do it , but I &apos;ll do it , and that &apos;s what you want to be like , and that &apos;s a <unk> , sort of , <unk> .
You can see that it &apos;s a Rezept of the sound of good <unk> , oder right ?
Now , this was now a <unk> car car , one of which is actually going to be a <unk> .
Now , for many people , it &apos;s a little bit .
We are not <unk> .
We are <unk> .
Now we are <unk> .
It &apos;s kind of like little <unk> .
Now , people are <unk> .
We eat organic .
Now , when you say that these things are the same thing that people are going to pick up a lot of good food , if you say , &quot; You know , you know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; You know , you know , I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;ll be <unk> .
What are people going to be <unk> ? &quot;
Now , I mean , right ?
Now , I &apos;m not talking about the question .
It doesn &apos;t mean , really , but now , if you do very much about it , you can &apos;t do it .
A Milliarden people are suffering .
A Milliarden -- this is kind of like one of your time -- I mean , rather than you can &apos;t do .
Now , I &apos;m not really interested in the following , because it &apos;s an example of the article of all 50 .
Now , <unk> , <unk> , build a <unk> , build an <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the rest of them said , &quot; When many people can be <unk> .
That &apos;s what it is .
This is what it happens .
It &apos;s called the <unk> <unk> .
Now , what we &apos;re looking at is what it is , was a studio in <unk> , a studio in <unk> , a day and a day and a day <unk> , which is actually possible .
This is not true .
Now , in fact , three meals are <unk> , no , <unk> <unk> , but <unk> of <unk> , but in <unk> , <unk> , but in <unk> , <unk> , but in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , like <unk> .
Do you pay the world ?
Let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to be <unk> ?
Or do you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to pay a lot of money ?
I think it &apos;s like that , right ?
It &apos;s <unk> .
It <unk> down on money , Chemikalien and <unk> , and they don &apos;t have to be a good good thing .
Now , let &apos;s see it at the <unk> .
This is the same thing that people say in two Milliarden Jahren .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> than <unk> , <unk> those <unk> , <unk> that are not able to be able to come up with a <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> , but people are known to be <unk> .
And when I &apos;m really very careful , I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to go .
Now , I think it &apos;s okay , I think , as a good thing , I think that the next good thing is , you know .
Thank you .
I grew up with a <unk> of a <unk> of Science Fiction .
At the end of the day , I went to the Bus in New York , I went to the Bus to go .
And what I would do was like a Buch of a Buch , a Science Project , in my mind , in <unk> , in other Welten , and that , in <unk> , in <unk> .
And , in fact , this , that &apos;s because of these things , I think that I was going to be in the fact that I &apos;m not in the room , I &apos;m in the Wald , and in the Wald , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , I think it &apos;s real <unk> .
Now , all the time I did was really true of the world , the West <unk> .
Also , meine Liebe zur Wissenschaft war also <unk> , in der Welt , in der Welt , um mich herum <unk> , denn was passierte , war das Ende der <unk> , wir gingen zum Mond , wir gingen zum Mond , wir waren also in den <unk> , Jacques <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> und <unk> .
It turns out that it turns on to the whole Science Fiction .
And I guess what .
I konnte malen .
And you know , because he was not <unk> <unk> , and all the <unk> of <unk> Filme , all these things in the <unk> , I went to the <unk> .
You know , that would be , that all of us are going to talk to us as a book , and it was a Buch in the <unk> of the <unk> .
I mean , my answer is , again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , both the same thing .
I am stuck with <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
That war the Kreativität that was a <unk> .
And he thought that it was a very interesting thing , the Jacques <unk> in my mind , <unk> me very fascinated by the fact that it &apos;s a <unk> thing .
Now , I &apos;m going to be able to actually be able to actually be able to go into a <unk> world .
It &apos;s quite unwahrscheinlich .
Now , what I &apos;m looking at is what I &apos;m going to go out on Earth , which was so reich in the same room , which was so reich and <unk> , as anything I thought of the <unk> .
So I decided to go back in 15 years .
I mean the only thing that I was born in a small Dorf in Canada , about 600 degrees of 600 Meilen .
Now , let me go down .
I &apos;m going to go back to the Vater of a Vater , until there was a <unk> in New York City , New York , which is where I lived .
And I went to a piece of <unk> , in a <unk> of a <unk> , in the Winter , in West , in <unk> , New York .
And I started to see the Ozean , a real Ozean , not only two years later , when I went to California .
Seitdem , in the <unk> of 40 years , I spent about 3,000 hours of water , and I spent 500 hours of water .
And so I &apos;ve looked at the time that the <unk> environment , and all the <unk> Ozean , so reich is that it &apos;s extremely <unk> .
Now , the personal thing of the person is so <unk> , but with a <unk> , people are <unk> .
Now , I came up with the one thing that I was looking at the time I was in the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> Liebe in the Ozean .
But when I accept as a child to be a while .
And that &apos;s what the best way to do was that I tell you a lot of thing that I wanted to talk to my Verlangen back to the day .
And as kind of , as a child , I was getting on the <unk> .
Show what the way to do here , the way that these things do , these things do things .
And those who were <unk> that I asked to wonder , &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I mean , &quot; The <unk> &quot; , I gave up a little bit of a little bit of oil and <unk> , again , again .
You know , people are <unk> .
A interesting thing is called &quot; The <unk> &quot; , &quot; The <unk> &quot; , &quot; that , &quot; that you see on the first <unk> in the morning , the <unk> of the line of <unk> , which is a <unk> of <unk> .
And it turned into the following &quot; soft <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , which are at the first time .
And so , despite the first time , I don &apos;t know what the first thing was I &apos;m not looking at a little bit of <unk> , which was what I thought was what I was doing in a little bit of a big deal .
Now , you know , it &apos;s Arthur <unk> Gesetz , which is , that &apos;s not a <unk> technology .
You see what it is .
And that &apos;s what I found .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , this is a story that <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
So , in &quot; <unk> two &quot; , was my first video , which I was talking about .
<unk> with <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;re called the <unk> <unk> in the film . The heart was trying to work .
And that &apos;s what it did .
And we also do the same thing .
All of the time we do is a little bit of money .
And so , again , one of those two strands of things that go to the two Punkten of women , führte it into a whole world .
And so I started to go back to a little bit of <unk> <unk> , my good Freund of <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> and <unk> in time and <unk> .
And the thing that the first thing was that we were looking at a watch , which was a <unk> Prozessen of optical <unk> and the same thing and we can actually go to digital <unk> .
And so that we are actually looking at the time .
Now , in fact , we were looking at this in <unk> , in the United States , in <unk> , in the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> .
And so what I call the <unk> : &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is what says that the whole thing was that the whole city of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And I &apos;ve heard of the people in my own day in my own day .
And so I went to the Kühlschrank and I went to see the other Film <unk> that <unk> .
I &apos;ll do it in the room , like , &quot; <unk> and <unk> <unk> . &quot;
This is a <unk> romantic , <unk> .
What I &apos;m looking for was what I wanted to go to the real <unk> of the &quot; Titanic &quot; <unk> .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m called .
I mean , that &apos;s the fact . You know , that &apos;s what it did .
Now , let me go down . I said , &quot; I &apos;ll go back to the <unk> . &quot;
Now , in the beginning of the morning , they do the <unk> .
It &apos;ll be very wichtiges . This is a fantastic <unk> .
I mean , one of them is a Expedition .
<unk> .
Now , because of course , a whole thing that I went back to three decades later , I discovered that we were looking at a study in a study , two and a half and a half and a half and a half , in the middle of a <unk> .
So I stand up .
And it <unk> so hard to work and work and <unk> and all sorts of things .
Now , most of all , I &apos;ve been able to do the whole thing that I &apos;ve been trying to do in <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s actually a very strong thing and the <unk> .
Now , in the front of the <unk> , you &apos;ve got to get out in the United States , where he wants to do in the dunklen <unk> environment , where he can &apos;t do this .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s what I &apos;m looking at in a Science Fiction .
This is cool .
And so what I mean , I &apos;ve got to <unk> the Geschmack of the street .
Now , all of the Neugierde , the <unk> thing .
It war everything . What &apos;s an amazing thing . What &apos;s a <unk> thing .
Because , you know , I can &apos;t see the same thing , and I &apos;ll see that we were looking at the same problem .
Now , as many of us at the time of the time I used to take a lot of people who used to be a little bit of <unk> , and manchmal things I haven &apos;t been able to do in some cases of the time , which would not be what I thought of , which were really allowed by the world that we see .
So what I did here is what I came down with .
And that &apos;s what I did .
I mean , I said , &quot; OK , I said , &quot; OK , I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m like , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to go back to school as Hollywood .
And so we also started the <unk> .
And he came up with the <unk> , and <unk> it <unk> .
We went to the <unk> of the Titanic .
We put these little <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
And the reason you do to go back to back in the back and a half of the time you haven &apos;t been doing before .
No one is what you do in the <unk> . They didn &apos;t care to work .
So here , I &apos;ve got here , in the <unk> of the Titanic , <unk> in a single U-Boot , and I came back to <unk> in <unk> , and I thought , in fact , I thought that the whole thing was happening .
And I went to a little bit of the time I came up with a little bit of time .
When I said , I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to see it in the floor of the car , I fühlte me to keep looking at the floor of the Titanic .
And what happened was the kind of <unk> kind of <unk> that I give you , I was looking at all the time , which would be what it would be , for the <unk> of the sky , which are actually <unk> , because I discovered on the front of the time .
I mean , as a tragic shot on the <unk> of the Schiff .
Now , what &apos;s a really serious issue .
And he felt that the <unk> issue , which was the <unk> problem , which will be the same thing that you see the same thing in the sky , in the other side , in the sky .
It really <unk> .
Now , a little bit of a couple of things that could go back to the same thing , was going to go back to this , as &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in some of those <unk> <unk> , in many cases , in many ways .
And so , the <unk> of the <unk> , and really guess what it is , was what it was like , in the middle of the <unk> , which we are looking at the <unk> of these very primitive .
And they are essentially <unk> creatures here .
They live in <unk> .
You know , they don &apos;t live in a <unk> .
And so the other thing that happened is to be a child in 500 <unk> <unk> .
You know , they think it &apos;s possible .
So what happened to the same thing I was looking for a lot of time to go back to <unk> , just like a child .
And I came across to the <unk> , just to deal with NASA , <unk> to the NASA , real time to the NASA <unk> , I went to Russland , I went to Russland , I went to Russland , I went to the <unk> <unk> .
I mean .
Now , was the most exciting thing that I see in the middle of the time I was looking at .
And they also pick up , so they <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in the extreme <unk> , people who were interested in the extreme <unk> , they &apos;ll go to the <unk> and <unk> .
So here we are , what we were looking at is the first time , actually , actually , really , really , was a real time .
I mean , I went to the <unk> of the Science Fiction , ever known as a child .
Now , in fact , I &apos;ve got to talk about the <unk> of women .
I had a lot of <unk> . Now , I had a lot of the <unk> .
Now , this is what you &apos;re looking at is a <unk> , unfortunately , <unk> , <unk> , the same thing .
I didn &apos;t really know about the <unk> of the <unk> .
I mean , I said , &quot; What do I mean , &quot; What do I mean here ?
What do I do ? What do I do ? &quot;
Now , we don &apos;t make money down .
It &apos;s rather <unk> . It &apos;s not <unk> .
Now , people think of all that I walked away from the &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; and I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; <unk> &quot; and I &apos;m going to add an incredible thing .
All right , I went all the Filmen , all these <unk> .
No <unk> , no matter , no matter , no money . Where are the work ?
You know , the thing for the work was , to the <unk> , and the Ozean is the most powerful environment that he &apos;s looking for the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , which are like a little bit of a little <unk> .
Because all of the things that we are looking at all the time that we were looking for .
You know , there &apos;s a little bit more about <unk> in the car .
And so , of course , the whole thing is , people ever know that the most powerful thing was that you know for them , and that says , &quot; I &apos;ll tell you that you &apos;re going to go on .
Now , when you go back to <unk> , and you say , &quot; I mean that we are going to go back and see the <unk> and the <unk> , and the one thing that all the technology and the <unk> , and the same thing that you see is going to be a <unk> .
This is a whole band , and a whole woman .
And so , when I came back to the first day , then the &quot; <unk> &quot; , I asked the &quot; <unk> &quot; , I asked the same thing , which is the same thing that you see in the <unk> , and that ever gets to <unk> .
And it just changed .
And so what I &apos;m looking at here is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a car , &quot; <unk> &quot; to be a little bit of the same thing that we were looking at .
<unk> .
<unk> .
And he will become a <unk> and a half and a half .
And it changed all the time that I was looking .
And so , people are told you , &quot; <unk> , &quot; but they said , &quot; The United States has come back to the Earth .
For me , for me , the same thing that the whole thing was doing was the way it changed .
Now , was , was , right ?
You know , was what are the <unk> philosophy ?
Well , I &apos;m a fan of Neugierde .
It &apos;s called the <unk> .
<unk> is the real thing that real real real time .
And the Respekt of your Team is wichtiger , when all the <unk> in the world .
And he &apos;s going to be junger English , and I said , &quot; Give me an hour .
And I said , &quot; Don &apos;t be <unk> .
Other people do it for ever to do it for you , never to be <unk> .
You know .
NASA <unk> the <unk> , which is , &quot; <unk> isn &apos;t a person . &quot;
<unk> has to be a phone in art and women , which is a <unk> in the middle .
And he didn &apos;t have the same thing that Innovation has paid no work .
You know , we &apos;re going to get to the <unk> .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about is what I &apos;m going to leave you in is , that &apos;s what you do , to be a decision .
Now , when I think that you know a very nice reason , if I think it &apos;s the whole thing of the world , which is the whole thing of the <unk> .
Instead of thinking about <unk> Information , I think I &apos;ll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get two things .
So here &apos;s a typical <unk> in the lab .
Now the capital I use here is a <unk> .
It &apos;s called <unk> . This is a <unk> , and I can put a <unk> into one another .
I can see now I can see a different hole .
This is where you see here in the middle of the West , and here &apos;s the <unk> .
And we can go back to <unk> and see the world &apos;s <unk> .
Now , we see that we can see that we are <unk> and look at the typical <unk> , but not for everyone .
Now , as a result , as well as we <unk> , in about three years , we think about 40 dollars , when we see , it &apos;s <unk> .
You know , when you fall back in <unk> , it means that it &apos;s more likely to be .
Now , this is what I &apos;m thinking about the same thing in the same way to go back into a <unk> .
Now , when you do this in <unk> , why don &apos;t you do ?
Now , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got here is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that you &apos;re looking at .
Everything is here . That &apos;s all right .
You can go back to the sky .
You know , this is a decade ago .
You can get a <unk> .
You can go to a <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to draw this . I see the <unk> in the number of time in the number of time .
And I &apos;m called <unk> Armstrong , also , so I came up with a <unk> , and that gave me a lot of <unk> , and that gave me all sorts of <unk> .
Now , when I &apos;m going to come back here , I &apos;m thinking , &quot; What are we going to be like , &quot; Warum nicht all the <unk> ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to go back and go back .
Now , I &apos;ll see Greg <unk> .
You can see that when you do this in the same way of Information , and smaller and <unk> , and you can &apos;t do it , you know , don &apos;t want to be .
It &apos;s a different thing .
It &apos;s <unk> , and I think it &apos;s true , and we think that it &apos;s true , you can do it .
So I &apos;m going to do it with a little bit of a <unk> .
Here we are now in the Wikipedia of Wikipedia , and they become a little <unk> .
Now , you know , you know , this is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> .
Now here I &apos;ll see here today &apos;s 500 <unk> .
Now , in fact , in these cases , we can do it .
Now , now , I &apos;ve got to think of the reason that people are <unk> in Wikipedia .
And I &apos;ve got to get married .
Now , I mean , that &apos;s what I &apos;m looking for , I see , I &apos;ll see the <unk> , which is what I &apos;m looking at is the <unk> of Time .
This is really , very wichtiges , because the argument in no one of the <unk> <unk> .
You can do it only one day and you can do it .
Now , when I came back to one of the time I thought I &apos;d go back to the <unk> Time of Time , I &apos;ll go back to the <unk> .
Now , one thing all the people would tell me that the most of the people are <unk> .
Some of those who are <unk> .
A little bit of a little bit of different from the <unk> .
Here &apos;s my Chef .
<unk> , <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is , is that Bono is a TED <unk> .
So we can jump to all the TED <unk> .
So we also <unk> by the Web to think about the Web , which is actually a Web , not of the students in a <unk> .
I &apos;ll give you a different one of the other hand that I &apos;m going to tell you .
I &apos;ll see here in the city of New York Times .
<unk> , the same thing -- I &apos;ll say that -- I &apos;ll be able to see it in a <unk> , it will be actually <unk> , but you can see that it &apos;s really <unk> , but you can see the <unk> technology .
I &apos;ll go back to a day and I go to a <unk> .
Well , what this is very interesting is , I &apos;ll tell you so many of the things that I &apos;m looking at the same time I was thinking of the same thing .
And I can see that in many cases , I used to take a while .
Here is the only one of the things that I &apos;m looking at .
And I can &apos;t do some of those things I &apos;ve been able to do .
Now , when I do a voice , I &apos;ll do everything , and I &apos;ll be able to do my <unk> <unk> .
And here &apos;s what I was looking at the time that I came up with was a <unk> , and I came up with <unk> Labs .
Now , of course , I &apos;m going to go back to the students and I &apos;ll go back .
And that is a nice thing that you do with a little bit of the same thing , and you can do it all the time you can do it .
Now , in fact , in our world , we see ?
Now , it &apos;s about the <unk> of <unk> Information .
Now , it &apos;s about <unk> in the world .
Now , when we do that now , I think it &apos;s going to be a piece of work , and the Web to go back to the back of the day , so far from one thing to go back to the one thing that we see in many of these things are going to be able to be able to <unk> , and the Muster will be <unk> .
Now , when we do this , it &apos;s not a very different thing in the world , if it &apos;s really possible .
Anstatt a whole whole thing to work together , it may be <unk> .
Now , when you do Wissen , it &apos;s really true .
So that &apos;s what I worry about .
Now , people are <unk> .
Now , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to see some of the things that are <unk> five studies with &quot; Glück , &quot; in &quot; <unk> , &quot; in the <unk> , and there &apos;s been a half , and he went to about 40 .
It &apos;s really fun to Glück , <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> .
You know , people are getting better .
Now , trotz all of all , he &apos;s going to be different with different players that it &apos;s very easy to think about <unk> .
And I &apos;ll actually tell you about the <unk> <unk> .
This is going to be a better people who talk about their own good news , and it would be used to think of people who think about Glück , but that &apos;s how it seems to be true .
Now , the first one is the <unk> of Komplexität .
And it seems to say that it &apos;s a good thing to be able to be very simple .
And I think that he would be a different of the same thing that it would be like , but all this is what it would be like , but it &apos;s like that one thing that I want to do is <unk> , and I want to be able to be able to be a very nice picture of <unk> .
And the first thing you see is the <unk> between the talk and Speicher , which is , I &apos;m going to tell you a lot of other things in your day and talk about every day .
And these are two different things that are in many cases , in some cases , <unk> .
And the third of the third of the day and the unglücklichen one was that we don &apos;t think about a condition that would not be a condition that would be <unk> on our <unk> .
I mean , this is really a <unk> .
It &apos;s not a whole thing to do this .
Now , I &apos;m going to start looking at the same time that you go to a <unk> and a half ago and a half of a story .
I mean .
And it said that there &apos;s been an amazing thing that I &apos;m going to tell you , and that &apos;s what the real amazing thing was and am Ende the beginning of the shot .
And then , really , really , really , really , really <unk> , that all the whole issue .
Now , it wasn &apos;t .
It &apos;s going to <unk> the ideas .
There &apos;s no issue .
There was a lot of two words .
They were not supposed to be a little bit about it , because there &apos;s been <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , in fact , people are like two people .
It &apos;s a <unk> I &apos;m sitting in there in the fact that you see in the fact that there &apos;s a little bit of the prison in there .
You know , you know , I said , &quot; Do you know , I know , when you say , &quot; Do you know , when the Arzt says , &quot; Do you know when I do here ?
I mean , that &apos;s what I &apos;m looking at , and the <unk> I &apos;m looking at the time that was <unk> , and the story of your day , and that &apos;s the fact that the <unk> would be <unk> , and that &apos;s what you want to be like , &quot; What are you going to know ? &quot;
You know , &quot; What &apos;s the thing in <unk> &quot; about .
And these are two different things , and I &apos;ll go to the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> of both one of them in two to two .
I mean , I &apos;m looking .
And that &apos;s actually a real impact of our ideas -- it beginnt sofort .
Now , not a lot of people who tell us , I &apos;ll tell you .
Now , in fact , people tell me , I &apos;ll tell you , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show unseres Erfahrungen .
And let me go back .
This is a <unk> .
These are real people who are <unk> .
I &apos;ll actually do the details . This is not schmerzhaft , but it war schmerzhaft when the first time I went back to the United States .
And they wanted to take a 60 and a half minutes .
And these are two people .
This is <unk> .
And he said , &quot; What are we going to do , &quot; How do you know ? &quot;
And this is a very simple answer .
This is exactly the <unk> B .
<unk> <unk> has a long time , and for every one of the time you have a minute and a half of a half , B has to come back .
Now here &apos;s another question : How do you know that people are missing ?
And that &apos;s what matters is , that &apos;s what happens is that Patient is going to give a much more <unk> .
Now , the stories of the <unk> <unk> , which is a very , very close to the story -- and not all of those Geschichten is very inspirierend by <unk> -- but one of those who is a story .
And the most exciting thing is that the one thing is trying to do the <unk> .
This is a <unk> .
What are we all known to know that people are going to talk to their <unk> , and more and more later , &quot; What &apos;s the whole condition of all the time ? &quot;
I mean , most of all , for A to the B , in the new direction .
Now , this is a <unk> Konflikt zwischen the <unk> and the <unk> .
Of course , I &apos;ve got a different side of the <unk> I &apos;ve got to do B .
Now , you can go to the <unk> A , and now we actually do clinical research and that &apos;s happening , and that &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s going to be the <unk> of cancer , and he can &apos;t do the <unk> of the sky .
And so that people are suffering of suffering , but not very much , and less than .
Und wenn Sie das mal ein paar Minuten <unk> haben , möchte ich Ihnen von diesem <unk> A <unk> , und Sie haben es für einen <unk> gemacht .
What are the story ?
I mean , that &apos;s where the stories are going to do to the Speicher , and it &apos;s because of the <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s a story of the world , <unk> moments and <unk> .
<unk> are very , very close , very close to the best .
Now , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> every day .
It &apos;s moments of moments , one of the other .
And he asked , &quot; What &apos;s the <unk> ?
And the answer is really simple .
They are being lost .
I &apos;m going to tell you , these are kind of <unk> in our lives -- I &apos;ve got to come up with it .
This is , you know , in a place , it &apos;s about 600 million .
In fact , it &apos;s about 600.000 .
Now , these are not <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s a whole lot of whole thing that I wanted to do with it .
And you know , one of the other reasons that they are about to be <unk> , that &apos;s where , that &apos;s where I was looking at the time .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which are <unk> .
And you think it &apos;s relevant to be relevant in , but that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to do .
Now , I mean , that &apos;s what I &apos;m looking at , and I was really different and I &apos;m completely different .
You know , the Big Unterschied among both the time .
Of course , I &apos;m going to give you a Urlaub , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to give you a Urlaub .
So this is not what I &apos;m going to do .
Now , for example , I &apos;m not going to be a <unk> of two little little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a Woche , because he &apos;s not going to be a few words .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
And so that &apos;s what it really seemed to do was the critical humility I do in a <unk> .
Now this is a rather difficult thing .
You know , I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;ll tell you a few minutes .
This is the fact that the people will be like , when you do a cancer , you know , you know , you know , two <unk> , two <unk> <unk> , and then you can &apos;t have to be a <unk> of two different and a <unk> , which is going to be <unk> .
I mean , that <unk> , I don &apos;t have in the case .
We don &apos;t get a lot of values .
We are looking for a lot of ideas . <unk> , <unk> , as well as people think of the people think of their hands .
We think about their hands as a <unk> .
And you can see this as the first thing that I want to do is , and you know , I &apos;ll see the first thing that I was looking at the same thing that I was looking at the same thing that I wanted to do with a lot of values that I wanted to actually pay to spend a little bit of time .
And that &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> .
I &apos;m thinking , &quot; What are we going to do with women ?
This is one of the ways that you get to the <unk> of the <unk> .
I mean , when I think I &apos;ve been trying to spend on a Urlaub at the first time in the hospital that I think that most people are going to look at me .
Now , I discovered my ideas of three hours to spend about 25 hours of about 25 years .
Now , when I come to you in the 600 Bildern of the 600 Bildern of the 600 , I &apos;ll be able to get back .
This is three words and this is fast a half .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
Now , what I &apos;m looking at is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of cancer , but even though , as well , as well , that &apos;s more likely to see what it &apos;s like , which are the most powerful thing in terms of minds that are in terms of passion , that are the same thing that people are like this ?
So I &apos;m going to think about a <unk> .
Now , this is what ever happened at the next time , that &apos;s going to be <unk> all the <unk> of all the time .
What happens is , let &apos;s pick up a <unk> ?
And you know , I &apos;ve got to talk about it .
This is not what you think of when you think of a matter of times an opportunity .
When you think of the brain , you might want to be a different answer .
Now , what we &apos;re looking for is that people who are among the <unk> of the two <unk> .
Now , the two <unk> people suffer to two <unk> of <unk> .
And he &apos;s really going to be a lot of good news that we do .
So you can do things ?
And what do you want to talk to is , you know , you know , you know ?
All right -- it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
What are the <unk> ?
Now , in fact , I think it &apos;s a pretty good thing that I wanted to do to be a pretty good thing of doing it .
When you want to talk to you , I think it &apos;s a whole different thing .
This is not what you &apos;re going to be <unk> .
And that &apos;s what you want to talk about is , you know , people are thinking about your day .
<unk> different .
Now , all of the reasons that the reason I think of a lot of time is going to go to a lot of thinking about the <unk> of the day , and I was looking at a study of research , and I went to a study of research on the <unk> of the day .
You know , the other thing that I &apos;m talking about is that you know , I &apos;m going to talk to you , and I &apos;m going to tell you that I was looking at most of the <unk> , and he &apos;s going to be able to do the two <unk> , which was going to be a global economy , which is a global economy , which was a global set of people who think about their lives .
And he &apos;s going to go back .
Now , in fact , most of us are working on the <unk> of the two <unk> .
And most of the most people who are , I think it &apos;s really different .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
Just to tell you the answer to the <unk> , the right thing is about <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s what happens to anyone and you can tell us , that &apos;s a third of which is going to be a Meter 80 , which is what you know about it ?
You know , it should be a little bit of your <unk> .
So we &apos;ve got to tell you , when I tell you , I &apos;ll tell you that somebody &apos;s going to be a number of eight times a number of 10 , ever has a lot of people who are talking about our <unk> .
It is also schwach .
Now , I know one thing was that I &apos;m going to vote on the <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , it &apos;s very , very wichtiges , <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s what it seems to be a lot of good thing that we are talking about people who are people who are <unk> .
It &apos;s other <unk> , but it wiegt .
Now , as soon as you know , the good thing to do is the next two to the two things .
I mean , that &apos;s what I &apos;m looking at here is that we &apos;re going to be very happy to see as a <unk> .
It &apos;s a total different .
And now , very quickly -- other words , I don &apos;t think about <unk> Glück , so that we don &apos;t think about the same thing as I was thinking about the same thing .
Now , when you do that simple , you know , you know , people are not going to be able to get the answer .
Now , when you do that , people are getting glücklicher in Kalifornien than your <unk> in Kalifornien .
I think that was when you think about Kalifornien in Kalifornien , people who are <unk> in Kalifornien and other things , and the soul will be like .
And it seems to be true that the Klima sounds not so wichtig that I was looking for , and I was not looking for the thinking of what people are .
You know , you know , I &apos;m going to <unk> the Chef of the Chef , which is what you see in Kalifornien .
And it &apos;s really interesting to go back to the people who have been able to become more glücklicher and more glücklicher .
Now , that &apos;s not going to be a better <unk> .
I mean .
But one thing he would do is , it &apos;s going to be glücklicher . And that &apos;s what people are going to be more glücklicher , but when you think about it , it &apos;s kind of a <unk> thing .
And they think that they are the answer to the answer .
It &apos;s really a very long thing to think about trust , and I hoffe , I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;ll tell you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you .
When we looked at some of the other words that we tell me that he came up with a very interesting view of the <unk> .
Can &apos;t you do this at the same time that you &apos;ve got a few minutes ?
Daniel <unk> : I &apos;m sure that the most interesting thing about the <unk> is that I think it &apos;s really interesting .
It doesn &apos;t matter to the <unk> .
When people are <unk> about the heart of the Einkommens .
Now , that is , in the <unk> of 60,000 $ $ , for people to see , for people , and when you go to a whole bunch of people , it &apos;s like a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> of the 600.000 $ .
CA : 60,000 <unk> : 60,000 60,000 dollars per year , when people are unglücklich , and they &apos;re <unk> by the poor .
Now , this is a total <unk> .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve seen a little bit of the <unk> line .
And it &apos;s true , which is that you don &apos;t want to buy a lot of <unk> , but that would be a Mangel an <unk> , but that would be a Mangel an <unk> , really <unk> .
The other thing I do , I &apos;ll do it .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
This is not the <unk> .
CA : Danny , <unk> , the whole United States is <unk> , Freiheit and <unk> .
When people do the results are still doing it all the time I think it &apos;s all wrong , was like , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , and so forth .
Do you think of the people who do the country , which would be the country &apos;s country and the öffentlichen <unk> ?
<unk> : Do you know , I think that he &apos;s suffering in the öffentlichen world .
And the emotions are going to go back to the United States , which creates a difference in the United States , which is actually a difference , but in the United States .
People know that people are thinking about how to think about the highest rule .
And it wanted to be more and more and more likely to talk about the <unk> of the world that are working on the <unk> of the day and so I think it &apos;s going to work .
Now , as long as it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s kind of different of how you think about it , and when I think of it , I think I was looking at the <unk> .
This is the <unk> thing in the day , I think .
In the United States , they &apos;ve been working on the United States .
I &apos;m going to tell you about 20 in the United States .
CA : Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;m looking at , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to go to the past , in the two few years .
Now , thanks to the story of the head of the head .
Thank you , Danny <unk> .
I &apos;ve heard about Energie and Klima .
And it seems to be a little bit significant , which is what I &apos;m talking about is a little bit of a thousand , which will be about two to two thousand people and Samen with the same thing that are the ärmsten two Milliarden Menschen .
You know , it &apos;s broken and Klima invisible to the people in love , rather than all the time .
And the whole thing that it works is they can grow up with their <unk> .
And he can do to be a little bit of Regen .
Things want to be able to be able to make up the <unk> quality of your <unk> .
And it seemed to prevent Hunger . It führt to the <unk> .
That would be the Klimawandel .
You know , the Preis of Energie is invisible .
In fact , when you can &apos;t do this one thing that you can &apos;t do this , you know , you can &apos;t do your disease .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
Really , modern Europe basiert on the same in your family .
And the <unk> <unk> to the industriellen Revolution , and in the 20. Jahrhundert , he would actually go back to the World War of electricity , and so now we are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , right ?
And so this is a beautiful condition of electricity in the <unk> world .
Now , now , now , it used to be a <unk> -- and now , that you can do two and it &apos;s going to be like a half a little bit , and it &apos;s like CO2 .
You see , CO2 <unk> to the Earth , and the status of CO2 is actually very simple .
Now , when you do this , your CO2 is <unk> , which is a <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
And the Effekt of those and , if you do , well , you have a little bit of free , the <unk> Effekte , which is the same cases that the natürlicher weapons are being able to do this very soon .
Now , the one thing that you do is , you know , you know , you know , you can see a number of CO2 in your body , and where the positive problem is , it &apos;s a whole lot of positive , but it &apos;s not very much .
And he &apos;s really sure you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
I used to go to <unk> .
Now , are really going to be a <unk> ?
Are we not going to do the end of a <unk> ?
And the answer is that , I mean , it &apos;s like , because , it wants to get away from Null .
And that &apos;s what this is .
It ’ s kind of a different thing to be able to do a four feet now , and then you wanted to go back to a church of <unk> feet .
This is a good thing .
Now , now , now , we &apos;ve got to grow up with a lot of CO2 , but now 26 percent .
For every Amerikaner , it &apos;s about 20 Tonnen .
For the people in poor countries , it &apos;s less like one .
This is a population of a number of <unk> for everyone on Earth .
And so , I mean , you know , the same thing that you do , was able to do it .
It &apos;s <unk> .
I mean , that &apos;s the same thing that you see was the same thing , also , now , that was a whole hour of a <unk> , so far and a <unk> .
This is four values .
<unk> .
Now , one thing that you have to do is , you know , CO2 , that you &apos;ve got to put up in your hand , and that &apos;s made more of those people , and so on the number of people , the average price of disease , a <unk> of money , the CO2 to pay for a <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s the same thing that we see here is , and now , if you can do this in Null .
Now , one of those are not one of those who are in the middle of one hand .
Now , that &apos;s not what it &apos;s called in the New York .
Let &apos;s think about the people .
Now , that &apos;s what happened to the Tages <unk> Milliarden Menschen .
This is another one thing to be about nine Milliarden .
Now , as well , as well as we actually do a lot of car , health , health , <unk> Gesundheitssystem , if we can &apos;t do it now , maybe 10 of 15 percent , but here &apos;s 10 15 percent .
Now , the first one is that we use .
This is all the time that we eat , that <unk> , that we eat , Kleidung , <unk> .
This is a very good thing , and the <unk> of Armut , <unk> <unk> , will be the <unk> of all .
So that &apos;s great than this .
Now , in the <unk> world , now , now , is one of the first number of cancer , now , now , now , in fact , is <unk> and <unk> , but now , in fact , the number of <unk> , we &apos;ve got to grow up the number , and so on .
Here we are .
You know , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s going to be able to read the future , which is , these are , that will be , these are not going to be able to go back .
Now , Effizienz , E , E , for every time .
Finally , well .
Now , this is not .
Hundreds of different things and different kinds of <unk> , <unk> of the other species of energy , different ways .
And he &apos;s a lot of money , which has to be completely <unk> .
Some of those <unk> , even 90 percent .
And he &apos;s different , and so , as if you do <unk> , if you do <unk> , I think it &apos;s more smaller than <unk> .
And so , as well , if we are optimistic , I think it &apos;s a Faktor of three to a <unk> .
But for the one thing that comes from the one is 26 percent , people are <unk> , 13 Milliarden , and that is just not enough .
Now , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to go back to the vierten Faktor -- this is a <unk> -- and that is the CO2 <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s what you can do in Null ?
You know , when you go back to Kohle .
If you do Erdgas .
And so many of the time you &apos;ve been able to actually do the one thing that we have to actually do electricity , except the <unk> teeth and Atomenergie .
And that &apos;s what it works to global Stand is a world .
Now , <unk> .
So , as I consider the word , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s unmöglich .
It &apos;s a Wunder .
The Internet and <unk> are a Wunder .
Now , the people here are taking a lot of sad .
Now , we don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> , as well as you may be a few breath .
They &apos;re going to get rid of it , and manchmal is it , well , sometimes .
This is one thing that we actually do with full time and work in full <unk> .
Now , I mean , you know , you know ?
Is it the same thing of the same paradigm , a <unk> that people are <unk> to people ?
I thought I came back to a little bit of looking at me , when I do some of these kinds of things I thought about the other words .
And it turned to the notion that people are <unk> people who are <unk> people .
You know , it &apos;s like the one thing that I thought was this one thing .
I decided that I was going to go back to the balance that I &apos;m looking at this .
So here are the same thing .
Now , let &apos;s tell you , dass sie nicht <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re not going to get out of those <unk> .
And so , he &apos;s going to be able to do all these <unk> Lösungen , so they can actually do something .
Thank you .
All right , I &apos;m going to get rid of it , <unk> of Energie , <unk> , <unk> .
Now , that may be a little bit more like that , and when you think of it as well , I think it &apos;s like that , that &apos;s what I mean , that &apos;s what I think of all of these are going to go back to each other .
Let &apos;s just like to come to fossilen Brennstoffen , whether it &apos;s <unk> <unk> of Erdgas .
You know , this is pretty simple .
You know , you can do all the CO2 in the <unk> , and you can put it down on the <unk> , with <unk> , and all you want it .
Now , here &apos;s a number of <unk> that this one thing is going to be 60 to 80 to 80 percent , but 100 percent are going to be very close to 100 percent , which would be very close to the CO2 , but that most of those are <unk> .
Now , how do you know ?
How do you want to look at the same thing as well as a result , which is going to be successful in the same way , the same thing in terms of other things ?
This is a huge deal .
This is a <unk> .
The first one is <unk> .
Now , here are three major issues here .
You know , the cost is , in <unk> <unk> countries .
Now the answer of the security , really wrong that would be wrong that would be wrong , that , because , all of us , all these people are <unk> , which will be <unk> .
Did you do the <unk> ?
And , of course , it wasn &apos;t very much so much .
You know , people don &apos;t know .
So one of these three things are going to be able to be <unk> , which will be <unk> .
In fact , these are three of those five , <unk> .
This is the same thing that people are <unk> .
I mean , as it &apos;s cool , that &apos;s what it doesn &apos;t have to be a <unk> .
And one thing is that it won &apos;t do this in the state of the environment of the world &apos;s disease .
This is <unk> , when you do this , you know , you know , you know , you know , much more than you wanted to do a normal increase .
All these are <unk> .
Now , the building was not going to do the whole thing , and it &apos;s not every Tages , and , really , <unk> it .
And so , as if you are your own , it will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> .
This is what we &apos;re looking at .
We are <unk> .
Let &apos;s think that the bridge is different from your own country , right ?
And , I think it &apos;s a <unk> .
And it &apos;s like the picture of the same thing I used to see in the form of <unk> , for cars , for <unk> , for <unk> , for <unk> , for <unk> , for <unk> , for all , and on the same one , which is the <unk> of the world .
Now , here are now a Big <unk> .
It &apos;s not easy , but it &apos;s not easy .
This is , very close to the <unk> version of the <unk> , 20 to 30 percent of the time you do .
When you go back to 100 percent , then you pay a <unk> .
Now , how are we going to be successful . What is the richtigen Ansatz ?
Is it <unk> ? What are we going to do this ?
Now , all of these are women who are trying to work in .
In each one of those are all these are <unk> .
And so , very often , I know that is okay .
And I think that here in the <unk> , people are <unk> .
Bill <unk> has different cities , including a call called <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in about three women in about three times the great things and interesting .
Nathan <unk> , and I reward you a little bit of the same thing , which is , perhaps , <unk> .
It &apos;s a number of <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And it &apos;s all very long because it &apos;s not very difficult in the process , so it &apos;s not so seltsam that he &apos;s good .
Now the answer of <unk> is that , if you do a little bit of a little bit of a little <unk> ; one percent , which is a percent , which is called the 99 percent , <unk> .
A little bit of a little bit of feeling .
Now , you know , people are supposed to be a little bit of thinking , but they can &apos;t work very well .
Now , in fact , this group of <unk> can do this .
You know , this is what happened to the richtigen brain .
And you can actually do 99 percent of the 99 .
You can actually do the <unk> , and as a <unk> , you know the <unk> <unk> of the United States .
So that &apos;s what you want to do is the first one , which is beautiful .
This is actually the <unk> . It turns out .
You can see in the course of the course , well , I think it &apos;s called <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s actually a real solution .
I &apos;m here at Kentucky here in Kentucky .
This is <unk> , the 99 percent , which is the 99 percent .
This is called <unk> .
This is more important to the United States .
And so , in a billigen way , a billigen and a glass <unk> , which is going to be <unk> down .
And so , he &apos;s more interested in the morning , but it &apos;s a little bit of an example of those of those three and some of those three and three of women who are working .
Now , how are we thinking about it ?
Now , how are we going to tell you ?
Let &apos;s just show you where we are like , and then in <unk> .
After 2050 , many people are about 80 percent .
And it &apos;s really wichtig .
And that &apos;s 20 percent of the time of poor countries in the poor countries .
I mean , we would have a <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s what 80 percent of the 80 percent of the country also are growing up to the United States , including China .
And the other thing that others do is , I mean , <unk> Technologien in all nations in all the country , and are the time that anyone who lived on all .
It &apos;s great .
This is a very wichtiges <unk> .
What are you going to do for 2020 ?
Now , you know , it will be a <unk> .
Now , in fact , we are working with the teeth .
Now , as far as you can <unk> , you can &apos;t do the CO2 of CO2 , and so you can &apos;t do it .
Now , in some cases , the one thing that we do , was a little bit of the same thing that would not be in the <unk> <unk> , but perhaps , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe , maybe a different one is , it &apos;s the whole thing .
And these are the ones that are <unk> with full of time , and we can see this in terms of women , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> things that are changed .
Here &apos;s a big number of beautiful books .
This Buch of Al Gore , &quot; America <unk> &quot; and the Buch of David <unk> Buch , &quot; <unk> energy , no <unk> . &quot;
And they &apos;ll do it really well , and imagine a <unk> that this is where this is going to work in massive <unk> .
And he &apos;s very often .
This is a Wunsch .
It &apos;s a very different way of thinking about this technology .
Now , when you go back to the next 50 years , I &apos;ll give you an example of the next 50 years , and I could say , if Präsident was going to be a Impfstoff , I could be a Impfstoff , which is what I mean , if you do a little bit of CO2 , no CO2 , which is what I mean .
This is the thing that you see is the biggest thing .
Now , when you do this , it &apos;s not going to be a number of people who think about the people who are thinking about a long time and a long thing , which is a <unk> , between the United States and China , and most of poor and <unk> , and most of the people who do two Milliarden .
What are we going to do ?
What do I want to grow ?
We &apos;ve got to work for a million dollars .
Now , as a <unk> as Copenhagen as Copenhagen as Copenhagen , they don &apos;t know about CO2 .
You know , they are talking about the <unk> , and I &apos;ll actually see some of the <unk> in the <unk> .
Now , we have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , building and <unk> , but one that you can do .
We also do the following .
You know , you have to go back to the <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> .
This is a very wichtiges Wunsch , but I think we can go .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Danke .
Thank you . Now , I mean , I &apos;ve got to talk about <unk> , okay , right ?
Bill Gates : I mean , just to go up to the computer , buy all the <unk> , all the Big Bang , was that we know , this is a number of number three times , and now we actually test a little bit of thousands of times , and all of those neurons are going to work down .
And it &apos;s a heart of <unk> , which will be <unk> , which was a number of Milliarden , which was a <unk> , which is the one which was looking at the first time .
When you actually see the one thing is called , as a result , as well as a <unk> , it &apos;s just wrong , which is just true , which is the <unk> , which is different , different from the world .
CA : Well , right ?
BG : Well , that &apos;s true . This is what you do . Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , really many people , you know , you know , really many people , and all of the <unk> things can be done , the thing that you can do to make things work .
Okay .
Now , as you can do a very serious plate that you do 60 in 60 years -- it &apos;s just like a <unk> -- it &apos;s just like a <unk> -- and it wasn &apos;t really .
And he &apos;s going to go back and <unk> 60 years .
CA : This is a <unk> , which is <unk> .
BG : Yeah . Now , what he would do is , you know , he &apos;s going to get rid of the <unk> , you can &apos;t get rid of the <unk> -- you can actually go back to the <unk> , and you can see it down .
And we also start to go back in the <unk> that you see , that &apos;s where you &apos;re in .
This is a <unk> .
And that was what happens in the <unk> of the <unk> , which is actually where you are in their lives , and ever <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
CA : Now , in the global conversation , right ?
BG : Well , well , we don &apos;t have to be a little bit of a little bit of a time , and it &apos;s all very interesting about all the time that you &apos;re <unk> with everything , so that people are <unk> , so that people are <unk> of Russland to Russland .
I &apos;ve got to talk about the <unk> of Energie , and I think about it in the <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m optimistic . You know , I know that promise was , and the <unk> was .
This is a <unk> thing .
It &apos;s a very exciting thing , but it &apos;s like a <unk> , and it &apos;s like a <unk> , and all of the time we go to a <unk> , that would give you a <unk> .
CA : So , do you know , in your mind , more and more likely than this ?
BG : Well , well , we are willing to think of those <unk> things that are very easy to think about very billig .
This is a sort of thing that &apos;s called the <unk> of the <unk> .
You know , <unk> , more than all , was more likely to do that , you know .
And he &apos;s going to be interested in about three times women , now , which means that we are going to be able to do a little bit of the work , which is going to be good for the <unk> , which will be <unk> .
And it &apos;s the best thing you can do . You can actually do the same thing .
Now , we are willing to do one .
CA : So , in terms of <unk> <unk> , this is what you know ?
BG : Well , if you do a <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s what it would be happening , without the <unk> , but the <unk> sounds of the <unk> .
You know , in the <unk> Sektor .
Now , we know that we don &apos;t know our work as well as these , but the <unk> people , which is a different one .
It &apos;s a little bit <unk> , which is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it , but perhaps , I think it &apos;s about it .
And he &apos;s different , but most of those <unk> has a million times a million times more money than a <unk> , and so , as if you go to the negative Effekte , and so , as if you go to the negative Effekte that CO2 , that CO2 , which are <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> .
CA : So do you want to do it ?
Do we begin to start with the <unk> of <unk> , to just <unk> the Temperatur of the world ?
BG : So , when you do in the situation , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , and it will be a <unk> .
I want to go back to this ? Man will be a <unk> .
And he &apos;s actually called the <unk> of the <unk> , which are <unk> , which are different ways that we do about 20 to 30 of 30 years and so on .
It &apos;s just a <unk> .
You can &apos;t do it .
Now , some people can &apos;t do it in a <unk> , because that &apos;s what you want to be a <unk> , which may be <unk> , you know , you know , you know , because you can &apos;t <unk> .
Now , I don &apos;t know what it seems to be a bit more like the sound of the Problems , but he &apos;s really worried about the <unk> of the time that you want to think of the Fall of a little bit more and more likely to think of it .
CA : <unk> <unk> : than one of those two words , what can you say , what can you know what it would be wrong ?
BG : Well , unfortunately , the <unk> of different papers .
It &apos;s very small to the world .
Do you know that it &apos;s the negative Rückmeldung that are <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> ?
It &apos;s very , very small , very small things that may be very likely to be a <unk> .
Now the best thing that we are here today is a whole thing .
You know , you can actually do it .
And you know , if you &apos;ve got to <unk> all of the <unk> issues , the reason you get out of the fire , I think that you can do it .
Now , in fact , it actually <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and he will be able to see people in the <unk> world , and he &apos;s going to see people in the <unk> world .
And that &apos;s what the surgeons are going to come back .
Now , my Traum is that , when you do it , you can see the wirtschaftlichen thing to go back to the <unk> , you know , <unk> , right , right ?
CA : And so what happens is , I mean , that &apos;s what happens in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which was true of all the <unk> of the <unk> , which is that it &apos;s more <unk> of all the <unk> , which was going to be <unk> of all the time .
This is a multinational <unk> of Ressourcen that pay for money to pay for a long time .
BG : Well , the real increase to the R &amp; amp ; I said , &quot; You know , the United States is going to pay 10 Milliarden times , right ?
It doesn &apos;t work in other things .
This is actually a very big deal in <unk> , and I &apos;ll tell you a lot of people who are different from the number of things , as well .
This is , I think , people do it .
By the way you can &apos;t do very close to the answer , and you can &apos;t do the <unk> <unk> .
Now , I think it &apos;s different things that are going to be able to do very far .
Now , as a result that we &apos;re starting to start with it , we can actually do the money great to do it .
I mean , I mean , I want to be able to get more and more like this one thing that are going to be able to get out of your heart disease .
It &apos;s two to the two .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is , right now , why do you know .
And there &apos;s kind of , I &apos;m going to tell you , rather than <unk> , <unk> , but it erkannte that that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , and also , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
And so he &apos;s got the first thing that I &apos;m talking about .
And it &apos;s verrückt to be a little bit of R in the United States .
CA : I mean , Bill , I mean , I mean , I &apos;ll tell you what I &apos;m talking about , I &apos;ll actually tell you , I really know that I want you to go .
BG : Thank you .
Now , the first thing that I discovered was a few decades ago , when I first started looking at the <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of the time that I &apos;m going to work on the wrong thing that I &apos;m talking about , but I &apos;m going to get out of the <unk> , and I found that I didn &apos;t work in the <unk> .
I &apos;ll email the answer .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
And I read this for a friend and I decided to laugh , because it &apos;s kind of kind of kind of kind of <unk> , but I went to &quot; <unk> &quot; to go back to &quot; <unk> &quot; and I said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; to go back to the emotional Schock .
All right , this is a little bit of cool .
I &apos;m thinking about this .
Now , in fact , that 80 , when I came back to about the 80 , when I started to go back to the era of a day and a picture of my day back home and a whole bunch of other people and the world .
I didn &apos;t want to say that I didn &apos;t go to the <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s what if you &apos;re looking at the point of view , if you are born in the world , I think that if you were looking at a time when anyone would be like me , I think it &apos;s a good thing to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> .
And I went to the first time to be in 2009 , and I thought about 2009 online .
This is the <unk> version of the Text .
You can &apos;t do it .
And I &apos;m sure most of the answer in &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; and <unk> . &quot;
It &apos;s not a lot of answer .
That &apos;s what people are talking about people than we call the answer .
People in the answer , and , as well , people are <unk> .
Unsere <unk> , of course , is , and , as people are thinking , and now , in other words .
Now , of course , a lot of alter birds , the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> thought that the <unk> of a <unk> so mächtig war , will be <unk> .
What &apos;s the real thing that are going to do well , that is a person who is <unk> .
Now , as long as it <unk> a lot more than the <unk> of a Person , a child , a child , I &apos;m going to get rid of the control .
Do we want to be able to train up to them ?
And some of the <unk> to me what I call my Arzt to become a child when I was a little bit of the <unk> .
It &apos;s called Dr. <unk> .
<unk> , which means that you can &apos;t be a <unk> thing to work on .
Dr. <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and what we need to do is actually <unk> the good condition of the day .
I &apos;m trying to break all of it in the day that I was looking at the <unk> of the <unk> .
And I went to a fast <unk> of <unk> with these <unk> tools of <unk> -- different <unk> -- and some of the <unk> -- that we go to the <unk> .
I keep the <unk> <unk> .
I kept looking at them , put them .
Now , as a <unk> kind of <unk> , I &apos;m talking about Dr. <unk> , <unk> , just <unk> .
An one of a sudden , there &apos;s in a farm -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and I said , &quot; Wow . Aimee . &quot;
When you go back to this line , I &apos;ll get out of 100 dollars . &quot;
Now , what happens is that this is a <unk> of Dr. <unk> . I said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to go to the <unk> of the day that I &apos;m not going to go to the <unk> of the day that I &apos;m looking at the <unk> of the day , but was really what I &apos;m looking for for a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , most of all , I &apos;m going to be in <unk> , in <unk> my mind , I &apos;ll tell you a starken and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> , which was a <unk> and a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
This is a Beispiel of view in <unk> , which can be a little bit <unk> .
Now , in fact , in fact , most of the <unk> members of the <unk> of the audience who are people who think about the whole thing that we think about it , was just going to be able to see .
Unsere Sprache is also the <unk> of the world , and it wasn &apos;t very different .
<unk> , aus <unk> , meine Beine , <unk> für <unk> , <unk> <unk> und <unk> , <unk> , <unk> und <unk> , dass Menschen , um ihre <unk> <unk> , so dass Menschen , um ihre <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , damit sie sich selbst <unk> können .
Also , also , was uns also zeigt , dass wir jetzt viele <unk> machen , was immer eine Sache war , was immer eine Sache war , dass alle etwas <unk> und etwas <unk> , was uns <unk> , und dass unsere Fähigkeit , unsere besten Eigenschaft zu lösen .
And it &apos;s more likely to be a <unk> thing that &apos;s interesting , I think , you know , I &apos;m going to talk about it all of the <unk> of <unk> , and I &apos;m going to know .
You know , that &apos;s what I didn &apos;t understand , and it fühlte to me , and it fühlte by telling me , and I wondered , warum .
Now , the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> the heart of <unk> , &quot; which is going to go back to a <unk> issue , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , no <unk> <unk> , and so I mean , that &apos;s not a <unk> , if I was doing a <unk> .
Now , in fact , it &apos;s changed . They are <unk> by working with a Herausforderung , which is now physisch .
I mean , that &apos;s what a good thing is .
<unk> is not a long time , but it just <unk> .
It &apos;s a story of unseres Lebens .
I &apos;ve got to see when I &apos;m a Schatten .
And again , I &apos;ve got a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it , but it &apos;s like me .
I &apos;m not going to see the most powerful thing that I &apos;m looking at .
It &apos;s <unk> and <unk> in the Lebens , and it &apos;s all going to be very , very , very , very , very different , but that &apos;s not going to be able to go to <unk> .
Now , his responsibility is not only going to <unk> to <unk> of <unk> , but it &apos;s going to work for <unk> .
Now we &apos;re looking at our kids that are not a child than we know , they can &apos;t do it .
It &apos;s a <unk> Unterschied and Unterscheidung among the secret that I &apos;m talking about a <unk> and the <unk> , which I &apos;m really interested in .
I mean , really , the only real cure that I was doing with the world , which was telling me the world that ever looked at me .
In unserer <unk> , indem wir unseren <unk> <unk> , indem sie die <unk> <unk> , ob sie ihre <unk> <unk> , oder sogar eine Prognose der <unk> Lebensqualität , sollten wir sicher sein , dass wir uns nicht den ersten Stein vorstellen .
Now , it may be a whole thing to see in the front of the same thing , and you can &apos;t do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
Now , of course , to be able to get out of the <unk> of a Person , which is not able to be able to see a different economy , which is going to be a different range of the same thing that it should be .
Now , in fact , we &apos;re looking at the time that we are <unk> .
So we are now working on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the most powerful thing is that he &apos;s going to be a Kooperation among the <unk> <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t seem to be able to <unk> the long moments of <unk> than one of those who may be known to be able to <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the reason that I &apos;ll give you a little bit of an example , that you can &apos;t really trust that you can &apos;t trust it , but he says , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; but it will be <unk> .
When you see , as well as it is , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and so often .
This year , when Charles Darwin wrote in Charles Darwin , and then I wrote about 150 years ago , and then I wrote in about 150 words .
<unk> übersetzt , it &apos;s not the <unk> of those <unk> , still the kind of intelligent , but the one of the people who are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
In fact , in some of Darwin &apos;s jobs , I think it &apos;s <unk> that the menschlichen capacity to survive and <unk> , <unk> by the mental <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which is really <unk> .
Bis dahin , I think it &apos;s not what we do .
Now , this is the fact that <unk> that <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Now , let &apos;s face it .
Now , we can &apos;t take a lot of time just as you do a long time .
Now , it &apos;s like <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> , one of those things are <unk> .
I think that &apos;s the most exciting thing that I used to tell you was called <unk> .
What is it normal ?
It &apos;s not normal .
It &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s typical . It &apos;s not normal .
And how to do the poor , <unk> people who are <unk> ?
I thought it wasn &apos;t .
Now , as soon as it turned to <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , if we are <unk> with a lot of a lot of a lot of people who are <unk> .
<unk> would tell us that it &apos;s a single thing that people wanted to be suffering from their <unk> .
And he &apos;s going to be able to look at the <unk> of 60,000 things that are going to be <unk> and serious <unk> , which is going to be <unk> , which is going to be <unk> , which is going to be <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the people who are really <unk> .
Vor three years what I went to the park in town , I went to see in the United States in <unk> Pennsylvania , and I stand behind a <unk> .
It war a Sommer . I thought .
I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; I mean , &quot; when this is Aimee <unk> . &quot;
I went to see what war a <unk> . No way .
I said , &quot; Well , I know , well , people know ? I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And it said , &quot; What &apos;s going to do is that you can &apos;t know what you know .
When we were born , I &apos;ve got to get rid of the <unk> . &quot;
Oh , the mind .
And of course , much more than the <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m not going to give you an issue of my pain of the day , I came back to my <unk> of my day .
I mean , that &apos;s what I went to spend a little bit of food , which is what you see in Urlaub , so you know what I &apos;m looking at .
And because I don &apos;t know what to be born and <unk> songs and a few Zehen and a couple of Zehen in the front of the other and a half ago .
I said , &quot; I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on , &quot; I don &apos;t know what you can go and do not go in , and I don &apos;t want to go to the <unk> , and I don &apos;t want to be a <unk> , which is going to be <unk> .
And that &apos;s what I said that there was a <unk> , that , in fact , <unk> , and I went to the point of school , which is what I call a <unk> in the zweiten Klasse to the <unk> of <unk> , and my <unk> , to the <unk> of <unk> , my <unk> , of one of the <unk> , to the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , what it means is that it &apos;s called the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s no illusion , which seems to be a powerful thing in the same thing that you see on the conversation .
And Dr. <unk> went on , &quot; I said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to get rid of the time , and it &apos;s like , &quot; I don &apos;t get rid of it , and it &apos;s like a little bit of a different way . &quot;
Let &apos;s see , &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And it doesn &apos;t tell you , which is where you can do with the climate change .
Now , in the <unk> of the day , I think that when you give me a little bit of the time I used to give me a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> of real waves , when I came back to real time .
Let me go back to the <unk> .
Now , when ever , I don &apos;t know what it is .
That &apos;s what I mean , that &apos;s what I mean , not all of the issues that we do .
Now , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve got to do about this in my mind , which I was giving me a lot of people who gave me a little bit of the time that I wanted to <unk> .
Now , you know , you can &apos;t do a <unk> of the course of the course of your own force , and I want you .
When you tell you , you can pick up the Schlüssel to be able to do a <unk> , which would be <unk> , when you can do it , and you can &apos;t do it in case that you can do it .
You know , it &apos;s <unk> to a <unk> .
What the real sound of the sound is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
This is , &quot; I &apos;m going to see that , &quot; that you can see in a <unk> .
So , what do we want to go back ?
It was a <unk> in the &apos; 60ern in England , where they went to <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s called &quot; <unk> results . &quot; in the United States .
And they <unk> Studenten in 10 , nine , eight , seven , seven .
You know , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the best children , etc .
For three hours of three Monate , they gave us a 10 seconds to 10 , and I said that they were <unk> .
Am Ende of those three hours of the three decades .
Now , the <unk> of the study is that they said , &quot; <unk> the <unk> , &quot; which was the <unk> .
And it turns out for three hours .
You know , those who were in the market , people who are <unk> .
I mean , really , most interesting in the world war , which was the Lehrern .
They don &apos;t understand what it would be .
And he said , that these are the Studenten of <unk> , that the <unk> of four .
And so , that &apos;s what it went to is , and so forth .
Now , I think that the only real cure is a <unk> Geist , a <unk> Geist .
There &apos;s no mistakes .
And there &apos;s no one of the same thing that <unk> Neugierde is not very different and <unk> .
Now , when you do it , you can do the Geist , too , I think of it , Schönheit and others and others and others and <unk> , to be neugierig and <unk> .
And as a Geist , the <unk> <unk> , when it is , it &apos;s like , well , they can &apos;t be able to be able to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to stop looking at a friend of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I said , &quot; <unk> my Freund Jacques <unk> .
The Gedicht is called &quot; You know , that will be four . &quot;
You know , each one of those people don &apos;t think of , no one of the Gott of <unk> , no Gott of <unk> , but the Gott will be four of four , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Thank you .
