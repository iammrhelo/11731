A few years ago , at TED , Peter <unk> , &quot; This <unk> &quot; .
So this is very simpel . <unk> , <unk> , of 20 spaghetti , of 20 spaghetti , of a <unk> , of a marshmallow .
The marshmallow should be on top .
And then , hoewel it seems to be <unk> , it &apos;s really hard to be <unk> .
And I thought , well , it &apos;s a really interesting idea , and I created it in a <unk> .
It was a huge thing .
And sindsdien , I &apos;ve found about 70 workshops over the world , with students , <unk> and architect , and I &apos;m talking about <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and I &apos;m talking about some of them , which is some of them , and I &apos;m going to share some of them .
So now , the meeste people are starting to be <unk> .
So , you know , you know , who are more likely to be <unk> .
And then you stop a little bit of time in planning and organisatie . You &apos;re <unk> and <unk> ,
In fact , you &apos;re going to put a lot of time in the <unk> of time in the <unk> .
And finally , even after they don &apos;t have a time for them , somebody who takes the marshmallow and they &apos;re putting it back on the top , get a step back and forth .
And so , as soon as it turns out , the &quot; <unk> &quot; is &quot; <unk> &quot; by a &quot; <unk> &quot; , want the weight is <unk> and <unk> .
So , there &apos;s a set of people who are going to be more <unk> as others , as others , and in the <unk> of <unk> .
They are <unk> , they are <unk> , they are <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And then , yes , it &apos;s also teams who are more <unk> and <unk> , and as well , in the best , in the <unk> .
And it &apos;s pretty amazing .
And who we were , &quot; Oh , we didn &apos;t give them the hoogste torens , but the great <unk> of all .
Was they said , &quot; Who is it ? Why ? &quot;
And Peter says , &quot; <unk> of people are <unk> in the middle of the spaghetti sauce . &quot;
You don &apos;t stop in <unk> .
So , it &apos;s one of another .
And if you were <unk> , we were going to be <unk> , OK !
And we can see it .
So what happens when they put the marshmallow on the table , they didn &apos;t have a time where ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
<unk> ?
And what <unk> is , is starting to begin to see the marshmallow and prototypes , <unk> prototypes , of the marshmallow at the top , so that they have a lot of <unk> prototype prototypes .
<unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
and at each of the same time , those kids have instant feedback and was not .
So the cost , of course , is <unk> , but we can see what different teams do .
So , the age of that , for instance , is <unk> , <unk> , which is the helft , but not a lot of it is more , but not a big deal .
How is the <unk> ?
And architecten and ingenieurs , gelukkig .
<unk> is the <unk> .
And why ? Because they are <unk> and <unk> geometric patronen to be the <unk> of <unk> structuren .
CEOs are <unk> . But here &apos;s interesting .
<unk> man a <unk> <unk> in the team , they were significant .
It &apos;s <unk> . You see , &quot; This team will win . &quot;
You know what ?
because they have some of them <unk> .
You know what they call it .
And this team , and it turns out , and it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s important to be <unk> .
<unk> vaardigheden and <unk> and their number .
When you have 10 teams , the number of <unk> , you have a half of them .
And I started my time .
And I said , we have the <unk> .
So I also bot a <unk> award software for the same time .
So guess what ?
And guess what ?
Here . Not a team had a <unk> structuur .
So if you had a <unk> high <unk> , there would be the <unk> .
Is it not interesting that high <unk> effect ?
We <unk> these oefening in particular students .
So guess what ?
You know what &apos;s called the <unk> .
And so , of course , is , of course , of course , in the best .
You &apos;ve created that very <unk> .
So , we have <unk> lessen for us , over the <unk> of <unk> and success .
How would you say , &quot; Well , why does somebody invest in a <unk> time ? &quot;
And the point is , I help digital tools and processen , of course , teams to help teams , auto games , games and <unk> <unk> .
And what she does is the <unk> , and they &apos;re engaged in the <unk> aannames .
And the truth is , of course , every single project has zijn marshmallow .
And that &apos;s what we need to do is give us some gedeelde ervaring , a different <unk> of <unk> ,
And this is the waarde that is <unk> oefening .
And those of you who are involved , are <unk> .
It &apos;s a blog where you can see who you see the <unk> .
He &apos;s a <unk> .
You know some of the great examples of all the world , who are <unk> and <unk> .
He &apos;s <unk> .
And the basic thing , I think , is , I believe , is a <unk> sport .
We want to focus all our minds on that focus and if we think of our own <unk> , who we are in the world and our job , in the <unk> .
And of course , a smaller prototype of the experience of everything , we have a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- &quot; <unk> &quot; &#93; &quot; <unk> &quot; .
It &apos;s a big difference .
Thank you .
So we have a machine .
A big machine , a cool machine machine , and it &apos;s a tijdmachine .
and each of them needs to go .
You can go into that person .
And I &apos;m asking you , &quot; I mean , I want my vrienden to do it , because I &apos;ve been doing my vrienden at the last time . &quot;
I don &apos;t know . You were going to be at the time of the time for the car , of course , of course ,
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;m sure you have a little bit of <unk> , <unk> it .
And I can tell you .
I &apos;m not sure of this group , I &apos;m saying .
I don &apos;t want to go into that , and it &apos;s not because I &apos;m <unk> .
And it &apos;s because it &apos;s been <unk> on the planet .
And I also see in the machine , and I &apos;m going to go into that .
And this is the worst time die you had on the planet , of course , there is , of course , on the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And we had no time .
My <unk> stierven as they were 60 .
My grootouders were <unk> this .
My ouders are 80 on the <unk> .
So I also had a little closer to my <unk> .
But we don &apos;t know of people who are , want this is a big thing as it .
This is a kind of <unk> in New York .
I &apos;m thinking . It &apos;s a great fact .
And why is it ?
And those of the pokken . These authorities have been killed .
You know those of the <unk> of the world who were <unk> , who did not have a deal .
You are gone . You are verdwenen .
We have them <unk> . <unk> .
In the developing world , of course , of course , for a few years , of course , for a few years , for a generatie or not .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
Does anyone know what ?
So of course , of course , modern <unk> , our ability to feed human beings , which is <unk> of the science .
And of course , my vision is , of course , we &apos;re talking about it , of course , of course , of course , in the process of doing it , of course , of course , in the process of <unk> .
This is the good news .
But the reason is , it &apos;s all the good news , want he is some of the other problemen , and they were very well genoemd .
And one of them is , ondanks all of us , for all of us who have spent a million people on the world every day and every day .
and it turns out , and it turns out , and it &apos;s <unk> .
And we don &apos;t just do it , we have been <unk> the world , we were <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> country , regenwouden , gas , gas , gas , and then we &apos;re not going to verdwijnen in the chaos of chaos .
So the question is : Can we do it ? I think .
And I think it &apos;s obvious to me , that we &apos;re living in the <unk> of the world , without the country who is going to be <unk> .
I think , we can provide the world with energy , who are not <unk> .
I think it &apos;s not <unk> .
But I &apos;m sitting in bed right here -- one of the things that I &apos;m sitting over night .
and we were not allowed to be <unk> .
We are on the drempel of not the <unk> of <unk> . And yet , I think we can have 100 , 300 years from that Verlichting , we &apos;re going to be able to do things in which we have been <unk> over these things .
And those of them are <unk> in their beliefs , and so scary , they can &apos;t <unk> them .
They don &apos;t get them <unk> .
You know , each one of them has a law on its own .
So I don &apos;t know .
You don &apos;t have any of them any of them . <unk> , don &apos;t .
And I &apos;ve had a few years geduurd .
So I wrote about a decade ago , I wrote a artikel over &quot; The New Yorker . &quot;
And I was <unk> , I was <unk> to <unk> , who &apos;s at the time that was at the end of the day , was at the end .
And I didn &apos;t know what I was doing . I was only doing it . I &apos;ve been doing a artikel and I went out .
And I &apos;m sure I wrote a artikel over the <unk> of <unk> ,
All right .
These people were <unk> .
And I also wrote a artikel over here , and I couldn &apos;t figure out how those people thought , &quot; <unk> , &quot; so they were thought that molecules were in a very <unk> way in the <unk> of the natural world .
But I &apos;ve been doing it . I &apos;ve been doing the papers .
I &apos;m a journalist .
We love it , we &apos;re going to save , we &apos;re going to opeten it .
But this artikel made me <unk> , and I couldn &apos;t figure it out . And I found .
And it &apos;s because it &apos;s been <unk> that the <unk> weren &apos;t <unk> .
These were <unk> , <unk> people , <unk> people .
You were who those people in the room .
And I found myself so well .
And then I thought , well , we were not sure .
We have a place where we have not nearly the number of things .
We &apos;re <unk> .
And we &apos;re ironic , we have the little <unk> .
Okay , so we &apos;re talking about it , and I think of it .
And what we do is the result in instellingen , in the agency , and soms in the science of <unk> , and we &apos;re not talking about it .
A couple of names and the people have seen .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who <unk> 2000 .
I &apos;m sure you can do their own .
And we &apos;ve been asking them and we &apos;ve had some of the people who we were in , or we had to do it .
So I &apos;m asking you , desire .
Don &apos;t let you want .
But at the moment , &quot; If you need to be the bewijzen , &quot;
And I can tell you that we can live in a epidemie of fear , who I don &apos;t see . I &apos;ve never seen again .
So , of course , about 12 years ago , a story published , a <unk> verhaal , that the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> vaccin .
Very <unk> .
<unk> studies were <unk> , of course .
<unk> studies have been <unk> ; it &apos;s a great thing .
So the data came in .
So the data came up in the United States , from England , from Zweden , of Canada , and they were all the way .
It doesn &apos;t matter . It doesn &apos;t matter if we think of the <unk> , we &apos;re in the <unk> , we think we can see what we see is , we can see what we &apos;re facing .
We &apos;re not looking at a set of documenten or <unk> data , and I think it &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
But do you know ?
And the result was <unk> .
And for example , the United States is one of the world , one of the world is one of the countries in the world , in the <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> and we should be beschaamd .
It &apos;s <unk> .
And what did happen is ,
I snap it . I do .
So here is somebody <unk> ?
So if any of you in the audience have a single person to watch <unk> ?
Not very often .
<unk> in this country , but <unk> in the world .
It &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> , 20 per uur .
But because it &apos;s not here , we can do it , we can see the <unk> , and people who are <unk> and <unk> from <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of <unk> .
And they can do it , want they can &apos;t connect the world .
And you don &apos;t think that those things seem to be more accurate , but not the <unk> .
And it &apos;s something that we need to learn , and it &apos;s very snel .
This guy was a held , Jonas Salk .
And there &apos;s a result of our ergste <unk> .
no <unk> , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
This guy in the <unk> .
Paul <unk> .
There &apos;s a couple of others who have a <unk> .
There can be life of <unk> , 500,000 kids in the world in ontwikkelingslanden .
Pretty good , not ?
And so , it &apos;s good , for instance , that Paul <unk> and over vaccinaties and saying , &quot; Who is an amazing one of them to be <unk> .
And it tells you .
Paul is a terrorist .
When Paul in a <unk> <unk> , there can be no <unk> of any <unk> .
And there &apos;s a belt of <unk> , because those who tell them about them , they &apos;re going to tell you about their kids .
And why ? Because Paul had a vaccine .
I &apos;m not saying , but I can &apos;t tell you .
And then you know , you know , you know , those of them , of course , those of us who are <unk> , is <unk> .
We &apos;re now <unk> .
And it becomes <unk> , and it &apos;s very , very soon , again , and it &apos;s just a question .
and they were not just going to be <unk> .
So what does it mean by <unk> ?
And I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve been writing a couple of weken a couple of weken , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m a little bit <unk> .
No one was told you .
She would not be <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> .
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have a <unk> . You know ?
We didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
And now , I &apos;m not saying , well , now I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Oh , now I &apos;m going to have a little bit of a vliegtuig in Lagos and I &apos;m going to go back to Los Angeles .
and in a couple of weeks , there &apos;s a auto and <unk> a auto , and there &apos;s going to come out of Long Beach , and there is one of the <unk> <unk> .
And there is no one who &apos;s been <unk> with a <unk> ziekte , and we don &apos;t know , want this is the world .
This is the planeet .
We love to be <unk> . We love .
Have you been going to all your <unk> ?
<unk> , a little <unk> .
And I can tell you , because the half of the American person is doing every day .
And you take these things , and they take a new remedie , and it doesn &apos;t matter , who we &apos;re finding is not <unk> .
And those data points all the way .
You <unk> your urine . They don &apos;t .
You know , it &apos;s okay , you know 28 of 28 dollars for <unk> urine .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
<unk> urine . <unk> .
So why are we doing it ? Why are we doing it ?
I think -- I &apos;m <unk> -- we &apos;re <unk> .
We can do a great rule . We don &apos;t have vertrouwen in the system .
And we should not .
It &apos;s <unk> to miljoenen people .
It &apos;s absolutely amazing to us , <unk> us , who can do it .
So we &apos;re moving away from the road , and we &apos;re moving ?
We are moving into those <unk> .
It &apos;s great . I love the <unk> .
But you know , it &apos;s a serious thing , want it &apos;s <unk> , and we have a million dollars for it .
And I &apos;ve spent all of these little little <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , want I don &apos;t know if it is , but we have a dozen dollars for it , it &apos;s <unk> .
You know what ? When I say this , I mean , &quot; What are you going to do . &quot;
They feel good . &quot;
You know ? You were wrong .
And it &apos;s me , of course , of course , of course , of course , is the <unk> , who says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m talking about the <unk> of my experts in the field of <unk> , &quot; of some of them <unk> , of <unk> ,
And if you go out on the street , <unk> and <unk> and the same thing to do , you can &apos;t be there .
You have the <unk> in Zuid-Afrika .
And there would be 400,000 of us there , because there was a police officer , <unk> and <unk> a little bit of <unk> as an antiretroviral medicatie , whether we know that they can control the effects of AIDS .
honderdduizenden <unk> in a country , which is <unk> as well as any of these changes .
Don &apos;t tell me , don &apos;t have these gevolgen .
They have them . They have them .
Now , the <unk> epidemie , we &apos;re sitting here , is this absurd gevecht between the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
This is a <unk> debat .
It &apos;s a debat over the speech , over it .
It &apos;s ideologie , not science .
All the <unk> , every single day , every <unk> , each tak <unk> , is the <unk> of people .
You couldn &apos;t have a <unk> in the paradijs .
We didn &apos;t have a <unk> . We made it . We made everything .
We made it in the last few years .
And some of them are <unk> and <unk> .
We have <unk> , which is not <unk> .
We can now do it . And we can do it . And we can do it , but we can do anything who &apos;s vitamine A in the rijst , and those of them can help miljoenen people , miljoenen mensen , hun leven .
You know what ?
I &apos;m not saying .
We <unk> the <unk> of life .
So why do we do it ?
And I remember , I remember , to have a lot of chemicals , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we don &apos;t have a massive velden .
We don &apos;t know that business are <unk> .
We don &apos;t know that businesses are together .
And what I &apos;m saying is , okay ?
Yes , you have right . <unk> we .
We have a massive <unk> , but it &apos;s not science .
It doesn &apos;t have to do with science .
It &apos;s wet , moraliteit , <unk> .
And you know , you know , it &apos;s not a business .
It &apos;s no land .
She &apos;s not a mind ; it &apos;s a process .
Het is een proces , en soms werkt hij , en soms is het idee dat we de wetenschap niet zouden toestaan om hun werk in hun werk te doen omdat we bang zijn is een dood dood , en ze geeft miljoenen mensen van de tijd .
In the next 50 years , we have 70 percent more <unk> to the moment . 70 percent .
These days in Africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
You need it , and we don &apos;t .
And why ? <unk> is different .
We don &apos;t know people who are <unk> or <unk> , who are <unk> .
<unk> is a half miljard people .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
It &apos;s only a <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have any voedingsstoffen , it doesn &apos;t have a proteïne , and we &apos;re all the same .
and then they would be <unk> and not blind .
You were not going to be <unk> , and you know ?
It &apos;s not <unk> . It &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s mooi .
And everything I can tell you is , why are we <unk> ?
I &apos;m saying , &quot; Why are we <unk> ?
Because we don &apos;t have the genes <unk> ?
It &apos;s not over there , Gene <unk> . It &apos;s not over chemicaliën .
It &apos;s not over our belachelijke passie for our <unk> , our <unk> to care , to be living in a living room .
And it &apos;s not over Rice <unk> , it &apos;s over time , people in life , and it &apos;s the time where it &apos;s called .
You know ?
And if we don &apos;t do it , when we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing , we &apos;re not going to be guilty of what we do in the world .
And it &apos;s not any other feature .
It &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s us , it &apos;s us .
And at this point , I &apos;m saying , &quot; You know what ? &quot;
In any case .
And at the moment , they &apos;re now at the moment , but we have a huge capability .
We can ask the tijdmachine of everything .
We can <unk> them , and we &apos;re going to move them around .
We have these gesprekken , and we need to be thinking , but as we go into the <unk> and we &apos;re going to be in the middle of the world .
And I can tell you , we can do it , and I think it &apos;s what the world needs .
Thank you .
So , as Steve <unk> , <unk> the Los Angeles Times , a day of the straten in the Center of Los Angeles , hoorde a perfect muziek .
She came up with a man , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who had a viool of a viool who had just had a viool .
So , velen of them have been known , because of the story of <unk> artikels over the <unk> papers , as well as Steve <unk> , as Steve <unk> and Jamie <unk> as a <unk> Anthony <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> carrière <unk> by the <unk> of his <unk> .
<unk> verliet the Juilliard , I had a 30 years old and 30 years later , there would be a <unk> of <unk> Row in the center of Los Angeles .
Now , I &apos;m <unk> by reading all the , <unk> boek , of the film of the film , you know , not just the great part of the face of the <unk> , which is the same thing , as well as the muziek of the <unk> , but , net als the instrument of the type of <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
I ontmoette Mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the Walt Disney Hall .
There had a show that had a show of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and I was sitting around the podium .
There was a very <unk> and <unk> klei over Yo-Yo Ma , Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton and over the <unk> , and all the way in the back of the <unk> , and all over the back of the <unk> .
And we were going to talk about the <unk> . And a couple of dagen later , I received a e-mail called the <unk> of <unk> .
I &apos;m trying to say , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> a medische behandeling , want there is been <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , which is <unk> over his life .
And so , as a result , there is a lot more kwetsbaar for these <unk> fasen . And those of them are so <unk> , they are so <unk> , and there is a third of them , in the straten of <unk> Row , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> .
and in the case of the <unk> , when we were <unk> , when we saw the first <unk> in the Walt Disney Hall . There had been a <unk> <unk> in his ogen and had lost .
and there had been over some onzichtbare demonen , and it turns out that it would be <unk> , who were <unk> .
I was bang , not <unk> , but I was bang if I could lose them in some of the <unk> of <unk> , and I could have the band of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> and other thinking of the <unk> and <unk> and other thinking of the <unk> .
I started to play .
I found the first set of <unk> <unk> .
And then I remember , I realized that in <unk> , a total of the <unk> of the <unk> .
And it was , if there were , if there was a onzichtbare <unk> , there was a chemical <unk> die my game was ,
<unk> <unk> of boosheid <unk> , in a <unk> nieuwsgierigheid and <unk> .
and who came out of the <unk> , and then I found some of them some of the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> , and I said , &quot; Hey , I would say , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> .
So we started over the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and all of those others are <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
And I realized that there was not only a <unk> over the <unk> of the muziek , but they had a scary connection .
And there would be some of the people who were going to be a creative and a sense , I think of my own collega in the <unk> of Los Angeles .
And when there came out of the <unk> and over the <unk> , <unk> man , <unk> man , who had been <unk> by the straten of Los Angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the Juilliard <unk> .
So the same thing is about geneeskunde .
with <unk> <unk> .
And the thing that the muziek would be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> with the <unk> of the world of <unk> .
and there are a <unk> person .
And I realized that this is the truth of the art .
And so this is the case , why we &apos;re doing the same thing : we can put ourselves in all of us into the inside of the inside of the inside of us , our ability , in the face of our <unk> lens , by the way we can shape them .
And those of us who are already out of the world are already <unk> , and it &apos;s our job .
And what I did is the <unk> , and then I brought it back into the family of vrienden .
And the <unk> kracht of the muziek would be <unk> in a family of <unk> of muzikanten , who had the great talent of the <unk> .
and I &apos;m going to be more and more <unk> , of course , in the Walt Disney of the Disney World , of <unk> of <unk> of <unk> of in <unk> .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Thank you .
Robert Gupta .
Robert Gupta : So I &apos;m going to be doing something .
I hope , sorry .
I &apos;m Jane <unk> . I &apos;m <unk> .
I &apos;m starting to do all the 10 years old . And my job is for the next 10 years , it &apos;s even more <unk> in the world of the world , who is in <unk> .
I &apos;m talking about a plan . I &apos;m talking about more people , of course , you know , more time more and more <unk> games .
And now we spend three million hours a week in a week .
And some of you may be thinking , &quot; This is a hele long time for games . &quot;
So , we can think of a time when we &apos;re thinking about who we are in the real world in the real world .
In fact , my research research in the Institute for the present , is the omgekeerde <unk> .
Three miljard hours per week is not nearly enough , over the <unk> of the world .
In fact , I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to be in the same way that we &apos;re going to overleven in the same way that we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
I &apos;ve calculated that it &apos;s the time for 21 miljard weeks per week .
And it may be some of the same thing , as well as I can do , I can do it : if we are <unk> , right now , of course , we &apos;re going to be <unk> , right ?
And at the end of the day , it would be <unk> .
And why ? This image beschrijft best .
And why I &apos;m thinking , games are essentieel for the survival of human species in the future .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There would be the same thing called the <unk> . So there is a camera building .
This is one of the questions .
And if you don &apos;t have a load of <unk> , you may be some of the nuances .
So you can see this sort of <unk> , <unk> , but also <unk> focus on the face of a really tough problem .
And if you &apos;re doing well , you can see some of the nuances here , who are <unk> your eyes and your mond is <unk> . That &apos;s <unk> .
This is a speler die <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Oh , you know . Okay .
So we have a couple of women here .
A <unk> act is a resultaat , which is so <unk> , that you didn &apos;t know that it was all the way .
It was close to the <unk> . And if you do it , you are <unk> .
I mean , there &apos;s a <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> act .
And the second thing is a very <unk> act .
And this is what we &apos;re seeing on the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> over the world , when we take those of the <unk> of the world .
After all , we can see this face face in the real world , when we &apos;re facing a serious problem .
I call it like this : &quot; In Life , &quot;
And it &apos;s my face , can you see ? Yes ? OK .
This is what I &apos;m saying is &quot; In Life , &quot;
This is a graffiti in my <unk> in Berkeley in Berkeley , California , which I &apos;ve been studying in games as well as in games .
It &apos;s a problem with a problem .
We think we &apos;re not so good at the same time .
and I &apos;m not only doing it .
We &apos;re in <unk> .
I &apos;m going to share with you the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who are <unk> .
And if we &apos;re in a <unk> <unk> , I think we &apos;re taking all of us in the world of our best , and all the time and direct <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> the problem .
And in the same world , we &apos;re not <unk> . We feel very different .
We feel overweldigd . We &apos;re <unk> . We can be <unk> .
We don &apos;t have these gevoelens , when we play games , in games , they don &apos;t .
And it &apos;s what I &apos;ve been studying as <unk> .
So why is it in games impossible to think of it ?
So who can we put these emoties into the <unk> ?
So I &apos;m <unk> over the World of World of Warcraft .
And I found some of the things that were <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So , first of all , once in the <unk> of World or World of World of Warcraft , is a couple of different personages die are bereid zijn <unk> , and direct .
But it &apos;s not only a single missie , but a missie die perfect past , right ?
You know it .
You don &apos;t have a job that you can &apos;t fix .
But at the edge of your energy , we also need to be <unk> .
But it &apos;s not about werkloosheid in World of World of Warcraft . You are not <unk> and <unk> .
And he &apos;s <unk> .
But wherever you go to the world , share the number one with you , over your <unk> missie .
And we don &apos;t have a sense of living in the real time , this gevoel , in a <unk> <unk> .
And then , it &apos;s the <unk> geschiedenis , these inspirerende stories , why we have it . And we have a good feedback .
You know , you know , &quot; level of level , &quot; and &quot; + 1 <unk> &quot; and &quot; + 1 . &quot;
And this constant feedback is not in the real world .
When I &apos;m moving out of the podium , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s plus a <unk> idee , plus of 20 <unk> .
I don &apos;t hold in the real time .
So the problem of <unk> who is the World of World of Warcraft is , is that it &apos;s so bevredigend , on the edge of a <unk> <unk> , is that we spend all the time in the <unk> .
You know it &apos;s better like that .
And in the world today , all the World or <unk> miljoen jaar have been <unk> over the <unk> of <unk> .
It &apos;s not necessarily nothing .
Klinkt <unk> .
But in the context of the context : <unk> miljoen years ago , our first <unk> <unk> .
The first <unk> primaat .
OK , as we are over here , when we spend a lot of time at the time now , it &apos;s true , if you have the time when you look at the age of the age of <unk> of <unk> of <unk> .
But the same thing . Because it turns out , we can use the fact that we &apos;re doing all the time at the time of the game , which is what we &apos;re creating as people in the world .
We &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
This is the truth . I think .
When you see the interesting statistiek , the recent study of the Carnegie Mellon University : So the gemiddelde student in a country in a country in a country with a few days in a country met <unk> .
So , 10,000 hours is a very interesting getal , two of them .
In the early days , of course , in the middle of the Verenigde Staten , <unk> hours who are in school , in the middle of the school , in the middle of the High School .
<unk> , in the early days , of course , of course , is <unk> , who &apos;s in the <unk> .
And maybe some of you have the nieuwe book of Malcolm Gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot; So , you know , you know about the subject of success , which is why you know about the success of the success .
And what you &apos;re looking at is the great thing of the <unk> of <unk> , which is , as we have 10,000 hours to be at the age of 13 years old , we are <unk> .
So we were so good at doing , who are always in the <unk> world .
So , here we have , is a handful of young people who are <unk> .
So the great question is , &quot; Well , of course , &quot; Okay .
Because if we could use it , we had never had <unk> human talent .
So now we have a few people living in the world who are at least a half of a half .
This is our <unk> . 500 miljoen people who are in &quot; something . &quot;
And in the next 10 years , we have a half a half of the world who &apos;s really good at the same time .
If you don &apos;t have it ,
And that <unk> is <unk> , which is <unk> and <unk> in <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in India , in India , in India , in India .
You know a little more than a half of a 10 .
So we have half a half miljard gamers .
So I started thinking , well , it &apos;s what we call the games of games .
Here &apos;s the four things I found .
Okay , let &apos;s ask it as extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire , once again , we have a horde of <unk> , and we think we can have a <unk> hoop on success .
And the gamers always geloven is that a <unk> act as well as well .
<unk> are not .
<unk> are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And it &apos;s a little more interesting studies that show that we have people more happy when we have been <unk> .
And the point is , it &apos;s a part of the <unk> , with somebody &apos;s play play .
We &apos;re <unk> when we ask our time when we ask them , that those rules are <unk> , and we &apos;re at the <unk> .
So the <unk> can be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And as they &apos;re created , we &apos;re going to build larger social relaties .
<unk> productiviteit . Fantastic !
So you know , he &apos;s a reden , why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours a week is , as well as <unk> .
And the point is , when we &apos;re going to spelen , we &apos;re really happy to be <unk> , if we &apos;re going to do it , and not do .
We know if we think of the human nature optimaal , when we do hard ,
and gamers are always right , hard to be <unk> .
And then , <unk> matters .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So here we have a <unk> , there &apos;s all of the Wikipedia . You know all of the Wikipedia , the grootste <unk> of the world .
The biggest <unk> <unk> in the world , with fast 80,000 <unk> is the World of Warcraft .
Vijf miljoen people every single day .
So you have more information about World or World of World Fund as well as a different part of the world .
You created a epic .
You have a epic authority over the World of Warcraft .
All right , it &apos;s four <unk> die you have .
These are people who believe they can change the world .
And the only problem is , they can change the virtual worlds , but not that .
It &apos;s the problem , I &apos;m trying to do .
Edward <unk> is a <unk> .
His job is awesome . There &apos;s some of them .
So people have a lot of time , energy and money in <unk> .
and there says , &quot; We were experiencing not as a <unk> in virtuele werelden and <unk> . &quot;
And it &apos;s a economist . It makes sense .
And there &apos;s no way I &apos;m -- I &apos;m playing games , I &apos;m <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a sense of <unk> , want the world can be more <unk> as in <unk> .
You know , you can <unk> <unk> social bonds as in the real world . You can get more feedback and <unk> in games as in games .
Now , there &apos;s a real sense of the world in the same way that is more time in the world .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
But it &apos;s not <unk> .
We need to turn the actual world into a dish .
My inspiratie is coming from a gebeurtenis , the 2,500 years <unk> .
So here is the <unk> kubus . You know ?
And so this wonderful <unk> .
And what we were saying is , of course , <unk> of people who were <unk> . And then you know , you know , with the <unk> Griekse <unk> <unk> , so you know , you know , this story .
Laut <unk> werden games , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> was a <unk> of <unk> , that the koning of <unk> came out .
These people were <unk> . These days .
It was a extreme <unk> . You had a extreme .
And they created , I think , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> a national strategie . On one day , we would love you .
And so they would have been <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , want games are so fascinerend and we have <unk> , <unk> productiviteit , so they were not going to eten .
And then , the same day , the same day , and the same day , you would call it .
And according to <unk> , they were 18 years old for them , they would put them back on a day , and in the same <unk> .
Even , I think we &apos;re playing games .
We &apos;re <unk> games om to <unk> the lijden of the absolute world . We &apos;re <unk> -- we &apos;re not doing it in the real world , it &apos;s not <unk> in the real world , we &apos;re doing it in the real life .
But we don &apos;t need it .
This is the <unk> .
Laut <unk> wurde 18 Jahre alt .
You took the koninkrijk in half .
You were <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
You walked out of <unk> and then went to the <unk> . You know , so many of the people who were going to be <unk> , who were able to overleven and we were <unk> by the rest of them .
Klinkt <unk> , of course ?
But the nieuwste <unk> show shows that the <unk> Reich of the <unk> , who had the <unk> in the old <unk> .
And so the scientists at the time came to the notion of <unk> , <unk> ,
And geologists could see a World Trade Organization , who had nearly 20 years geduurd that could be <unk> .
Now , this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
And so , you know , you know , you know , they would have been gered door them to have 18 years in games , and they have been <unk> over 18 years in games , and so many of them have been <unk> over the <unk> .
We can also .
We &apos;ve been writing about 1994 .
This was the first time in real time .
the World <unk> . It &apos;s 16 years old .
You spent 18 years old , we &apos;ve been writing about 16 years .
I &apos;m <unk> , we are , we are , we are .
And now , they would come back that half of their beschaving on the zoektocht naar a new world . So I &apos;m following my 21 miljard <unk> per week .
We should be <unk> , that half of us a half of us every day with games , until we have the real world opgelost .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; Well , who are we going to solve the world of the real world .
And in games ? &quot; And the question I did is I &apos;ve spent my job in the last years in the Institute of Medicine .
So we have this <unk> in the room in Palo Alto , it sounds out of who we should understand .
We &apos;re not trying to do the toekomst .
So what we &apos;re doing is the toekomst .
We &apos;re also the best chance . And then men are <unk> .
We ask us to be epic <unk> and we have people who can deal with them .
I &apos;m showing you three games that I &apos;m ontworpen om to give them a <unk> <unk> in their future .
This is &quot; the world without &quot; .
This game is in 2007 .
It &apos;s a <unk> die you need to be <unk> .
De <unk> is uitgevonden , maar we hebben genoeg <unk> om jullie echt te laten leven en jullie echt leven zonder olie .
who can be <unk> , of schools are <unk> , of it can be <unk> . And you need to be able to figure out how to be . And we &apos;re asking you , over blogging , of course .
So we were testing this match with <unk> spelers in 2007 . And we have the last three years out .
And I can tell you , it was a <unk> ervaring .
Nobody wants to be <unk> because it &apos;s good for that milieu , of it .
But then you know in a <unk> avontuur and I said , &quot; Well , we &apos;re moving off . &quot;
It &apos;s an <unk> avontuur .
And if you try to figure out what they &apos;re going to do . And the meesten of the people who have been doing in the game of <unk> gewoontes .
So we have a larger match for the next <unk> .
We have the game called &quot; <unk> &quot; in the Institute of Medicine .
So the thing is that the calculation of a <unk> is that those who are only 23 years on the planet .
This supercomputer , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; yes .
That gives us a <unk> , <unk> , we have a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
You know , Jerry <unk> , which is the &quot; <unk> &quot; . You have the astronauten , the astronauten , the <unk> , and they can redden them .
But we &apos;re in the game , in the days of only five people , we can say , it &apos;s our job , and it &apos;s our job , that is our job , and it &apos;s our job , and the rest of the sociale justice .
8,000 spelers speelden the game over eight weken .
You know 500 rare creatieve oplossingen die you can read .
And the final match we have is three maart . It &apos;s a match in the <unk> .
When you &apos;re doing the match , you go from the World Bank called the award &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; .
We are talking about schools in all the world &apos;s Pacific and <unk> them .
We have a strip over . We have degrees at the heart of <unk> , <unk> , duurzaamheid and <unk> .
I &apos;m trying to share with you all the way to share this match with young people , over all of them in the world , especially in <unk> , die in all of them are <unk> , over the world , in the world .
I &apos;m at the end .
I &apos;m asking you .
So guess what ?
We have all the wonderful spelers , we have games that show us , but we have the real world nor gered .
Well , I hope , I &apos;m sure you are out of the person who are in the real world , who we can use in the real time in the real world , and that games are a big difference .
We have all these <unk> , <unk> productiviteit , who gave them , scary social <unk> , <unk> and the desire for <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m hoping that we &apos;re going to be great games , and we &apos;re going to overleven in the same world .
And I hope , you know , you know what games are and I speel .
When I &apos;m in the early days of <unk> , I &apos;m sure of two things : we can have all of these <unk> toekomst , and we can play all the games .
Thank you .
And I &apos;ve been fascinated with some of my time . He may be raar .
Met other woorden , <unk> has shown in some of of andere studies , the <unk> , and it &apos;s only because it &apos;s because the person thinks , it &apos;s a <unk> of , of a type of , of a type of , of a <unk> effect , in the <unk> effect of the body , which is , of course , is : &quot; When the patient is so hard to be in the <unk> .
A act becomes <unk> , want somebody can see .
So we also understand , I &apos;m going to give you a <unk> , very simple <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to show you who it does . And it &apos;s a trick die we have .
And I said , &quot; You know what I called the <unk> Magic Magic <unk> in the 1970s .
I &apos;m going to talk to you and leg it .
And then I &apos;m talking about it .
So , you see ,
And the mes that you can see ; my hand can look .
So I &apos;m going to do that mes .
I <unk> my mouw .
And of course , I &apos;m not going to get it away from my mouw , of course , I &apos;m moving my pols right here .
And I can see you can see that no of the time is moving . I can &apos;t move around here .
And the goal is very simpel .
I &apos;m going to open up my hand , and hopelijk , when everything goes up , the messen will hit me through my <unk> .
There &apos;s a really strong thing that I can tell you , without any <unk> .
He &apos;s not moving into my mouw of his mouw , of it .
<unk> !
So , it &apos;s a trick die I do most of the time I &apos;ve been thinking , well , of course , you know , you know , of <unk> , want you know a little bit about misleiding , as well as you know of <unk> , as well as we are <unk> ,
There may be many of you here in the room .
So the same thing .
I hold the mes in my hand .
I mean , I can tell you my pols of my pols , and I &apos;m not going to end up in the <unk> of my mouw .
And the point is , why I &apos;m my pols <unk> , is the real <unk> system .
In the moment of my hand , I can see my hand of hands , I can see the vinger here , my <unk> , my <unk> , and there is , in the position of where there &apos;s been <unk> .
<unk> ?
And so on the road , somebody who had no time .
So there &apos;s been here .
and then I get <unk> the vinger of the vinger .
And now you might be able to reason why it &apos;s not <unk> , why don &apos;t you think of any of them here are only three vinger here : the <unk> and the type of <unk> , is one of them .
But here &apos;s not all right here . And then I open my hand .
And it turns out , but not by the appearance of my body , but it &apos;s not the magnetisme , but by a trick , by my <unk> .
And if I put my hand in front of my hand , it &apos;s only door me to be <unk> by the <unk> , that the senses are <unk> .
I &apos;m taking his hand out . And here &apos;s a mes .
These trick can be your vrienden and buren . Thank you .
So what did we do met the <unk> ?
So , of course , of course , I read a study , I read a study die me really <unk> .
I &apos;m not a doctor , of course , and I was a wonderful thing .
And the question is , &quot; If you give a placebo in the type of a blank wheel , in the form of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a ronde , as a <unk> effect .
But then , if you give up the same , in a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , and the blauw <unk> and one letter is <unk> , is <unk> .
And then , of course , not any of them are <unk> .
But a blank wheel is not so <unk> as a sun .
Was ? It made me <unk> .
And it turns out , it wasn &apos;t everything .
When you multiply <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> as any of them .
So , a <unk> capsule , which on a block of geel and so forth , is as much as a blank capsule .
All right .
A pil tweemaal per dag is not so <unk> as three dozen -- I &apos;m sorry .
But the thing is ,
... that also can be the <unk> .
And that &apos;s the same thing .
And if you have the <unk> <unk> , you need to be <unk> .
Right ? A <unk> -- a couple of <unk> -- some of them <unk> a <unk> substantie die man <unk> .
It makes a very strong picture in the mind . It &apos;s a very much more <unk> as a blank wheel .
And the graph is -- I &apos;m going to give them a different keer .
And the same thing is , it doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> who doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> who doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> as a capsule .
No one of them has a really <unk> eigenschap . It &apos;s our belief system in our own <unk> .
I &apos;m supposed to be , of course , I could use this idee to the <unk> .
So , I &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s obvious .
And we can tell you , yes , we need to be <unk> .
This is a 18 cm long line . It &apos;s very , very , very <unk> . And I &apos;m a little bit <unk> .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is my love . This is not <unk> Hollywood .
So I &apos;m going to put up the naald in my body , and I pull back from them back to them .
So if you &apos;re <unk> -- if you were <unk> in <unk> -- I &apos;ve had a couple of vrienden last night on the hotelkamer , and some of the people who I didn &apos;t know is a <unk> .
So , as well as I &apos;m going to ask you , I &apos;m going to look at the next 30 seconden .
You can see it can be <unk> .
So , right here , right here , right here , I &apos;m going to put my two <unk> my body .
Sorry about it . Power ? You know ?
And just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit door my skin , and so on the others .
And now we are in the same place that we had the <unk> .
So .
But now you can &apos;t do my vingers .
So , I &apos;m going to show you . This is a , two , three , four , five .
Yeah .
I know what those people think .
And you say , &quot; Okay , it &apos;s not so <unk> and <unk> to us all the time . &quot;
So I &apos;m going to show you .
So who &apos;s here ? Very good .
Yes , I can tell you . And the same thing .
And those of you who go into the <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to show you .
This is my love . It &apos;s not <unk> Hollywood .
It &apos;s my <unk> , and I can do it .
Sorry . When you &apos;re <unk> , let &apos;s look away .
And those of them , of those who , of course , of those who look at the same time , would say , &quot; Well , yeah , it &apos;s a <unk> , but if it really did , it &apos;s a <unk> , but if it really did , there &apos;s a gat , and then it would be <unk> . &quot;
Okay , let me stop <unk> .
Yes , right here .
And I &apos;m likely to be doing it .
I would lift my arm out and show you , want no <unk> .
But I &apos;m thinking , in the context here , and we have a little bit of a <unk> , I &apos;m going to put it into a <unk> .
We have a couple of seconds .
And I hope , you &apos;re happy . Thank you .
So I &apos;ve known a little of the world .
I had two of them .
And the first thing is more than a gepassioneerde <unk> .
It was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
It &apos;s a little blue .
In the case of <unk> , we were <unk> by <unk> of <unk> .
You could also be <unk> .
I had a band met the <unk> .
A day , the Chef of the company belde the CEO of the <unk> .
&quot; Yes , &quot; I said .
So here &apos;s a company die we had to put up in the <unk> of the <unk> . So , who we have is <unk> for our <unk> ?
In the last 50 years , we have the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s hard to <unk> .
90 percent of the big vissen die we love , who we love the tonijnen , the <unk> , <unk> , is <unk> .
It &apos;s not much more .
So , of course , of course , of course , <unk> , <unk> , one of the rest of our species .
And many of them are <unk> . <unk> <unk> that milieu , and they are <unk> , we are <unk> .
There is a <unk> 15 .
So it &apos;s about 15 pond <unk> .
Not very well .
Not very good .
So here &apos;s a company die probeerde ,
I was <unk> .
And the day after the event , I call the CEO of the <unk> .
Don &apos;t we call it .
&quot; Don &apos;t tell me , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; just for the reason for the reason , you have to be so <unk> in the <unk> , so far in the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; This is true . &quot;
And then we put it in , &quot; We are a certain world .
This is <unk> by 2.5 .
&quot; That &apos;s the best in business . &quot;
2.5 . 2.5 .
&quot; Two hundred and <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> proteïnen . &quot;
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
And of course , I was sitting in bed , and I thought , &quot; What about it is a <unk> proteïne ?
So I belde the same day , even since the event .
And I said , &quot; Well , was , &quot; Well , is duurzame proteïnen ? &quot;
And there said , &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing . &quot;
I <unk> some of the people in the office . No one could have had a <unk> .
Don &apos;t we call it .
&quot; Don &apos;t I say , &quot; &quot; Is it , &quot;
Well , there &apos;s a couple of rocks and some <unk> , and then said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
And there said , &quot; Yes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; Who &apos;s a big deal of <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
So maybe two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Don &apos;t know , &quot; I said , &quot; Well , was to be <unk> on the vissen ? &quot;
And it had a long time on the board , and there said , &quot; You know , it &apos;s just to be a <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;m <unk> by this .
I don &apos;t want , want I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
I am .
And I &apos;m not talking about <unk> in the <unk> , because , I &apos;m <unk> by God , the one of the things I &apos;m talking about .
This is another type of <unk> .
And it &apos;s the Romantic type , which is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know what you &apos;ve known about ,
I took them into a restaurant in <unk> .
And a <unk> journalist had been out of this .
You have <unk> .
There was a <unk> , as a <unk> , <unk> witte light .
The chef had been sold .
Hold on .
<unk> was still <unk> .
So what can you do as well as a little <unk> , after being sold ?
I can &apos;t , but I can do it .
There are Miguel . There is Miguel .
And nee , there &apos;s not bought the World Trade Organization , and there &apos;s no kok . There &apos;s no way .
There is a bioloog called <unk> La <unk> .
This is a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
She &apos;s at the <unk> of the <unk> .
This was the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you made it , door them <unk> .
And you created this ingewikkelde set of <unk> , and then put water out of the land , and then in the rivier .
And they didn &apos;t matter because it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
<unk> was a ramp .
This is 90 percent of the <unk> , for a few of them .
And of course , 1982 did a <unk> <unk> in the country .
What did they do ?
You have the flow of water the water .
You have the hefbomen <unk> .
In the case of the water <unk> , they used the block of ice cream .
You <unk> that block .
So you have a <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and of course Miguel , and the <unk> of the habitat .
That is <unk> .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve never seen .
And you &apos;re looking at the horizon , which is <unk> a million kilometers away , and everything is flying <unk> kanalen and the dense , <unk> .
I was no longer the time with Miguel .
There is a giant person , three of them Charles Darwin and one of them called a <unk> .
So we were and we were <unk> door those <unk> and I <unk> and <unk> , <unk> of my knieën , and Miguel in a <unk> .
So here &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s the <unk> of fytoplankton .
And here , there is a <unk> of <unk> die you see on the <unk> giraffe .
And it turns out , Miguel in the <unk> National Park in the <unk> National Park in Africa .
I &apos;m asking them , who have become more <unk> .
And there said , &quot; Yes ? I don &apos;t know about it .
I &apos;m an expert . &quot;
And then you go and turn it into more gepraat , or there &apos;s a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
And I &apos;m not very <unk> , it &apos;s really fascinerend , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so on the way .
It &apos;s great , but I was <unk> .
and my head is zwak over this machine named <unk> <unk> die I am <unk> .
And I said it . I said , &quot; Miguel , who &apos;s going to be <unk> ? &quot;
There was a <unk> .
&quot; I know , &quot; I know , you , the <unk> , the fytoplankton , which is <unk> .
So what could you save ?
How is that <unk> ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to tell you , I mean , it &apos;s a <unk> systeem , is the <unk> system , in the wild .
And those <unk> biomassa , the fytoplankton , the <unk> , which is the <unk> .
So , this is so gezond , it &apos;s <unk> .
We don &apos;t .
You know , you know , you know , you know , or you know , who &apos;s not <unk> their bodies ?
And I went back and I said , &quot; Well , I said , &quot; I said , &quot; Well , I said , &quot; Well , I said , &quot; Well , I said , &quot; Well , I said , &quot; You know what ? &quot; , as I said , &quot; You know what ? &quot;
At the moment , as a result , it would have a <unk> <unk> .
And we see that we were looking at the <unk> , and our bot looked at the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , a fully <unk> tapijt .
&quot; It &apos;s been <unk> , &quot;
&quot; Look , your <unk> <unk> .
&quot;
<unk> ? I was a war .
I said , &quot; Miguel , <unk> it not you ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; We lose 20 percent of our world and <unk> those vogels .
And at the last year , 600.000 of 600,000 flies , as well as 250 different .
It &apos;s the grootste and one of the great private <unk> in Europe .
And I said , &quot; Miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last person who &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
There are a turn out of your head .
And there said , &quot; We &apos;re <unk> , not <unk> .
This is a <unk> netwerk .
That <unk> those <unk> .
That <unk> the <unk> .
So your <unk> <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
Well , we &apos;re thinking of it . So , a boerderij die their own dieren are not <unk> and a boerderij , which is the <unk> of their <unk> .
A <unk> , but a <unk> .
Oh , and we should not have the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> in a <unk> of 240 miles , which is the <unk> of <unk> .
They have 240 kilometers away .
Every single one of them is 240 kilometers away .
You know , because they can see the <unk> witte line of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
I had a tour of the study of the pinguïns , I went back .
I said , &quot; Miguel ? &quot; I said , of course , they are 150 miles away from the Farm and then fly 240 miles .
Are they doing it for those kids ? &quot;
And I would like to look at it , if I had a lied out of Whitney Houston .
And there said , &quot; No . You know it , want this is <unk> . &quot;
I didn &apos;t tell that huid my <unk> , who &apos;s heerlijk , and I &apos;m not <unk> . I can &apos;t <unk> them . I can &apos;t <unk> them .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> .
I don &apos;t <unk> .
And if I did them in the restaurant , I did not dance to <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> it , as well as you would take a <unk> of the ocean .
I said it over Miguel and there .
And there said , &quot; That &apos;s the <unk> .
This is the burden of <unk> .
And you &apos;ve grown in the process of evolutie , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And then , &quot; But what our water does is not <unk> . &quot;
Okay . So , a boerderij die their vissen are not <unk> . This is a boerderij where they meet their <unk> .
And then I realized , if there &apos;s a boerderij , there is a boerderij that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , because the water goes out of the water that goes out of the water <unk> .
It &apos;s a bridge , all of them , and all of them , of course , is <unk> over the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of <unk> .
And then , it &apos;s <unk> door the <unk> , and this is the water <unk> , as well as <unk> .
So , this system is so gezond , it <unk> water .
Niet alleen a boerderij die hun dieren <unk> , niet slechts een boerderij die hun succes meet in de gezondheid van hun <unk> , maar een boerderij die letterlijk een <unk> is , en niet alleen voor die vissen , maar ook voor de vissen .
When the water <unk> , <unk> it in the water .
So a little bit of a little bit in the ocean , I &apos;m sure , but I &apos;m going to do it , want these <unk> , as romantic , is <unk> .
And you could say , &quot; Well , it &apos;s a recept for those days , &quot; for example , of <unk> , of <unk> of <unk> .
And what we &apos;re doing is , it &apos;s a different nieuw concept in the <unk> , or in the <unk> .
But for many people , it &apos;s a little bit .
We are not <unk> , we <unk> . We are <unk> .
We love <unk> . We love a little bit of little <unk> . We &apos;re <unk> .
And if you want to say , &quot; Hey , I &apos;m like , &quot; Hey , I &apos;m like , &quot; Hey , I &apos;m like , &quot; Hey , I &apos;m like , &quot; Hey , I &apos;m like , &quot; Hey , I love <unk> <unk> , but who are going to feed the world ?
who are going to feed the world ? &quot;
Is it ?
I &apos;m not saying .
Not because we have enough calorieën to feed all the world .
A million people are <unk> .
So a million -- it &apos;s more like you -- by <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m not allowed to , because it &apos;s called the mathematics of our <unk> that has been <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , of <unk> on that Earth , kip on the Earth , and all the time has been asked to be : &quot; When we have more <unk> to them ? &quot;
It was the case . It was the <unk> . It was the <unk> of the Amerikaanse landbouw .
We should call them , it &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> the productie .
It &apos;s not <unk> , and it &apos;s not <unk> .
So our <unk> is now , not by <unk> <unk> , but by <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not the <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> land , not by pompen , but by <unk> water , not by <unk> , but by <unk> water , and not by <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> and <unk> , but by the vissen .
Are you going to feed the world ?
So what are we going to do : who are we going to feed ourselves ?
Of course , of course , who can do any of them , who would enable any of them to feed each of them ?
And we don &apos;t look at the <unk> of the <unk> .
It &apos;s real and it &apos;s done .
And kapitaal , chemistry and machines have been <unk> and it &apos;s not really good at the food system .
And what we &apos;re looking at is this <unk> model .
This is what it looks like .
So I &apos;m looking at Miguel , <unk> of <unk> .
So , those of them , who are not in the world , they &apos;re <unk> , in the process of <unk> , in the process of <unk> , in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that are not just <unk> , but experts for gender .
And they are the ones that are experts for nature .
And if I &apos;m really sure , they are a <unk> kok as well .
You know , it &apos;s me right , want if it &apos;s good enough , it &apos;s <unk> .
Thank you .
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> .
When I went to school , I went back and forth a half a half a day .
and my neus put in a book , in a book called <unk> , which is my mind in some of my world <unk> and <unk> my <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And these concepts were , as I remember , when I was not in the school , by the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> and &quot; monsters , &quot; and the monsters , etc . and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and all of them .
I was absolutely <unk> .
In the process of trying to figure out the world of the world , and the limits of the matter .
And my love to science fiction is <unk> in my <unk> , because when , at the back of the 1960s , we came across the back of the 1960s .
Jacques Cousteau came out in our living room with the <unk> show , who had us , and we have some of the world and we have a world full of <unk> die we had to do .
And it &apos;s very good at the <unk> <unk> .
And I was kunstenaar .
I was <unk> . I could schilderen .
And no of them , nor was the <unk> of the <unk> films , or the <unk> of all the <unk> of the medialandschap , I would have these beelden in my mind .
We had all the time . When we had a book called the book , we have the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> them on the screen .
And my judgment was , tekenen of <unk> , of aliens , of aliens , <unk> , etc . .
In the <unk> , I found myself out of the <unk> , who I found , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
That &apos;s what we did .
And what I did is , it &apos;s interesting . And what I did was , I was fascinated with Jacques <unk> , I was fascinated with Jacques <unk> ,
I don &apos;t think of the aliens in a ruimteschip world . And I did not have a very onwaarschijnlijk .
But here was a world that I could live in the Earth &apos;s house , and she was even curious and exotic and exotisch .
I learned when I was 15 , <unk> .
And the only problem was , I lived in a little village in Canada , 3,000 miles away from the back .
I &apos;m not <unk> .
I <unk> my vader , totdat there was a <unk> in Buffalo , New York , of the other side of the <unk> , on the other side of the <unk> ,
I found my <unk> in a very <unk> <unk> in Buffalo , New York .
But the oceaan , a real time , I remember two years later , I remember two years later .
In the 40 years , that &apos;s where I &apos;ve been <unk> , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours in water . 500 hours in <unk> .
And I &apos;ve learned that the world of the world , in the <unk> of the <unk> oceanen , is so rich in <unk> lives , who we can do .
And those of us who don &apos;t know about the world can &apos;t understand the limits of our , <unk> menselijke verbeelding .
And at the moment , I think at the moment , I &apos;m very <unk> , for my <unk> .
My love in the ocean is <unk> , except for one of the <unk> .
And if I was like volwassene a job <unk> , it was the film .
And so this was the best time , my innerlijke drang , of my <unk> , of my <unk> , of <unk> .
As a kind of , I tekende all the <unk> and so .
And then movies of the pad , images and music together .
And those of them were , of course , I &apos;m <unk> , &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; Terminator . &quot;
In &quot; <unk> , &quot; I could see my <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> my both <unk> .
And it &apos;s interesting : &quot; <unk> &quot; &#91; &quot; <unk> &quot; : So , we were able to put a <unk> problem in the film -- so we had a different <unk> <unk> -- we have a <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
So , of course , the first <unk> <unk> die you saw in a film .
And the film didn &apos;t have geld , there would be just a little bit of the <unk> , but I noticed a great deal : the publiek over the world , who had been <unk> over the world who were <unk> .
So , Arthur Clarke &apos;s wet &apos;s wet , is <unk> <unk> and <unk> to others .
And then you saw something called <unk> .
And I was very excited .
And I said , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s hard to be <unk> in the <unk> . &quot;
So we went in &quot; Terminator 2 &quot; , my film , a little bit .
So we created the <unk> of <unk> , we had the <unk> of vloeibaar metaal . And the result is very , very similar .
And it werkte . We had a little bit of <unk> . And the impact of the person is .
Through both of them , a very recent world , a very recent world , a very different world of medicine .
So I startte a bedrijf , and I met my great vriend <unk> Winston , die at the time of the best <unk> and <unk> .
And this was the idea of this company , which is , of course , <unk> processen , and we started getting rid of the <unk> <unk> , etc .
And this is what we did as well as a <unk> .
But in the middle of the 90 years , we noticed that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- for the company , we had to <unk> -- too .
I had written this stukje &quot; Avatar &quot; , which <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> effects in very many ways , in the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> human , <unk> personages , who were <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> <unk> . And those of them in my company said , &quot; We could not be <unk> . &quot;
So I made it , and I found this different film over the big schip , so on .
I mean , by <unk> , I called &quot; Romeo and Julia on a boat . &quot;
<unk> , but I was in the absolute <unk> of the Titanic .
I made the film .
This is the truth . The only thing .
And I found them , I said , &quot; We &apos;re out of the <unk> . We &apos;re filming the <unk> .
We have shown in the <unk> of film .
It &apos;s a big deal . It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and I <unk> them , a <unk> .
It sounds <unk> . But it &apos;s going to be more <unk> .
So we created six maanden later a reality , in a very <unk> <unk> trip , four kilometers on the surface of the <unk> , and I see the real Titanic by <unk> .
This was not a film , no <unk> , it was really .
And it &apos;s me <unk> .
And those of the things that were incredible . We had camera cameras and <unk> and everything .
And I noticed , who are the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
After all , they were <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
You turn into the capsule , then you are <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> environment , which is not going to be <unk> .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s even more than a <unk> .
It &apos;s cool . &quot;
I was the <unk> of the <unk> .
And of course , of course , the <unk> and <unk> . It was all . It was all .
And it was a <unk> die me Hollywood could not have .
And I could tell you , I could imagine a different <unk> effect . But I couldn &apos;t tell you what I was thinking of the <unk> effect .
And then some of the number of the <unk> , I &apos;ve seen some of the same thing , and I don &apos;t see that before I had never seen before , or anything that nobody had ever seen before , and the same thing that didn &apos;t have had any of them before .
And it &apos;s me very <unk> , and I &apos;m talking about .
And I had a little bit of a <unk> keuze .
And after the result of the Titanic , I said , &quot; Okay , I &apos;m going to tell my <unk> as a filmmaker in Hollywood on a ice shelf . &quot;
And then we started the <unk> .
We called the <unk> , and <unk> them met <unk> .
We went to the <unk> of the Titanic .
We had a little robot die we had built , die a <unk> <unk> .
And we were <unk> , <unk> , and we were looking at the inside of the <unk> , was not done .
And no one was the <unk> of the <unk> . He had no tools . We had the tools .
And then I &apos;m sitting here , and I &apos;m sitting in the dek of the Titanic , in a <unk> , and I &apos;m looking at the <unk> of the <unk> , and I can tell you that what I &apos;m saying is that what I found is that you have the band done .
and I &apos;ve been <unk> by a little <unk> .
I <unk> it , but my bewustzijn is within the <unk> .
And it voelde me , if I was <unk> in the <unk> of the Titanic .
This was the <unk> of a <unk> die I found . Because before I came across a <unk> , I had always been out of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , because I had been <unk> over the film .
And the option was a very , very , very well , the <unk> of the <unk> .
And this was a pretty sad ervaring .
And you know me , I realized that you have <unk> <unk> <unk> , and you can understand your own bewustzijn in the voertuig , in the other , in the same way .
It was absolutely <unk> .
and maybe a little bit of a little bit of , perhaps , could be able to be able to do some of them in some of the world of <unk> , as well as other things , in all of these things , in all sorts of <unk> , which I think of as <unk> .
And at this stage , we began to see that we had been on the surface of the <unk> . And we were <unk> , as well as the <unk> of the <unk> . This is alien <unk> , but here is a <unk> .
You live by <unk> .
You &apos;re not in the <unk> <unk> , who we do .
And then you see some of the people who are looking at a 500 graden Celsius .
<unk> . And you can &apos;t imagine that they can overleven .
At some time , I was still involved in <unk> , which was the <unk> of my career .
And so I ended up with the people who are geïnteresseerd in the space , and the NASA and the NASA in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> . You are moving around Rusland , <unk> the <unk> protocol and then <unk> the <unk> protocol and <unk> , and then we are <unk> by the international <unk> , and then we take our <unk> .
It &apos;s fascinerend .
But at the end of the day , it took me to the <unk> .
I took them out of them , and I went to the world on the world : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , people who were engaged in extreme situaties , and I took them into the <unk> of them , and I started using them .
We had <unk> , but we had to say , <unk> .
So the cirkel is taken between my bestaan as <unk> , as kind of as kind of , and the thing in the world .
And I &apos;ve been studying this <unk> .
I &apos;ve learned a little bit about science , but I &apos;ve known about <unk> .
You know , you know , a <unk> can be <unk> , a tree can be <unk> .
I didn &apos;t think of any of the <unk> , for I have these expedities <unk> .
And I said , &quot; Well , I would say , &quot; Well , what do I say here ?
How do I do it ? &quot;
We don &apos;t have a <unk> film .
We &apos;re going to give it a little <unk> . Don &apos;t turn it around .
And all of the think of the Titanic and &quot; Avatar &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and had me of the <unk> on a <unk> on the strand .
I found all the films , these <unk> , for a very little publiek .
Not <unk> , no credit , no money .
You know , you know , you want to be the <unk> -- and the oceaan is the <unk> environment , which is , you know , you know , it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> connection , and for the rare verbinding , which is , of course , as a tiny groep of <unk> .
And we &apos;ve been doing all these things with just 10 tot 12 of 12 people who have been on these days . And then we were two of three maanden on the road .
And in this community , you can find that , that &apos;s the allerbelangrijkste thing that the person is going to be <unk> , because you have a job <unk> .
When you go to a country and tell you , &quot; We said , &quot; We said , &quot; Well , we can do it , the <unk> , and all the <unk> , and that &apos;s the same thing , the human <unk> , when you can &apos;t speak . &quot;
A connection , a <unk> respect .
And as I said , &quot; Avatar &quot; my film , &quot; Avatar &quot; , I used to put up my <unk> , and I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , men &apos;s team respect to the respect .
And this is the same thing .
So I went to a little team on <unk> terrein . We had a little bit of &quot; Avatar &quot; by a new technology die we have .
<unk> .
It &apos;s a huge <unk> .
And we were going to have a <unk> of four days .
And this is what my film is veranderd .
And we had the <unk> of people who said , well , we had these <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And for me , it was a <unk> manier , my job job , the real time , which is <unk> .
So what can we put out of all the time ?
So what we &apos;ve learned ?
I think the second one is the same .
It &apos;s the machtigste human .
So our hearts is a force that can actually do a reality .
and that person &apos;s <unk> is belangrijker as the <unk> of the world .
And to me , &quot; You know what I &apos;m saying is &quot; Give me a advies over here . &quot;
And I &apos;m saying , &quot; Don &apos;t give you a <unk> .
You know , there &apos;s another thing for you . Don &apos;t you ask for jezelf , not to jezelf .
So NASA has a <unk> : &quot; Never mind . &quot;
But in the art , we need not to be <unk> a alternatief , want it &apos;s <unk> .
No matter no matter what the <unk> is , you were not <unk> .
You need to be <unk> .
And it &apos;s the gedachte dat I &apos;m talking about . <unk> is a alternatief , not a alternatief , bang .
Als ik vandaag een dag wil maken , is het in ieder geval de som van de data die we consumeren , groter is dan de som van hun bits and in plaats van een <unk> te vinden dat we over nadenken over hoe we informatie kunnen gebruiken , zodat we kunnen nadenken over hoe we informatie kunnen gebruiken , zodat het niet echt is .
So we see here is an <unk> <unk> .
So , this programma , it &apos;s a little experiment .
It &apos;s <unk> , and what I can do is the <unk> and <unk> , is that I can be able to <unk> .
and I can see a different patroon .
And it &apos;s because in the <unk> here they are <unk> here , and they are <unk> .
So we can take a step back and we set up the data back and see that <unk> and kanker that are <unk> , but not every .
And when we look forward and we &apos;re 40 years old , we &apos;re 40 years old , of course , we can see that crashes in people who are <unk> .
And if <unk> can tell you , it &apos;s true for people .
And also , you can see that the <unk> of information and data is very <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And if we can do this for data , why not for content , right ?
So what we &apos;ve done here is the <unk> of any single one of them .
All right . It &apos;s all online .
You know , I &apos;m going to test them in my talk into my talk .
<unk> them in a decennium .
In a <unk> world .
You can jump into a different version .
So if I look at this here , I &apos;m seeing the atleet die you see in the output and those sporten .
I &apos;m a <unk> Armstrong named <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> .
And now , I &apos;m thinking , &quot; Okay , I &apos;m thinking , &quot; OK , if I &apos;m thinking of the question of <unk> ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to put a step back and forth .
I &apos;m looking at Greg <unk> .
And so what I &apos;m saying is , you know , if you &apos;re looking at this type of information , <unk> , breder , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , whatever it is .
A little bit , it &apos;s a little bit different .
And it &apos;s a <unk> and we think it &apos;s the type of , and we can be known as information .
Now , I &apos;m going to talk to you a little bit about it .
And what we &apos;ve done is , we &apos;ve <unk> each of them and we &apos;re <unk> them into a little bit .
So we have a little bit of a <unk> <unk> and a symbool for them .
I &apos;m just showing up the top 500 of the <unk> .
But in this particular case , we can do a heleboel things .
So let &apos;s say a little bit about the human rights , who &apos;s on Wikipedia .
So I &apos;m going to talk over here .
After I first , I think I &apos;m <unk> , I believe that the <unk> , which is the <unk> of Time <unk> .
And this is really belangrijk , want this is a belief that &apos;s not <unk> in a single <unk> .
And it &apos;s only to recognize when you go back and forth .
<unk> on some of these samenvattingen , I can tell you what I call the Time <unk> .
And if I think all of these topics I think of you , I believe that the meerderheid of them is <unk> . Some of them are out of the world .
And interestingly , Bono has a TED Prize .
So now we can jump up here and see the TED Prize .
So we &apos;re surfing the first thing as well as it does , as well as it does , not just a web , it &apos;s much abstract .
And what I &apos;m talking about is a little bit of a little verrassing .
I &apos;m just showing you the New York Times .
<unk> , die applicatie -- Ik wil het niet noemen ; het is echt geen browser , maar je kunt websites bekijken -- en we brengen dit <unk> naar elke website .
I can put a step back and forth .
And it &apos;s because it &apos;s important , because you can see any of these websites , of course , of websites and all of them .
I can see in my tracks in a very long way .
So here &apos;s the stand of the world .
and I can see everything I &apos;ve seen today , again .
And then , once again , I can look at a step back and look at everything , I can look at my <unk> . And I &apos;m looking at the <unk> of my <unk> . So I &apos;m looking at <unk> , here of Live Labs .
And of here , I can go back and look at them .
It &apos;s a metafoor die all the time is , and each time you will , and every time you turn the sum of the <unk> .
At the moment , in the world , we think data is <unk> .
We have the <unk> of the <unk> .
We have the word of information .
And what , if we could see this sort of view and the Internet on the head , so we &apos;re not going to have any of the rest of the time , is going to be <unk> of all sorts of things , and we can recognize that of the rest of the different things .
So if we can do this , the <unk> <unk> , maybe a new source of information .
And in the process , it &apos;s not only moving into information , we can use it .
And then we can find our knowledge , maybe we can have <unk> .
And I &apos;m talking about , thank you .
Now , each one can talk about happiness .
I &apos;ve had some of the people who have been put out of those items , who were gepubliceerd in the last five years , and we gave them over 40 years , and it &apos;s a lot more .
So , it &apos;s a huge golf player in the <unk> of happiness .
It &apos;s a big deal .
Everyone would be happy .
But despite all of all of this , of course , it &apos;s some of the <unk> <unk> , which is , of course , we can think of it as well as we think about happiness .
And my talk today is , I &apos;m going to be <unk> by this clever <unk> .
And it &apos;s <unk> by <unk> who think about your own happiness , and we think of scientists who think about happiness , as well as anyone else .
So the first of the <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> .
And so , it turns out that we don &apos;t really be curious about it , because we &apos;re putting it on many different ways .
I think , I think it &apos;s some of the truth that we could do , but in the big and talk , it &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to be <unk> , and we have it , we need to think of welzijn .
So the second thing is an <unk> experience and <unk> : In fact , it &apos;s what they &apos;re like in the <unk> of his lives and gelukkig over his lives .
And these are two very different concepten , and they are both <unk> in the <unk> .
And the number one is the <unk> , and it &apos;s the easy feit dat we can &apos;t think of any of the possibility , the welzijn changes , without <unk> .
I &apos;m my , right ?
We don &apos;t have a pad to get it .
Now , I &apos;m going to start with a case of somebody who had a <unk> , one of my colleges , who wrote a story . And there said , there would be a <unk> , and it &apos;s absolutely wonderful muziek , and at the end of the shot , it was a <unk> <unk> geluid .
And then there &apos;s a very , very emotional , which has been <unk> all the <unk> .
But it didn &apos;t .
And what they were called the <unk> of the experience .
There had the experience .
There had 20 seconds <unk> .
You don &apos;t <unk> , because there was a herinnering that was <unk> was <unk> , and the herinnering was everything , had all the time , had <unk> .
And what we &apos;re saying is , we can think of ourselves and think about other people in the <unk> of the zintuigen .
So , it &apos;s a <unk> , which is in the moment and in the moment , in the moment , in the world , in the same way , is , in fact , that &apos;s what the time is .
And it &apos;s the <unk> , that the arts <unk> -- you know , you know , when the arts says , &quot; Okay ? &quot;
And then , it &apos;s a <unk> , and the <unk> , is this : the <unk> and the geschiedenis of our lives , and it &apos;s the case that the arts <unk> is : &quot; Who is the door of the <unk> ? &quot; &quot; Who you &apos;ve been <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Who was your trip to <unk> ? &quot;
And these are two very different options , <unk> and <unk> , and both of the rest of the <unk> of the <unk> .
So , that <unk> is a verhalenverteller .
And it turns out to be the same thing as we &apos;re looking at our understanding -- it turns out .
We don &apos;t talk about the stories , when we &apos;re in the <unk> .
And our facial expression tells us , which is , of course , we &apos;ve been <unk> , is a verhaal .
And let &apos;s start with a example .
He &apos;s a <unk> study .
It &apos;s true of actual patients who have been <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . It &apos;s not a little <unk> , but she &apos;s been <unk> as this experiment in the &apos; 90s .
They were sending all the 60 seconden over to them .
And here are two of them . They are their records .
And you were asking , &quot; How many of them did you have more geleden ? &quot;
And it &apos;s a very simple question .
Patient B has no more geleden . His <unk> was a long time , and every minute of pijn , that had a patiënt A had a patiënt -- and it &apos;s more .
But here &apos;s another one of them , &quot; Who very thought of those who were <unk> ? &quot;
And here &apos;s a surprise .
And the surprise is that the patient A would have a great case of <unk> as a patient B.
And those of the <unk> were different , and because it &apos;s a very , very different part of the history .
And of course , of course , not the <unk> of them , but one of them is great , but one of them is the same , but one of them is pretty <unk> as those others .
And those who were <unk> is the case of the pijn on the bottom . It &apos;s a <unk> .
So what do we know ?
Because we asked these people when they asked them , and then we said , &quot; Who are <unk> all the time ? &quot;
and she was a great thing for A as well as B in the <unk> .
So , it &apos;s a direct conflict between the <unk> and the <unk> zelf .
So , of course , the <unk> himself had a <unk> time .
So , what you could do with the patient A could be done in the same way , and we &apos;re doing it , you know , you know , you know , you might be <unk> by the <unk> of a <unk> A <unk> by the <unk> of a <unk> .
And it &apos;s going to be <unk> , but it &apos;s just a little bit of a little bit , as well as .
And if you do a couple of seconds , you &apos;ve given a couple of seconds away , that <unk> is A good thing for your own sake , and you have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
Does it reflect a sentence ?
And it &apos;s true for those of those who are <unk> , and we &apos;re also , as well as the stories we &apos;re invented .
So , of course , a story of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> are very , very , very relevant and in this case .
Well , that <unk> is constantly alive .
And it &apos;s a bit of the <unk> , one of the others .
And you ask , &quot; What does it happen ?
And that &apos;s very simpel . You are lost .
Ik bedoel , de meeste momenten van ons leven -- en ik heb het uitgerekend -- u weet wel , that psychological <unk> is as ongeveer 600 seconden .
Those of them were completely <unk> by <unk> .
And yet , you know , you know , you know what they need to do is think of it , in the end , in the end of the day .
And it &apos;s that there &apos;s a eindige hulpbron die we &apos;re growing in the world .
And who we think it would be <unk> , but it &apos;s not that the history of the <unk> for us .
So we have the <unk> and <unk> and they are very different .
That &apos;s the great difference between them is the <unk> .
From the <unk> , for instance , when you have a vakantie and the second week , net as well as the first one , is the <unk> vakantie as the <unk> vakantie .
So does it work with not the <unk> zelf .
So , for example , a <unk> day is not a <unk> vakantie as much as the <unk> vakantie , want because it &apos;s not a new <unk> .
You know that geschiedenis is not gewijzigd .
And now , in the same way , the critical variabele , which is , of course , is different <unk> as well as a <unk> .
So , the <unk> is more likely to be <unk> and <unk> .
And it &apos;s in the case of the <unk> , want when you have a patiënt , we had two <unk> in the number of different chirurgen and besluit , die , die kiest , die kiest , is the one who &apos;s going to be <unk> , which is the one who &apos;s been <unk> .
The <unk> can &apos;t have stem in the same .
We don &apos;t do it . We &apos;re not going to do anything .
And if we think about those toekomst , we don &apos;t think of our toekomst as a person .
We think about our toekomst as <unk> .
And then you can see , you know , you know , you know , if some of the <unk> of <unk> , and you can think of the <unk> , and you can think of the <unk> , as a one , which is the <unk> of <unk> , which is not nodig .
And what I &apos;m saying is that when we &apos;re going to do a lot of the time , we &apos;re <unk> the case , we are <unk> in the services of the <unk> .
And it &apos;s a little bit <unk> , I think .
So , who are we <unk> by our experience ?
This is one of the verklaringen , who &apos;s going to be responsible for the <unk> .
And then , I think , I think , I think of a couple of years we &apos;ve been doing a couple of years from Antarctica , it &apos;s not very much the best <unk> die I had to do .
And I &apos;m sure of my herinnering on this <unk> journey , I would say about 25 seconds in the last four years .
Now , if I had the map I had had the map in 600 , I had a half of them .
Well , it &apos;s drie weken , and it &apos;s only 350 .
That &apos;s a <unk> .
So , I can be a little bit very <unk> , you know , in some ways , I can have a <unk> of <unk> , but , if you &apos;re more likely to do it .
So I &apos;m thinking , I think you think about a <unk> .
So you ask their first vakantie , you know , you know , on the back of the <unk> of all your time , and you have a <unk> medicijn , so you have a <unk> medicijn , so that you don &apos;t remember .
You know , would you take one look at the second step ? And if you were going to give a different <unk> , a conflict tussen both of you , and you know , who you &apos;re looking at this conflict , and it &apos;s not obvious , want when you think of the time you think of , you know , of course , in the sense of thinking of how you think of as well as you think of , of course , in some of your minds .
So what we &apos;re trying to do is figure out , it &apos;s a problem , it &apos;s a problem , which is , of course , we have a keuze between both of them .
Well , those both of them are both <unk> of the <unk> .
There is two concepten of happiness die we can use , one per person .
So you can ask , who are gelukkig <unk> ?
And then you ask , &quot; Well , who are gelukkig who are <unk> in the <unk> ?
And they &apos;re all -- well , happiness is a best complex proces .
What are those of them who can be measured ?
And then , we have a very good experience of happiness as well as the time .
When you ask the <unk> , it &apos;s a different thing .
It doesn &apos;t mean , who &apos;s a person alive .
And it &apos;s about it , who &apos;s tevreden of the person , and <unk> it .
Very different .
Now , each of them , who &apos;s not different <unk> is the <unk> of happiness , and I &apos;ve been <unk> to be a fate of <unk> over welzijn , which is the <unk> long term .
And that onderscheid between the <unk> of happiness and the happiness of the <unk> self is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;ve <unk> those two <unk> .
And the Gallup Organization has a global poll , as well as a half miljoen people have been <unk> over their lives over their lives and over them .
In the last few years , we &apos;ve gone over to the <unk> of both of them .
And the main thing , we &apos;ve been learning , is I think it &apos;s really different .
You know , who knows , who &apos;s tevreden with your life is there , and they don &apos;t know about it , who &apos;s not a lot about it , who &apos;s still alive and vice versa .
Just to give you a sense of connection , which is <unk> .
So , what does it mean by a person , and you would say , oh , oh , his vader is <unk> , who &apos;s a <unk> person ?
So , you know , you know , you know about your afmeting , but it &apos;s a lot of onzekerheid .
You have a lot of onzekerheid .
And if I tell you , there &apos;s a chance of life as eight on a level of 10 <unk> , you have a lot of onzekerheid over here , who &apos;s gelukkig has been <unk> .
It &apos;s denser .
And we know about it , it &apos;s true of the <unk> .
We know that money is very relevant , doelen are very relevant .
We know , we know that happiness is especially <unk> by people who we love to spend time with people who we love .
It &apos;s other , but it &apos;s dominant .
So , as you know , if you ask the rise of both the same type of self , you are very different .
And the premise of this , I said , &quot; Well , we can &apos;t think we should be happy to be <unk> by welzijn .
It &apos;s a completely different term .
Now , a second , a different question , whether we can &apos;t think of thinking about happiness , is that we don &apos;t care about any of these things when we think about the lives and we live .
When you ask those simpele questions , who are happy who are in California are not going to be that correct .
And if you ask the question you think of people in California are more likely to be happy .
And what &apos;s happened is , when you think about the lives in California , you think of the difference between California and others , and of course , is , we say , in the <unk> .
And so , it turns out , it &apos;s not very relevant for the <unk> zelf , and it &apos;s not even very relevant for the <unk> zelf , which is not even very relevant for people .
And so , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some of the people would end up in California .
And the thing is , it &apos;s interesting , it &apos;s true of people who are in the <unk> , who are in the <unk> ,
So , your <unk> will not be gelukkiger .
We know .
But one thing is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , they think they &apos;re gelukkiger , want when they think about it , they think of it as <unk> in Ohio . And they were feeling that they were facing .
And it &apos;s very lastig to think about welzijn , and I hope , I &apos;m going to give you one idee , who &apos;s <unk> .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you .
So , if we had a couple of weken <unk> , I said , &quot; I mean , it &apos;s a very interesting resultaat , &quot;
Is it something that you can have time over ?
Daniel <unk> : Zeker .
Now , I think , the <unk> results that we have to find out in the Gallup survey is a getal that we &apos;re not expected .
We found this in the <unk> of <unk> .
And if we were to find ourselves , who can interact as well .
And so , it turns out , in a inkomen of 60,000 dollars in a inkomen , for example , and it &apos;s a very large steekproef of Americans , ongeveer 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representatieve steekproef , in a inkomen 600,000 dollars in a inkomen in 600,000 dollars .
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars per jaar is that they are <unk> , and they become more <unk> , you know .
So we get a perfect place .
And I see , I &apos;ve been watching platte pixels .
And what it does is , is , is to say , it &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> , but not a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we can &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
In the spirit of others , the <unk> zelf , you have another verhaal .
You earn more money you &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> .
CA : So Danny , in all the U.S . , in the <unk> of life , vrijheid , <unk> of <unk> .
And if people were going to take these <unk> , I agree , it seems all about all the time , all the time we &apos;re in <unk> and so forth .
Is it more likely to be the case of people who are in a <unk> <unk> who are going to be <unk> and <unk> over the beleid ?
DK : Well , I think , I think , I think it &apos;s erkenning for the <unk> of the <unk> .
That recognition will be <unk> in the United States , not a question , but in the Verenigd Koninkrijk , she &apos;s in others .
And those of them recognize that they think they need to think of happiness as they think of a <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you , and they are bespreken , of course , of course , <unk> of them , of course , of <unk> , of <unk> , we need to be <unk> .
Now , who you can see happiness is very different based on how you think of , who are thinking of , of course , of course , of course , thinking of yourself , of course .
And it changes the world , I think , in the komende years .
In the United States , <unk> man , the <unk> bevolking .
So , I think , in the next one , of course , in the next few years of national activism .
CA : So , it seems , of course , I think this thing , of course , is the <unk> politieke debat over the next few years .
Thank you so much .
Thank you , Danny <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and klimaat .
And it &apos;s been <unk> , because I believe , in the stichting , there &apos;s a lot of the world &apos;s population and <unk> , and we need to put all the time in the world , and we need to be able to provide the armste two of them .
But energy and klimaat is very relevant for these people , so we can , as well as anyone else on the planet .
And <unk> betekent , of course , is not going to be <unk> . We &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
It &apos;s got to <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> .
And so , of course , they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
And the <unk> is the <unk> .
And in fact , if you &apos;re only <unk> if any of the cost of the prijs is energy in the <unk> .
And the <unk> is <unk> .
In fact , it &apos;s called <unk> .
And that <unk> was the industriële Revolutie , and within the 20 years , it was a <unk> case in the <unk> , and we have the <unk> , <unk> , we can restore modern materialen and have a lot of stuff .
So now we are in a great world of elektriciteit in the world .
But then , if we &apos;re going to verlagen the prijs -- we &apos;re going to reduce the price -- we &apos;re going to put it in a different barrière .
CO2 drives the world and that vergelijking is very clear .
And what you call the <unk> CO2 , which is <unk> and <unk> has a very good effect . And effect on the back of the weather , and so , of course , the <unk> result is that those natuurlijke ecosystemen can &apos;t adapt to the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> , and all of them are <unk> .
Now , the sort of thing is that it &apos;s the contrast between a <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and as well as their effects are lying , but not very many .
And he &apos;s all <unk> over it , who are pretty <unk> . But they are very <unk> .
So I asked these <unk> : &quot; Are we going to be at the same time ? &quot;
Don &apos;t that half of them ? &quot;
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re saying is , at the end of the day , the temperatuur is moving .
So it &apos;s a big deal .
And it &apos;s different as we say , we have a 3,5 meter high trucks die in a <unk> truck are . You can put them back in them .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at here .
So we &apos;re going to put a <unk> <unk> , about 26 miljard ton .
Every one of them is about 20 ton . <unk> of poor countries , as a one .
At the age of five , each of them on the planet .
And we all of a sudden , of course , we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
And it &apos;s very close to it .
All of a sudden , of course , of course , is affecting different economische differences , and we need to export <unk> percent of energy emissions .
And this vergelijking has four points . A little bit of <unk> . You have this thing on the left -- CO2 -- it &apos;s going to be <unk> by the number of people who are going to be responsible for all of a sudden , and the number of people who are using all of a sudden , the <unk> power of all the work and the CO2 , which is per <unk> <unk> .
So what we &apos;re looking at is a factor of a factor of one factor and we &apos;re thinking about it .
And so , one of the reasons why one of the getallen is very close to zero .
Now , this is <unk> algebra , but we do it .
So we have the same .
Today &apos;s <unk> .
and it looks at nine miljard <unk> that is nine billion .
And if we do very well with the current vaccins , the <unk> and <unk> , we may be 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a <unk> .
The number one factor that we use .
It &apos;s all the time that we &apos;re living , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
And this is very good stuff and <unk> , and all of the services that are present in the world .
It &apos;s great , it &apos;s <unk> .
In the world of the world , in the top of the world , we might be <unk> and <unk> , but in the age of each year , each of the cost of each year is increasing and so much more like verdubbelen , which is the cost of services .
So here we have a very <unk> facility . Is it going to be <unk> ?
And these people didn &apos;t have them , but they &apos;re going to read their <unk> as well .
Now , in terms of efficiëntie , the E , it &apos;s a good news .
We have something .
And according to some of the different output in the <unk> , by other <unk> , by the way , there &apos;s a lot of services that are <unk> , and there are a lot of services die you can dramatically <unk> , <unk> : <unk> : 50.000 -- <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> ?
Some of these services are 90 percent .
In others , of course , <unk> , <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> , of <unk> , is the <unk> of mass <unk> .
And at all .
But at the first of all , we have been <unk> by 26 miljard years , and we went to <unk> 13 miljard ton . And it &apos;s not <unk> !
So what we &apos;re looking at is the <unk> factor -- and this will be a <unk> -- it &apos;s the fate of CO2 , which is going to be <unk> .
And the question is , of course you can do it .
When you &apos;re <unk> kolen .
When you &apos;re <unk> aardgas , &quot; Oh .
Fast all of a <unk> world today for <unk> CO2 , except for hernieuwbare energy and <unk> .
So what we need to do is we have a different system .
We need <unk> .
And if I look at the term , I &apos;m not the onmogelijke .
So the <unk> is a <unk> . The PC is a <unk> .
And the Internet and the services is an <unk> .
And those of us here who have been <unk> here has been <unk> .
So , in fact , it &apos;s not <unk> , that man will have a miracle of <unk> .
In fact , you are not only sitting in front of them .
In this case , we should be <unk> , and we have a <unk> in a very short time .
So I said , who can I do it ?
So if it &apos;s a natural <unk> , some of the people who are <unk> ?
And I remember at the same time , if I had the mug of my <unk> , and I could do these things .
And that was the idea for them , you know , you know , you know , you know , people who live with muggen .
So I think this was a big deal .
I would see that the <unk> of <unk> my <unk> bijdrage would be here .
Here &apos;s some of the natural <unk> .
You have me been <unk> , they don &apos;t have them <unk> .
So , so we can do all of these <unk> , but they don &apos;t care .
So we &apos;ve got the capability , of course , of some of them who are looking at some of them and <unk> . And then , of course , many of them are <unk> . And then , of course , all of a sudden , of course , all of a sudden , of course , in those many ways .
I have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And so this might be a little bit more <unk> and if they &apos;re better as well as I &apos;m doing , it &apos;s great , but my <unk> , but we &apos;re not going to be able to do all of them .
So what we &apos;re looking at is the <unk> fossiele brandstoffen , for example , moving kolen from steenkool ,
And what you need to do is <unk> , but it &apos;s not . You know all of the CO2 , it &apos;s all of the CO2 emissions by the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , and so on board , and so on .
And it &apos;s some of the <unk> die you see in a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but 100 percent is going to be very lastig . And one of the <unk> of CO2 is a big deal . But this is a big deal .
How will it be ?
How do we stand out of any of the rest of the world , could be a little bit of <unk> as any type of <unk> and others ?
It &apos;s a volume .
And this is a tough time .
Next , <unk> .
And these have three great problems . These cost , especially in <unk> countries . And the question of is , of course , is not going to be able to be able to be <unk> , for the people who don &apos;t use it , is not <unk> by the <unk> .
You know what ?
Because there &apos;s not a big deal .
And those of people who are <unk> . <unk> : 10 : 20,000 -- <unk> : 10 : 25,000 and three very moeilijke problemen , who may be solved .
Three very moeilijke problemen , who may be to be solved .
And those two of them have been the last five .
It &apos;s the <unk> of energy , who are <unk> .
And then , hoewel it -- hoewel it is cool , they have some <unk> .
So one is the <unk> , which is dramatically smaller as <unk> .
And it &apos;s <unk> , you know , you know of <unk> , it &apos;s more <unk> as a normal power plant .
And then , of course , of course , <unk> these <unk> .
The zon doesn &apos;t seem to be all the time , it doesn &apos;t seem to be any of the same time , and the wind is not always .
So , of course , if you &apos;re based on whether you &apos;re based on whether you have a pad , that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing as well .
So here &apos;s a big deal . We have a lot of <unk> . And if we say , &quot; Well , if you say , that &apos;s energy in the country , you don &apos;t need to be that technology , you need to be <unk> , you need to be <unk> .
And it &apos;s <unk> .
And of course , I &apos;m going to show you all the <unk> of batterijen , I think of all the type of batterijen , Computer , computer , mobieltjes , <unk> , and I &apos;ve met the massa of electronic power , die in the world are <unk> .
So what we &apos;re going to do here is , we &apos;ve got a huge <unk> , something that &apos;s a factor 100 more important , if those requirements are at the time .
It &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s not so <unk> .
And it &apos;s true , when you &apos;ve been working , we have 20 percent -- 30 percent of the <unk> .
When you &apos;re talking about 100 percent and a half <unk> .
So now we &apos;re going to ask , &quot; What is the correct ?
So a &quot; Manhattan Project ? &quot; who are at the time ?
And what we need is a lot of companies die hieraan already werken .
In each of these days , we can do 100 people .
And you have to say , &quot; Oh , yeah . &quot;
And I think , in the TED community , it &apos;s a lot of them .
Bill Gross has a couple of companies , as well as one of them called <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> in business companies who have wonderful things and interesting , and I &apos;m trying to do it .
Nathan <unk> and I financieren a bedrijf , perhaps , perhaps , <unk> the <unk> .
And it &apos;s some of the <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , water .
And the modern history came along with a period of time , and it &apos;s not surprising , that some of the great concepten <unk> .
And the <unk> system betekent , in the middle of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we see the 99 percent <unk> .
And it &apos;s a really sad idea .
But there had been a long time to be a long time , but you could not be <unk> of <unk> , but the modern supercomputer is <unk> , and then you can see : &quot; Yes ! Met the juiste <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
And if you drive the 99 percent , it &apos;s <unk> a lot more .
In fact , you are <unk> the <unk> , and you can see the <unk> of today as <unk> .
In the middle of the mind , you are <unk> .
So the uranium uses <unk> , which is a little bit of a kaars .
And you see , you know , there &apos;s a map , vaak as &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And the lost <unk> .
Here &apos;s a map of a <unk> in Kentucky .
It &apos;s the <unk> , which is the 99 percent . You &apos;ve been <unk> , <unk> uranium .
And the <unk> that we have is 100 years old .
And then , if you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , you have enough brandstof for the rest of the world .
So there &apos;s a couple of uitdagingen , but it &apos;s some of the uitdagingen , but we &apos;re talking about a certain number of concepten die we need .
So we think of it as we should meet our success .
So who should be in the <unk> ?
And then we &apos;re going to focus on the target that we need to do and then reason over the <unk> .
Well , of course , there are a lot of people who are going to be <unk> by 2050 .
And it &apos;s really important to be .
And those of the rest of the 20 percent in poor countries , and again , and again , and it &apos;s a little bit of business . And I &apos;m hoping to be <unk> and cement .
So at the age of 80 percent , the world of countries , of countries who are in China , their <unk> .
And the other thing is , of course , of course , we can use the <unk> technology , of course , of course , in all of these countries , and we &apos;re in the process of the rest of them .
It &apos;s great .
This is a <unk> .
So if we &apos;re going to be <unk> , who should be in 2020 ?
It would be the same thing .
So we &apos;re going to use that <unk> , we &apos;re going to reduce the cost . So we are more <unk> , which is <unk> that <unk> is the <unk> .
But the second thing is , for those of those things we &apos;re doing , we don &apos;t have all the time of the big <unk> , of all of a little bit , of which is , of course , as well as the others , which is the same as the other , which is the <unk> of the innovatie .
And the number of the coral reefs we can see , and we can meet : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
There &apos;s a great film over here .
So , Al Gore &apos;s book , &quot; We have these letters &quot; and David <unk> &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . &quot;
And you know , you know , you know , and we &apos;re going to put a space over and over the course of the world , want this is what we &apos;re doing .
There are some of them .
It &apos;s a wens .
A very <unk> wens is that we &apos;re starting to uitvinden this technology .
And if you give me a wens for the next 50 years , I could give the president , a vaccin , and it &apos;s like , of course , of course , of course , of course , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
This is the biggest effect .
And if we &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> people in the United States and China , between poor and <unk> and fast all of all the life of two miljard years .
So what do we do ?
So for some of them , I &apos;m <unk> ?
We need to be more <unk> .
When countries are <unk> , they &apos;re not going to be there over the CO2 .
You know , you would be <unk> over the <unk> , and you were geschokt of the <unk> <unk> , which were responsible for the problem .
We need <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
We need the value .
We need to be different <unk> and <unk> , and all the things that were done by the world .
And it &apos;s a great wens , but I think we can do it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
So , thank you . Just to be <unk> a little bit more to understand -- <unk> , can be our mind of the <unk> ?
Bill Gates : So , of course , we &apos;ve had a long time to put all the time in a supercomputer , we have a couple of 10 miljoen . And if we were able to test them in a very <unk> reactor , and if we were able to test our materials in a very <unk> reactor , we have to be able to be able to get all the time in the <unk> miljoen .
And the moeilijke step is the construction of the first <unk> , again , again , again , the <unk> and the place is the first thing .
And as the first thing , when the first thing goes out of life , it &apos;s all right , it &apos;s all right , want the <unk> is , as well as we know .
CA : So , it &apos;s <unk> : It &apos;s <unk> in the middle of the ground .
BG : Right . So now , now , the reactor is <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of people and all of a sudden , and all of a sudden , the thing that you can do it .
When you have a very efficient brandstof , you can do it for 60 years -- you know what you &apos;re going to do with a <unk> -- you can stick out .
And it turns out and brand 60 years and it &apos;s done .
CA : So , a <unk> , which is what &apos;s going to be <unk> .
BG : Yes . Now , it &apos;s what he &apos;s doing : You can put it -- it &apos;s a lot less <unk> with this type of <unk> -- you take it and <unk> it in the next reactor and <unk> .
And we &apos;re starting to take the <unk> , which is , of course , in the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s our <unk> .
Now , this is the case of the reactors , it &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in the <unk> and <unk> dramatically in this process .
CA : So , but when you &apos;ve seen the human beings in the world over
So , is the great thing , is the great thing ?
BG : We &apos;re not going to be <unk> and er is veel more interesting data for everything called &quot; <unk> &quot; in the Morning .
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the Fransen and Japan had something in that .
This is a different version of one .
And it &apos;s a really important step , but it &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> reactor and some of them have been created by a rapid reactor .
CA : So , in your mind , as you know , as a result of the time , in the world of life ?
BG : So we have one of these <unk> , <unk> , which is very expensive , we have 20 years old and 20 years to the <unk> .
And it &apos;s all the <unk> die us <unk> is the <unk> , which we need to do .
And you know , <unk> , if everything is <unk> and it &apos;s a great wens , it might be <unk> .
And so now , it &apos;s now , in fact , there are now tientallen organizations , and we need honderden data , and we can see if their differences are going to be <unk> , <unk> .
and it would be best , want you could use a <unk> .
In any case , we have a problem .
CA : So the big number of the number of doorbraken , is this great thing :
BG : A <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s not the <unk> , but it &apos;s the power of power .
And in the <unk> sector , the other thing is ,
You know , we don &apos;t know about their work as well as this , but it &apos;s the <unk> methode .
So , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which seems to be <unk> , but maybe we can say it .
And so , of course , it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s best to be <unk> a miljoen keer zoveel energie -- we can say , &quot; Well , if you can do the <unk> of the problem , and that is voornamelijk that photosynthesis and the cost is , of course , is the <unk> and the cost is , of all of a sudden .
CA : So if it &apos;s not <unk> , then ?
Should we be <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
BG : When you &apos;re in the situation , it &apos;s as well you have to have a hartaanval . You know what ?
So , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> die <unk> , which is , of course , we &apos;ve been thinking about the opwarming of the world , we have 20 of 30 years to <unk> .
This is a <unk> .
We don &apos;t need it .
There &apos;s a couple of people who don &apos;t want to be on the <unk> because you might want to work in the same way . You know , you know , you know that one of them is the <unk> .
And I &apos;m not saying , of course , it &apos;s slim , as you know the subject of interest , but it &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> over here .
CA : Do you have some of them , could you probably ?
BG : Yeah , leader in the very few <unk> .
And those of them , those studies , are very little .
Does it matter to them , is to be able to do those who have the same thing ?
And it &apos;s very , very few , very few things they can tell you .
So , the <unk> is net als AIDS .
So you power the fact that it &apos;s a little bit later .
And this is the idea , now , if you have all of these <unk> problems , in something , whether it &apos;s been <unk> -- and that &apos;s where the market is not <unk> . And the IPCC Report is not <unk> . And the IPCC Report is not <unk> .
That &apos;s what we need to do .
But my dream here is , dat , als we economisch <unk> , and the same thing is , the more powerful , say , &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not sure that it &apos;s not <unk> , but I &apos;m sure , want it &apos;s goedkoper to me , but I &apos;m sure , want it &apos;s goedkoper to do . &quot;
CA : And it &apos;s your best argument in the <unk> <unk> argument , that when you put all the time and energy on the <unk> , all the others that lead to malaria , the <unk> of malaria and so forth , is that it &apos;s a domme verspilling in control of <unk> , and so on .
BG : Well , that &apos;s the actual current uitgaven -- we &apos;re saying that the United States is 10 miljard per century if they do today -- it &apos;s not so dramatic .
In contrast , others should not lead .
You know , if you go to the Big Bang , and here can be <unk> people , if you have anything , it &apos;s not <unk> , and we &apos;ve been doing it .
And it &apos;s because it &apos;s because it &apos;s just a <unk> and fund , it &apos;s not the <unk> . I think we &apos;re more <unk> .
As the <unk> , the man will have a very high <unk> , but only those <unk> .
I &apos;m sure each of us could spend a half of our energy in the world without <unk> .
And for those long , we have a ramp .
and then <unk> .
So the new <unk> is now : &quot; Well , why does it work out of research ? &quot;
And there &apos;s still , for example , for the last few years , but there is a <unk> connection , but there is , there is a very , very , very , very <unk> number .
And it &apos;s a <unk> die I do .
It &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
CA : Bill , I think , I think of all of all the people here , if I say , &quot; You know what your wens is . &quot;
BG : Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about some of the few years ago as I wrote a artikel over the Pentagon .
I found my <unk> <unk> , but I was running out of the <unk> of the <unk> , and I realized that I &apos;m not going to be in my <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
I &apos;m reading you .
&quot; <unk> &quot; , <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> en zwak .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
And I went on a day with a vriend I found out of <unk> , and we were <unk> , so <unk> , but I was only saying , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and I couldn &apos;t do anything more <unk> , and I would stop reading them and take me out of the <unk> <unk> .
Well , it &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> <unk> . And I thought that the output should have a little bit .
But this was a version of the back in the early &apos; 80s , when I went back to the junior <unk> , and I began to put my <unk> in the back of my time .
And God , thank you .
I &apos;m going to take a <unk> , I was born in a world who could be as much as one person in the <unk> of their lives , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
So I asked the <unk> of 2009 , and I would say , well , I think it &apos;s a <unk> subject .
Here is the <unk> versie of this <unk> .
<unk> is not a big deal .
In most of the world , I believe that both of them were &quot; Near <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot; gezond . &quot;
But it &apos;s not just the case .
And we &apos;re talking about it over those people die we love .
It &apos;s over the <unk> , who are <unk> in the same way , and who we have .
We can see our minds and our thinking and who we see those world and those of us .
Many <unk> of cities , as well as the Grieken and the <unk> , who were really geloofd , is saying , &quot; Well , it &apos;s a <unk> force , because it &apos;s <unk> .
So , we are <unk> -- a <unk> person , of course , of a <unk> person ?
Just all of them have been <unk> as kind of <unk> , it would be <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> them .
Is it not going to be <unk> ?
A person who was opening up with me in front of my day , my <unk> <unk> . <unk> Institute in <unk> .
There &apos;s Dr . <unk> . A <unk> , whose name is , who , who could not be <unk> . There &apos;s always called Dr . <unk> .
And then , Dr . <unk> had always been <unk> , and was the job of being <unk> .
I found that moment , I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in that ziekenhuis .
And I said , &quot; I would love to be oneindig , &quot; so many of them were <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in various kleuren -- you know what I call my <unk> .
You ask me , I &apos;ve had a little bit of <unk> kind of <unk> with Dr . <unk> and so we &apos;ve been trying to stop doing these oefeningen .
And a day of a day , I went to see some of my oefeningen -- and I said , &quot; Wow , &quot; and I said , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you know , and I said , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you have a <unk> , <unk> and jong meisje , &quot;
and then you add a hundred dollars . &quot;
Het was een makkelijke trick van Dr . <unk> , zodat ik oefeningen doe die ik niet wou maken , met het vooruitzicht dat een <unk> meisje in de tweede verdieping was . Maar hij heeft me in staat om mijn dagelijkse <unk> te zien met nieuwe ogen .
And I &apos;m asking myself , who are very good at the moment of my mind as I think of as strong and <unk> my <unk> of my <unk> , and I could see me as a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> person .
This is just a case of many , who can be <unk> in <unk> that can be <unk> .
But who &apos;s all <unk> examples of the <unk> of <unk> , we can &apos;t ask our language , we &apos;re not talking about all the people we would ever have .
And our understanding of the <unk> of the <unk> , which is , in many cases , in the case of a technological event .
And as I can tell you , I can tell you , I mean , my benen , who can tell me , is my legs , who are <unk> by <unk> , <unk> of Titan and <unk> by <unk> lichamen , who have <unk> their ability to use and over the limits die you have , in the same way , not over Social <unk> .
and over the world of over the world , of course , they are their own .
And now , of course , the technological verandering can tell you , want every single one of them has been on the other waarheid , though , is that every mens of society has been <unk> and very <unk> , and we can be <unk> , and that &apos;s the human ability , to be <unk> .
De menselijke vaardigheid of een -- it is een interessant verhaal , want mensen zijn me voortdurend gebeten om te vertellen hoe ik met <unk> <unk> ben en ik zal jullie iets vertellen : deze zin heeft voor me , en ik ben altijd erg ongemakkelijk geweest door de vragen waarom .
And this is the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> by the idee , which is , of course , of course , of course , is going to be <unk> , without any of the <unk> ervaring , as well as my life as well as my own life .
But the truth is , we are changing . We are , of course , we can of them ,
And I think it &apos;s okay .
<unk> is no obstakel . We need to be <unk> to our lives .
<unk> of our lives .
And I &apos;m very <unk> as my schaduw .
Sometimes I think there is very , very close , but there &apos;s a lot of it .
And I &apos;m not sure that the impact of the impact of the <unk> of a <unk> .
It &apos;s in the <unk> and the uitdagingen , and it &apos;s only <unk> and every single one of them .
We are not only verantwoordelijk that people who we love , they &apos;re not going to be <unk> , but they &apos;re also invited to get out of them .
And we &apos;re not <unk> our kids at the time , if we don &apos;t know them .
You need to be distinct two <unk> , in the one that we are in charge of the general , <unk> and others , of course .
And of course , to be honest , the only one and <unk> handicap , I said , is that the world would always tell me , it &apos;s all the way in the world .
In our life , those of us who are facing people who are lying to them , and they have them , they have the <unk> of their global history , of one more than one of the more than one of them .
So , maybe the <unk> concept , it &apos;s only <unk> in a <unk> , and who we do is fix every single one of them , for each one of them .
And if we don &apos;t behandelen <unk> , and not all of the world , and not all of the powers and our minds and recognize , we can put it together , we can put it together .
We <unk> a person die our society has .
So we &apos;re looking at the <unk> of the <unk> and we focus on all the society .
But the <unk> , but we are in the <unk> of <unk> and our great <unk> .
We should not be <unk> of <unk> of <unk> , we were not trying to , we &apos;re not trying to , or we &apos;re not trying to get them out of the <unk> .
And of course , I think we can ask me to ask , &quot; We don &apos;t necessarily need to be <unk> , but we &apos;re open them up , &quot; so we &apos;re going to <unk> them to be <unk> , and maybe even <unk> .
And then we can do it , <unk> as some of them , <unk> and <unk> , and we can find ourselves out of their own <unk> .
In that year , we are at the 200 . verjaardag of Charles Darwin and if there &apos;s 150 years ago over evolutie , Darwin , in my ogen , in my ogen , in a very strong mind .
I &apos;m so <unk> : not the sheer <unk> of the <unk> , and not the <unk> of its own , but , of course , of course , of course .
And of course , of course , <unk> creativiteit .
We don &apos;t just know of Darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people , of course , is <unk> and <unk> , by <unk> , by conflict of its own mind .
And , again , of course , on the face of the world .
And we can tell us , if we were <unk> , we are <unk> .
So , of course , the sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a gevoel for our power .
We can give us something .
We can have a different appreciation of the time .
So we can see that we can see <unk> .
<unk> is a difference that we &apos;re not <unk> .
I believe , the grootste schade die we have is <unk> , is to geloven dat we normal are .
Are you serious ?
He &apos;s not .
It &apos;s <unk> . The <unk> . But not normal . You know , of course , who &apos;s really known to be ?
I don &apos;t think .
Of course , it would be great , if we &apos;re the model of the <unk> of a different type of , of the <unk> of the <unk> . So we can <unk> them . So we can put those forces of a lot together , and we &apos;re uitnodigen them , and we &apos;re willing to invite them to them , and we are in the <unk> .
<unk> has found that we have people who have the support of our society of our society , <unk> and <unk> .
And we can see that , of course , is the infectious diseases for 60,000 years old people and people who have lived out of <unk> of <unk> <unk> and so on , because the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
They were not known as <unk> and <unk> ; they were <unk> as well and <unk> .
So I went to a couple of years ago in the town die I was opgegroeid in a <unk> in the &quot; Red Zone &quot; in the noordoosten of Pennsylvania , and I was standing on the <unk> .
It was zomer and I had <unk> .
And I remember who says , &quot; After all , &quot; after not Aimee <unk> . &quot;
And I &apos;m <unk> , and I &apos;m not talking about it .
And I said , &quot; Pardon , yes , we know ? &quot;
And there said , &quot; Well , yeah , I don &apos;t think .
And if I looked at the first time , I &apos;m going to take you from the buik of your mama . &quot;
Oh , that .
And so , it &apos;s just done , it &apos;s done .
This was Dr . <unk> , a man die , of my mama , of my mama , because I was , &quot; Oh , very typical , op my verjaardag . &quot;
The arts had been <unk> by <unk> by my mama , and so I knew my ouders gave me the man who was in the world of me , not .
And because I was born without <unk> , and my left was <unk> , and I had a couple of tenen up on this , there was a couple of tenen over and over my feet .
And I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; You know what you didn &apos;t do , and not be <unk> as any of these kids , of course , who you could not have a <unk> of life .
Ik was echt opmerkelijk dat hij mijn hele kindertijd <unk> of , of of ik in een <unk> of een <unk> had -- of of ik een of mijn beurs was of of een van mijn <unk> <unk> , en hij gebruikte de <unk> , en hij gebruikte de <unk> om zijn studenten uit de <unk> Medical School te houden en de <unk> Medical School .
And there &apos;s this thing called the <unk> factor , the X factor of the <unk> .
It &apos;s not enough to be more honest than the matter of one factor of a <unk> .
And then , Dr . <unk> zei , &quot; I &apos;ve learned , &quot; I said , &quot; I &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t always remember anything else , and then just as well as any ondersteuning , &quot; I mean , kids have a lot of time .
Let &apos;s see , Dr . <unk> is <unk> .
And there seemed to be realized that those drugs were moving , and who are <unk> , two different things .
And what I &apos;ve learned in the time of time when they were 15 years old when I had been asked by 15 years of my <unk> of my <unk> and bot , I had no seconde <unk> .
I was very <unk> .
When you ask me today , I &apos;m not sure .
And it &apos;s true , <unk> I &apos;ve found out of my legs and not <unk> .
And so , of course , the same thing could be done , because I &apos;ve been facing a lot of people who were opening me in the walls of my day , in the face of them , or I was <unk> .
You see , it &apos;s really just a person who tells you , who can tell you how you can change your powers .
And if you can put it in your own , you can put your own , innerlijke krachten -- -- the menselijke geest is so <unk> -- if you &apos;re doing it , and for somebody in a moment at the moment is open a deur .
You ask them , they &apos;re going to open the deuren .
This is the truth of the <unk> , &quot; <unk> in the <unk> . &quot;
It means , in one , of course , in a <unk> .
Again , how do we want to be <unk> ?
In the 1960s , in the 1960s , in the U.K .
You call it &quot; <unk> <unk> in the United States . &quot;
These students were <unk> .
And the A student became more <unk> as well as well .
And then you have heard about a <unk> period of time called the &quot; <unk> &quot; which sounds : &quot; Very good . &quot; And they said , &quot; Hey , they were <unk> , &quot; they said , &quot; Hey , they were <unk> . &quot;
And of course , I &apos;m sorry to remember the person who said the <unk> , they were only enough .
and it &apos;s only three maanden later .
Just one of those who were still on school -- aside from the people who had the school <unk> .
In the case of the study , we were not <unk> .
And those docenten didn &apos;t tell you that something was veranderd .
And you said , &quot; Oh , those who were <unk> and is the <unk> and they were paying them . &quot;
And the only real handicap is a <unk> geest of mind , the <unk> is not <unk> . There &apos;s nothing more <unk> . There &apos;s nothing to do with the <unk> of our natural , <unk> <unk> and our <unk> .
And if we &apos;re going to do it , we &apos;re going to be able to do the <unk> of the human mind , and we &apos;re not going to be able to find ourselves , to be able to be happy , nieuwsgierig and <unk> , we &apos;re going to be making our own power .
When we have a mind of the world , we have a new reality of and new <unk> .
Ik wil eindigen met een gedicht , which is geschreven door een <unk> dichter in de 14e eeuw , en dat mijn vriend Jacques <unk> heeft verteld . En het gedicht is &quot; De god die ik ken : &quot; De god die ik ken , God kent God , niet de god van de god . &quot;
Kom out , <unk> . Thank you .
