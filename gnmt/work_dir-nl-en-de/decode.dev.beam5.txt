Last year , I was showing these two slides of the United States , which had been about the last three years , which had been about the size of the United States of America , with 40 percent <unk> .
But this actually <unk> the seriousness of this particular problem because it &apos;s not showing the <unk> of the ice .
In the North Atlantic in the North Atlantic , in a sense , the <unk> of our global <unk> are <unk> .
It takes out in winter and <unk> in the summer .
The next slide I &apos;m showing you is a <unk> version of what has happened over the last 25 years ,
The permanent ice is <unk> in red .
As you can see , take it out of <unk> .
That &apos;s the annual ice season during winter .
And it was <unk> in the summer .
The so-called permanent ice , five years or older , is almost like blood that comes from the body here .
In 25 years of this , it went from this to this .
And that &apos;s a problem because the frozen soil surrounding the <unk> <unk> <unk> and there &apos;s a very large amount of frozen carbon dioxide that when it gets <unk> , it turns out that microbes turn into methane .
<unk> with the total amount of energy in the atmosphere of the atmosphere , that could double if we were <unk> <unk> .
In some cubic lakes in Alaska , methane is methane .
Last winter , Professor <unk> Walter <unk> went to another team to another team to another <unk> .
<unk> ! It &apos;s OK . The question is , though we will be .
One reason is that this huge &quot; <unk> &quot; is melting up from north to north .
This is a <unk> .
But the <unk> is larger than ever .
This is the <unk> River in <unk> .
If you want to know what the sea level rises because it melts , it &apos;s the place where it gets into the sea .
These <unk> are quickly <unk> .
On the other hand , on the other side of the planet , at the South Pole , there &apos;s the largest <unk> on Earth .
Last month , scientists have found that the continent is now a negative <unk> .
More specifically , the ice was in the west of the South Pole very fast , particularly a few <unk> .
The whole continent is <unk> for six feet , just like Greenland .
In the Himalayas , the two of the largest predatory species , there are now new lakes that were still glaciers a few years ago .
Forty percent of the world &apos;s population is given half of its drinking water .
In the Andes , this <unk> is the source of drinking water for this city .
There are more banks now .
But when they disappear , the drinking water disappears .
In California , there was a reduction in 40 percent in the Pacific area of the Sierra .
It &apos;s got to be done in the <unk> .
And as you could read , the projections were serious .
This global drought has led to a dramatic rise of <unk> .
And the number of <unk> around the world has gone up with an incredible and unprecedented speed .
Four times over the last 30 years in the last 30 years ,
This pattern is completely <unk> .
If you look at it from a historical context , you can see what happened here .
Over the last five years , we added 70 million metric tons of CO2 every 24 hours ,
25 <unk> tons of every day in our oceans , looking at the Eastern Pacific Ocean , from America , <unk> , and on every side of India , there &apos;s a <unk> decline of oxygen in the oceans .
The only big problem of global warming , besides deforestation , which is for 20 percent of us , is burning fossil fuels .
<unk> is a problem , and coal is the <unk> problem .
The United States is one of the two largest cities , combined with China .
And there was a proposal to build a lot more <unk> .
But we see a <unk> .
These are the <unk> that were built in the past few years , and where green alternatives were proposed .
But there &apos;s a political battle happening in our country .
The <unk> and <unk> gave up 250 million dollars last year in order to promote clean coal , which is a <unk> .
That image made me think of something .
Around the <unk> , at home in Tennessee , about four billion gallons of <unk> <unk> .
You probably saw it in the news .
This is the one of the largest <unk> in America .
This was happening around the <unk> .
One of the ads of the <unk> was this .
Video : Video : <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> guy .
He &apos;s <unk> here in America , and he makes our economy grow .
<unk> the <unk> of the day ,
He &apos;s affordable and cute and <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
Here &apos;s a big part of the coal in West Virginia .
The biggest <unk> of the country is the great boss of <unk> <unk> .
Video : Don <unk> : Let me be clear . Al Gore , Nancy <unk> , Harry <unk> , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about . &quot;
So , Al Gore : So , the <unk> for <unk> has been put down on a deck of cards .
This is a piece of it .
Video : Video : <unk> , we see climate change as a serious threat to our businesses .
And that &apos;s why it &apos;s our most important goal of giving up a huge amount of money for advertising for the light and the truth of the truth of the matter of coal .
The fact is , coal isn &apos;t <unk> .
We find that it &apos;s clean -- and it still smells like it .
So , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
Let &apos;s talk about it .
Video : <unk> : <unk> of coal , you heard a lot about it .
So let &apos;s take a look at this <unk> of clean <unk> .
Fantastic ! The machines are making some noise .
But that &apos;s the sound of clean light .
Despite the fact that the burning of coal is one of the most important sources of global warming , the remarkable clean data that you see here .
Look closely , this is the clean <unk> of today .
Al Gore : <unk> of the positive alternative in our economic challenges , and that in terms of national security .
Video : Voice : America <unk> in crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
The red line of all these things , at all , is our dependence on fossil fuels , such as dirty coal and gas .
But now there &apos;s a <unk> , new solution to this .
<unk> America of 100 percent of clean electricity in 10 years .
A plan to get America again , a plan that makes us safer and <unk> global warming .
<unk> a solution that is <unk> enough to solve our problems .
<unk> America .
Al Gore : Last .
Video : Voice : It &apos;s about saving America again .
One of the fastest ways to do it is to make an end to our <unk> of old , dirty fuels that help our planet .
Man : Here &apos;s the future . Wind , sun , a new <unk> .
Man # 2 : New investment to create good paying jobs .
Voice : <unk> America . Time to be realistic .
Al Gore : There &apos;s an old African <unk> who says , &quot; If you want to be quick , go alone .
If you want to go far , please join . &quot;
We have to go far , and quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year , I gave you an introduction about the LHC at TED .
And I promised to come back with an update about how that machine works .
So here I am . For those of you who weren &apos;t there : the LHC is the largest scientific experiment of <unk> , 27 kilometers in <unk> .
It has to mimic the conditions that were present in a <unk> of a second of the universe until 600 million times a second ,
<unk> ambitious , so !
This is the machine under <unk> .
We took pictures of those <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and this is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the <unk> detector -- 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
<unk> photo of <unk> in <unk> so you can see the scale .
On January 10th , we opened the machine for the first time ,
This photo was taken by <unk> .
And that was a <unk> in the <unk> Islands .
It &apos;s a photograph of the first <unk> that went around all around the LHC , and <unk> with a piece of the LHC that made particles into the detector ,
In other words , when we saw that picture at 10 september we knew that the machine worked , what a huge victory was .
I don &apos;t know if this was the biggest <unk> , or this one , when somebody went to Google and saw the <unk> looked like this .
And that means that we have a cultural and a scientific impact ,
A week later , we had a problem with the machine , what had to do with these golden buttons .
Those wires <unk> 13 thousand <unk> when the machine worked in full strength .
The engineers under you will say , &quot; Not true . It &apos;s not true . &quot;
They can do that because they &apos;re <unk> on very low temperatures .
So as a matter of <unk> degrees , hotter than the space between the stars , those wires can <unk> .
In one of the connections between the nine thousand species at the LHC , there was a <unk> .
And so , the wire was warmer , and it suddenly became electric <unk> against those 13 thousand <unk> .
This was the result .
This is even more <unk> when you realize that that <unk> more than 20 metric tons , and it &apos;s been moved about 30 inches .
We were about 50 <unk> .
We had to figure out what we did .
We all have <unk> them at all .
Now they &apos;re back on road .
March , the LHC will be intact again .
We &apos;ll turn it back again , and we &apos;ll take measurements of measurements in June or July , so we can move on to figuring out what the building blocks of the universe are .
Now , of course , that <unk> has the debate over the value of scientific research . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we will move beyond , the value of things like the LHC .
I &apos;m going to leave you with the last words of the English scientist <unk> , who , I guess , when the <unk> experiments were Michael <unk> , his student was Michael <unk> , this said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind , that there are no mysteries in nature , that there are no mysteries in nature , and there are no new worlds . &quot;
Thank you .
I &apos;d like to start asking you questions of your childhood , when you were playing with blocks .
When you found out how to grab it , it <unk> and moved , you know , what you &apos;re doing is trying to solve problems in terms of how to deal with it ,
<unk> insight is closely related to understanding the world around us .
As a <unk> , inspired by the use of physical interaction with objects -- along with my <unk> <unk> and my collaborator <unk> <unk> -- I started to ask myself -- what if we used a computer instead of a kind of digital <unk> that moves on a plane , what if we could physically print information with each of our hands .
and can be <unk> like we want ?
And this question was , this question , we decided to look at an answer , by building <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> of an interactive computer ,
They can be moved with their hand , they can feel each other , they can touch their movement , and they contain a screen and wireless contact .
The <unk> is the physical <unk> , just like blocks can be moved by <unk> ,
Furthermore , <unk> are an example of a new ecosystem for manipulating digital information .
because these tools have a more physical <unk> , they &apos;re consciously aware of their movement and from each other , and even the way we move them , there are several new and nice interactions .
I &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
This <unk> has been set up to show a video of a video , which is <unk> and <unk> <unk> ,
These interactive portraits are conscious of each other .
India next to each other , they will be interested in each other .
When they &apos;re surrounded , they notice this also and can be a little nervous .
Furthermore , they feel movement and slope .
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of these interaction , the use of everyday acts , is like a color of a color like it was a fluid .
So in this example , three <unk> of fluorescent paint , and I can use them to cast color in an empty place where they &apos;re mixed .
If we have a <unk> , we pour a little bit back .
There are some handsome possibilities for education , mostly games with language , math and logic where we can give people the opportunity quickly , and see the outcome of the outcome .
Here I &apos;m showing you -- this is the development of a Fibonacci number by a simple <unk> .
Here &apos;s a game that &apos;s a cross between <unk> and <unk> .
And the principle is , in each room , you get a random letter on every page , and <unk> words in a dictionary ,
After about 30 seconds , the whole thing is <unk> , and there &apos;s a new set of letters of <unk> possibilities .
Thank you .
These are a few children at the Media Lab at the Media Lab , and I managed to get it out and make a video of a video .
They really were gone .
And one of the most interesting things about this application is that people don &apos;t need the instructions .
All you have to say is , &quot; Make words , &quot; and they know exactly what they should do .
Here are some other people tested .
That &apos;s our youngest <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
Turns out he just wanted to put up the <unk> .
For him , this was just <unk> .
Here &apos;s an interactive painting .
We wanted to develop a platform for learning language .
This is <unk> <unk> .
He can bring new <unk> into the scene , just by <unk> the <unk> of the table .
So here he is showing the sun .
Video : The sun is coming up .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
Video : The orange toss .
Good job ! Yeah !
So , by the way , if you can take the slide of <unk> and put it next to one another , it can respond to each other -- Video : <unk> !
DM : And so his story is telling you .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story of an open end .
and he decides what it does .
Video : The cat flies .
DM : The last example I &apos;m going to show you today is a <unk> and live <unk> that we have recently developed a sound of a sound like the lead , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> has four different variations , where you can choose what you want to use .
These sounds can be implanted in empty <unk> so you can actually define the pattern itself .
And you put a sound in the pattern of a light through the <unk> of an empty <unk> .
They &apos;re made of a sound and adjusted by <unk> .
The general effects of how rapid performance and volume are applied to the whole pattern ,
Let &apos;s look at it .
Video : Narrator : We start with a lead in two <unk> , to a first pattern , <unk> by an extra lead .
Now I &apos;m going to show you the <unk> .
Video : DM : Now I add a little bit of <unk> .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m linking the filter to the drums so I can affect the effect .
Video : DM : I can speed up the whole thing at the speed of the speed of light ,
Video : DM : Now I connect the filter to the <unk> for a little bit more .
Video : DM : I can <unk> the pattern as it plays .
So I don &apos;t have to plan all of you , but I can improvise , I can improvise , and make a lot of money like I want .
and finally , finally , the <unk> of the whole thing , by the way , by <unk> ,
Thank you .
As you can see , I &apos;m going to take my passion for creating new interfaces that are more aligned in the way that our brains and bodies work .
And today , I had time to show you a new element in this brain , with some possibilities that we &apos;re developing in the lab .
And the thought that I want to leave you with is that this is just a new generation of tools for digital media , which bring the information to our world as we want .
Thank you so much .
I look out to talk to you all .
I &apos;m a writer .
<unk> writing is my work , but also as much as that .
I &apos;m obsessed with writing all of my life , and I don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to change it .
But recently , there had been something weird happening in my life and career , so I had to <unk> my relationship with my work .
And it started with a book that I recently wrote , a <unk> : &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> &quot; , which was very , very contrary to the whole world , and became an international <unk> .
And the consequence is that people now join me and join me as if I are <unk> .
<unk> that -- <unk> !
People come to me and ask me and ask me , &quot; You don &apos;t worry about this success ?
Don &apos;t worry that you &apos;re going to write your whole life on your whole life , but never ever published a book where people will walk warm ?
Don &apos;t you fear ? &quot;
Very <unk> , you know .
Of course , that would be a great thing . But I remember thinking about 20 years ago -- I was a teenager when I told you I wanted to be a writer .
People said , &quot; Are you not afraid you will never get success ?
Are you not afraid of <unk> ?
Don &apos;t worry that you &apos;re going to dedicate your life to this work without ever knowing and that you will die on the debris of your broken dreams with your mouth <unk> as a failure ? &quot;
It &apos;s a little bit of <unk> .
So in a nutshell , my answer to these questions : &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all these things that are being mentioned .
<unk> .
But I &apos;m also afraid of all sorts of other things , you don &apos;t want to know all that .
For example , for example , for example , for example , and other scary things ,
But in terms of writing in terms of the last time , I ask myself the last time that fear comes from .
Is it rational ?
Does it make sense that someone is supposed to be afraid for the work that they have on Earth ?
What &apos;s so special about the creative processes is that we worry about the effects on the <unk> , something that doesn &apos;t happen at all at all .
Take my dad . He was a <unk> engineer , and I can &apos;t remember that in the 40 years he had been working on him if he had a person who had never been afraid of him .
Like , &quot; John , how about you ? &quot;
No , it didn &apos;t talk about it .
To be fair : <unk> engineers have not been given the reputation for the centuries in the world ,
<unk> , they have such a reputation .
It &apos;s not just writers , nor other creative people , apparently the reputation &apos;s best <unk> .
Look at the <unk> <unk> of the 20th century ,
Many died young , often by <unk> .
And even those who don &apos;t <unk> themselves , they seem to be <unk> under their <unk> .
In the last interview for his death , Norman <unk> said , &quot; With each of my books is a piece of mine . &quot;
That &apos;s a little bit of what you &apos;re talking about .
But we don &apos;t look at these kinds of statements anymore .
We &apos;ve all heard all of it before , and we have all accepted .
And the dominant thought of creativity is that creativity has been connected to suffering , and that <unk> will eventually lead to misery .
So I &apos;d like to ask you all here today : Can you do that ?
Are you okay ?
Because I &apos;m a little bit about <unk> , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a <unk> thought .
I love it .
and also even dangerous .
I wouldn &apos;t like to see that this century this century is going on .
We can <unk> creative minds much better to live .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s going to be particularly dangerous to me in my situation , particularly dangerous thought to be alive .
I think that &apos;s the scene where my career is now <unk> .
I &apos;m just a young person : I &apos;m still young , barely <unk> .
I may have been <unk> for four decades .
What I &apos;m going to talk to you about is , in fact , what I &apos;m going to talk to you about today is being seen by the outside world as the work that was followed on that very <unk> book ,
We &apos;re here to be friends with friends , so I can tell you : <unk> is my greatest success .
<unk> , what an idea !
If you &apos;re going to think about it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be thinking about it in the morning at
So I don &apos;t want you .
I prefer to work on the work that I love .
The question is , &quot; How ? &quot;
So for a long time , I came up with the conclusion of the conclusion that I can only be able to write a psychological protection in the process ,
I need to see a safe distance between myself and by the way , by the way , I have a desperate distance for the reactions of my future <unk> .
I &apos;ve been looking for ways for the last year to do that .
I &apos;ve been <unk> in history , and I &apos;ve been <unk> in other civilizations , seeing whether or not others might have found a better way to help with creative people in the creative process ,
My quest brought me to the old Greeks and <unk> .
Watch , because it &apos;s a long and complicated story .
In the time of the ancient Greeks and <unk> people didn &apos;t believe that creativity came from <unk> .
It was believed that creativity was a <unk> mind , which of a distant , <unk> place to human beings , for <unk> and <unk> reasons .
The Greeks called this <unk> <unk> of creativity ,
And also , <unk> believed that he had a <unk> <unk> that <unk> him .
The <unk> had a <unk> idea .
It was called a <unk> of creative mind .
The funny thing is , the <unk> with a genius with a genius with a genius .
And in their experience , a genius was a sort of a magic <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the walls of the artist .
a little bit like <unk> the <unk> .
When the artist was working at work , he <unk> a genius .
<unk> gave him a form of work .
<unk> ! That &apos;s exactly the distance I talked about earlier , the psychological protection of the results of your work .
Everybody knew how to work in their work ,
And the artist , for example , has been pushed into protection , for example ,
If your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t pay all the honor .
Because everybody knew that an invisible genius had helped you .
<unk> your work , not just to you .
Everyone knew you a kind of a <unk> genius .
For a long time , there &apos;s been a way of seeing in the West .
Then the Renaissance came , and everything changed .
And there &apos;s a really new idea : the individual human being is the center of the universe , and there &apos;s above all of the gods and the mysteries of the universe and mysteries .
Not a space for <unk> creatures , <unk> from the world .
And that was the beginning of the rational <unk> .
People believed creativity was entirely taken out of the individual individuals .
And for the first time in history , there were artists of artists who were a genius , not that they had a genius .
I have to say honestly , I think I &apos;m a big mistake .
To give one person , one individual only believed that he or she is the <unk> , the essence of the eternal mystery , of all the things , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of a human psyche .
as if you ask somebody to ask the sun .
<unk> are <unk> to massive <unk> , and there are incredibly high expectations of performance .
And I think this pressure has broken many artists for the last 500 years .
If that &apos;s true , and I think , I think , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
Can we do this differently ?
Can we <unk> on a long-term understanding of the relationship between humans and the creative mystery ?
Maybe not .
We may not be able to put a <unk> <unk> in the next 18 minutes ,
Probably in the audience , there are people who are talking about <unk> scientific <unk> about the idea that <unk> <unk> <unk> the work of artists to be inspiring .
It doesn &apos;t seem to me that I &apos;m all going to leave you with all of it .
But I ask you to ask me .
Why not ?
Why should we not follow that thought ?
It &apos;s just as much wood as all of the other explanations of all of the <unk> <unk> that decided in the creative process ,
And anybody who has been trying to create something -- so in fact , all of the <unk> here -- knows that the creative process doesn &apos;t always act at the same time .
It feels like it &apos;s almost <unk> .
I met the amazing American <unk> <unk> <unk> Stone .
She &apos;s a thick in her 90s . All of her life already writes poems .
She told me about her youth in rural Virginia .
Sometimes , when she was working on the field , she felt , they heard a poem , about the country .
It was , like , a big wave of air ,
It &apos;s one of these poems that <unk> about the country .
She felt that the ground beneath her feet started to shake up and knew that she was at that time , ran a thing : running for her life .
and then she ran home , <unk> by the poem , and she had to go as soon as <unk> and paper ,
When the poem came along , when the poem came along , it was her only opportunity to write it .
Sometimes they weren &apos;t fast enough .
Then she ran and ran , but I didn &apos;t get the house .
So in such a time , in such a time , the poem was shot by her , in the fields of the fields , looking for her words -- to another poet .
There were also a lot of times -- I think this is the most beautiful part of the story -- that it &apos;s almost <unk> .
Then she was in a house looking for pen and paper , and he shot the poem through her ,
Right at that time , she had a pencil to take a pencil .
And with her other hand , she told me , she <unk> the poem from the sky .
And she grabbed the poem with his tail , and she pulled back in her body while they were <unk> .
And in those cases , the poem came down in a piece of paper , but in reverse order ,
When I heard that , I thought , well , what happens ?
So my creative process doesn &apos;t work ! I &apos;m not a medium !
I &apos;m a <unk> , who <unk> every day at the same time , and with blood , sweat and tears <unk> .
But even in that day , I &apos;ve had a kind of experience of that day .
You may also know , you know , that feeling that there may be creative ideas in your life from a source that you can never identify .
So what is that for the source ?
How can we use it without getting rid of it ?
In a way that &apos;s good for us ?
The best example I can think of here is a musician &apos;s musician .
A couple of years ago I interviewed him for a magazine .
We talked about this .
Tom is actually a part of his life , the <unk> of the <unk> artist today who &apos;s trying to get rid of all of the <unk> of the <unk> creative <unk> that he put in him .
And over the years , Tom was a little <unk> .
One day he drove in Los Angeles over the highway , and he changed the process radically .
And as he drove up there , he heard a <unk> of a melody ,
It <unk> him , like inspiration , <unk> , <unk> .
It was a nice melody , and he wanted to hold it down .
But that didn &apos;t go .
He had no <unk> , no pen , no <unk> .
The <unk> tension took him back , and he said , &quot; I &apos;m losing the melody , and then it keeps me <unk> .
I &apos;m not good enough , I can &apos;t . &quot;
He didn &apos;t have a panic in panic , but he stopped doing that whole mental process and doing something new .
And he looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; Sorry , I &apos;m sorry , you can &apos;t see I &apos;m behind the wheel ? &quot;
&quot; Do you really think I can <unk> a song ?
If you really want this song , you &apos;ll have to wait a little bit later when I have time for you .
It &apos;s not like , let &apos;s put someone else &apos;s going on .
Come on to Leonard Cohen .
The work itself is still the same , with the well-known dark <unk> .
But the heavy tension that the creative process of the creative process failed when he was <unk> from genius .
It was a genius that was too close on the skin , and it was just a little bit <unk> .
And Tom realized that there wasn &apos;t a reason why there was no reason to go down .
It could be an amazing , bizarre collaboration , a kind of a conversation between Tom and the <unk> aspect of it not entirely from Tom himself .
And that story has changed my way .
I already had a <unk> of it .
I was sitting in the middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
At a time , I <unk> in despair .
You know , you know , you know , your work is not going to work properly and you think it &apos;s a terrible disaster , the worst book ever ,
Not just bad , really bad .
I wanted to <unk> the whole project .
And then I remembered Tom who <unk> to his genius , and I decided to take an attempt .
I sent myself off from my manuscript and turned me into a blank corner of the room .
And I said out loud : &quot; Listen , we both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not just by me .
You can see that I put all of you on me .
I can &apos;t give you any time .
If you think it can be better , you have to get your thing to your thing .
Are you kidding ? Don &apos;t worry about it .
I just write because that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing ,
Oh , and in the <unk> , I think you can be mentioned that <unk> only in the office today . &quot;
And finally , finally , it comes down here ,
<unk> years ago , in the <unk> desert , people came together with <unk> dancing on sacred music .
<unk> and hours of <unk> ,
That was always great , because the dancers were <unk> professionals .
But sometimes , sometimes , something amazing happened .
One of those dancers then <unk> .
You know , you know what I mean , you know what I mean , you may have seen something like a performer .
It was as if time was <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through a gate .
He didn &apos;t do anything much different than the thousands of nights , but all together .
And suddenly , he didn &apos;t seem to be a human .
And in fact , in front of him , he was <unk> him .
A <unk> fire <unk> him .
When something happened at the time , people knew what it was they started clapping and saying , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God , God . &quot;
Because that was for them .
By the way , a nice historical <unk> : When the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they brought this habit together .
But the statement has been changed over the centuries from all over the centuries of Allah , in &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
You can still hear that today at <unk> and <unk> .
If an artist in Spain in Spain does something magical or magical , then people will say , &quot; Allah , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , see : a glimpse of God .
Exactly what we need .
But nevertheless , the next thing is , the next morning , the next morning , the next morning , at the end of the day , he &apos;s not going to have a <unk> <unk> in the world at 11 a.m .
And at that time , he &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> <unk> <unk> that may never have been <unk> to such a <unk> .
Maybe there will never be any one of us to be able to write God during his dance .
What should he have to do with the rest of his life ?
That &apos;s hard .
That &apos;s really hard to <unk> for a creative mind .
But as painful as painful doesn &apos;t have to be .
Imagine if you haven &apos;t been <unk> that the most unusual aspects of your person will come from <unk> .
Imagine if you had to <unk> a while a while a while ago .
When you &apos;re done , they &apos;re transmitted to someone else .
That &apos;s how I think it &apos;s all <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk about that thought ,
For the last few months , I &apos;ve been working on a book that will come soon . The book that goes on a long time is <unk> .
The <unk> of those <unk> <unk> .
When my thinking comes down to me , I always love the same thing : Don &apos;t worry about it : Don &apos;t worry about it .
Get your work .
Just keep your thing doing , whatever it is .
If it &apos;s your job to dance , I &apos;m going to dance .
If you &apos;re a brilliant genius , you decide to leave your work at some point in your work at some point of time , than &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
Don &apos;t laugh at that , dance , please .
And also , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
I believe that I &apos;m going to believe you .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; anyway , anyway , because we just <unk> out of pure human love and <unk> anyway .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : <unk> !
You know , I &apos;ve been talking about a couple of these projects , about the human genome , and what can be done , and finding new sets of genes of genes .
We actually start from a new point : We were exploring biology , and now we &apos;re trying to move from that digital code to a new stage in biology , with design and <unk> of life .
So we &apos;ve been trying to ask the big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; is something that I think a lot of biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
We tried to have a different approach , and bring it back to minimal components .
We &apos;re now exploring it for 20 years .
When we analyzed the human genome , it was from the analog world of biology , to the digital world of the computer ,
Now we &apos;re trying to ask : Can we be able to regenerate life , or can we create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , <unk> <unk> , with the smallest genome for a species that can replicate in a laboratory .
And we &apos;ve been trying to see if we can get to a even smaller genome .
We can throw in the order of a hundred genes from the 500 or so , which are there .
But if we look at the <unk> map , that &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours .
Believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all of the genes that we can turn through , it &apos;s very unlikely to be a living cell .
So we decided that the only way forward was to <unk> this chromosome so that we could <unk> the components of the most fundamental questions .
And so we started asking questions like , &quot; Can we <unk> a chromosome ? &quot;
Does the chemistry make these very large molecules that we haven &apos;t seen before ?
And , if we can do that , a chromosome is starting ?
A chromosome , by the way , is a piece of chemical inert material material .
So , our pace of exploring life is accelerated to exponential new ways .
Our ability to write the genetic code is quite slow , but it &apos;s been increased .
And our last point is , at this moment , it would be places on an exponential curve .
We started a more than 15 years ago .
And there were a number of <unk> , starting with a <unk> <unk> of the first experiments ,
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make little pieces of DNA , 30 to 50 letters in length , and it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make the work , the more errors you are .
So we had to make a new method for bringing these little pieces together and writing all of the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome called X <unk> .
That &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the pieces , we did the <unk>
and had a <unk> of about 5,000 letters .
And the exciting part of it was when we stopped an inert piece of chemical dust in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code , and put viral markers on .
And the viral subatomic particles were then <unk> out of the cells , they came back and <unk> the E. <unk> .
I was recently speaking to the <unk> , and I said , &quot; Well , I said that model but too well . &quot;
They laughed more than you .
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted a lot of <unk> .
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome .
That &apos;s more than <unk> letters of genetic code .
And so we decided to build them on <unk> for the size of viruses so that we could vary the <unk>
to understand what the <unk> components are of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and when you start with digital information in the computer , that digital information must be very accurate .
When we first arrived at this genome in 1995 , the <unk> was one error per 10,000 <unk> .
And finally , after all , we found 30 of 30 errors . If we had used the original sequence of the original , it didn &apos;t have been able to start .
<unk> of the design is designed to be a hundred letters long , which have to be <unk> with all the other pieces of paper that we need to be designed to be designed to be able to design .
We &apos;re designing for unique parts of it .
Maybe you read that we &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
Consider this : We have a <unk> genetic code : A , C , G and T.
<unk> pages of these letters for roughly 20 amino acids -- there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> for each other .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , phrases , thoughts .
We &apos;re just <unk> .
Some were frustrated that there were no poems .
We &apos;ve designed these pieces that we can eat with <unk> .
There are <unk> that are <unk> and put together .
And we started to start making pieces , starting with pieces that were five to 7,000 letters long , and you have a piece of <unk> letter , and you have a piece of <unk> letter , and then you take these pieces of paper , and then you take it off , and you put them together ,
So in each stadium , we <unk> a <unk> of these pieces so that we could <unk> them because we wanted to create a process that &apos;s very robust -- that will see you later .
We &apos;re trying to achieve the issue of <unk> .
So this looks like a <unk> .
And as soon as we come up with the really large pieces -- over 100,000 species -- they don &apos;t grow so much in E. <unk> .
That requires the whole of the modern tools of molecular biology .
And so we started <unk> in other mechanisms .
We had a mechanism called <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is used by biology to repair DNA , that can put pieces together .
Here &apos;s an example of it .
There &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> that can make three million <unk> of radiation .
And that &apos;s what you see in the upper right-hand corner , the chromosome , just <unk> .
12 <unk> of 24 hours later , he put it together , exactly as the first time ,
There are thousands of organisms that can do this .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
They can live in a vacuum
I &apos;m absolutely sure that there can be life in space in space , that can be a new <unk> environment .
NASA , by the way , has shown that there &apos;s a lot of stuff out there , outside there .
Here &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of the molecule that we have made with these processes -- in fact , with only the right design of the little design of the pieces that we did .
<unk> makes them automatically put together .
This is not a <unk> ; this is a regular <unk> .
It &apos;s such a big molecule that we can see with a <unk> .
These are photos , taken over a period of six seconds ,
This is the publication we recently completed .
This is more than <unk> letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule ever made by people , with a clear structure .
The <unk> is over 300 million .
If we could take it off with a <unk> brief , no <unk> , then there &apos;s <unk> pages only to put the genetic code .
Well , how do we start a chromosome ? How do we activate it ?
Now , a virus is pretty easy to use .
With a bacterium , it &apos;s much more complicated .
It &apos;s also <unk> when you &apos;re <unk> under your <unk> , like we &apos;re just <unk> out of the <unk> and doing one another , and that &apos;s what you know as <unk> .
In the <unk> , the chromosome is integrated in the cell , but we recently have shown that we can perform a full <unk> of a chromosome from a cell to another , and it can activate .
We have a bacterial chromosome ,
These are just as far removed from each other as humans and mice .
We added a little extra genes so that we could select for this chromosome .
We have a <unk> with <unk> to make all the proteins .
It was quite <unk> when we stopped putting this into the cell -- and you &apos;re going to appreciate the very advanced graphic footage here -- the new chromosome in the cell .
We even thought he &apos;d come up with that too far , but we tried to develop the process a little bit further .
This is an essential <unk> .
We discover all sorts of species that have a second chromosome or a third of them , where they add thousands of properties in one time ,
People who imagine evolution as if there &apos;s one gene at the same time , not many biology <unk> .
There are <unk> that are called <unk> <unk> that actually <unk> DNA .
The chromosome in the cell was not there .
The cell -- the chromosome that we put in --
It was expressed , and it recognized the other chromosome of a strange material , and that &apos;s why we finally had the cell with the new chromosome .
It was blue because of the genes we had stopped in it .
And in a very short time , all of the <unk> of one species disappeared , and he completely changed the new kind of thing , based on the new software that we had stopped in the cell .
All the proteins changed , the <unk> changed -- when we analyzed the genetic code , it was exactly where it changed .
So this may sound like <unk> , but we &apos;re capable of changing the software , to change things fundamentally .
Well , I think , well , I &apos;ve been thinking earlier that this is not a creation -- this is <unk> on 3.5 billion years of evolution , and I have convinced that we may be a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we have on a major scale of new species of new species , based on this digital design .
Why would you do this ?
I think it &apos;s quite clear if you look at what &apos;s needed .
We &apos;re going to go from <unk> to nine billion people over the next 40 years ,
To put it in my context : I was born in 1946 .
There are three people on this planet ,
for each of us who lived in 1946 ; within 40 years , there will be four .
We have trouble with food , with <unk> water , medicine , gas for the <unk> billion .
It &apos;s hard to do that for nine .
We use five billion tons of coal , over 30 billion barrels of barrels .
That &apos;s 100 <unk> barrels a day .
When we take biological processes in <unk> or whatever process , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
Then , of course , there &apos;s all of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that comes into the atmosphere .
Now , all of our global discoveries are now a database of about 20 million genes , and that would be what I would like to think of as the <unk> of the future .
The <unk> had only a dozen different components , and look at the diversity that &apos;s coming out there .
We are largely constrained by a biological reality and our imagination .
We now have tools of <unk> to be called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
We have the ability to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
If you think about the processing of 20 million different genes , or trying to optimize processes of processes to produce , new vaccines , new vaccine , we can be able to do more molecular biology than in the last 20 years of science ,
And it &apos;s only standard selection .
We can select for <unk> , chemical or <unk> , and so on .
So this is a <unk> of what we &apos;re working on , so you can really go on and design a new kind of thing on the computer and design a new kind of thing on the computer .
We don &apos;t know what it will look like .
We know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
We &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation of fuels .
Recently , you have seen grain to ethanol , just a bad experiment .
We have second and third generation of fuels that will come out soon , like sugar , to more <unk> fuels like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way we think that biology can have a huge impact is without making the <unk> higher and lower the availability if we start with CO2 as a source of CO2 , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re doing the first fourth generation of fuels in about 18 months .
<unk> and CO2 is a method -- but by our global <unk> , we have all sorts of other methods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 ,
It lives in the <unk> desert , about a mile deep , at <unk> hot temperatures .
It makes methane of CO2 using molecular hydrogen ,
We &apos;re looking at it if we can take a look at solid CO2 , which can be easily transported to factories , where that CO2 is <unk> to fuel , to send this process .
So in a nutshell , we think , in a nutshell , we &apos;re able to expand to the basic question : &quot; What is life ? &quot;
We really have , you know , we have -- you know , you have the modest goals of the <unk> industry .
Yeah . If you can &apos;t do this at TED , what ?
A major energy source .
But we &apos;re also working now using these tools to come up with rapid prototyping vaccine .
This year there was the flu , we &apos;re always walking around the facts when it comes to the right vaccine .
I think that can change the way of making vaccines possible .
So here you can see what the future is going to look like when the brain is going to change , the speed of evolution of synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and eventually <unk> .
We are far removed from people .
Our goal is to make sure that we can make a chance for a long time to do that . Thank you very much .
What I first wanted to show you is the <unk> of a new technology that we gave at Microsoft to Microsoft about a year ago . This is <unk> .
And it &apos;s an environment where you can work locally or at a distance with massive amounts of visual data .
We &apos;re looking at a lot of <unk> of digital images here , and we can <unk> seamlessly here and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> to our wish .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these <unk> are or images .
Most of these are normal digital cameras , but this is a <unk> scan of the Library of Congress , and in the 300 years , there &apos;s been a <unk> range .
It doesn &apos;t matter anything like that because the only thing that &apos;s going on is going to affect the performance , the number of pixels on the screen ,
It &apos;s also a very flexible architecture .
This is a completely new book , an example of <unk> data .
This is the <unk> house by Dickens . Any column is a chapter .
To prove that it &apos;s really a piece of text , and no image , we can do something like this , to show you that this is really text ; this is not a picture .
Maybe this is a rather strange way to read a <unk> .
I wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
This is a <unk> example . This is a <unk> of The Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a piece ,
So this gives you the pleasure and the experience of a real paper magazine or newspaper , which is actually a <unk> medium .
We also did something with the corner of this <unk> of The Guardian ,
We made a fake ad from high resolution -- much higher than a regular ad -- and we have <unk> information .
If you want to see the possibilities of this car , you see it .
or other models , or even technical <unk> .
And these ideas can really make sure that we can <unk> the limitations of the brain ,
We hope that this is not a <unk> <unk> anymore , and other industries like that -- will be more .
Of course , <unk> are a <unk> application for a technology like this , I &apos;m not going to spend time on this , except that we can also contribute to this field too much .
These are all roads in America .
put on top of a picture of NASA .
Let &apos;s look at something else .
This , by the way , is live on the Web ; you can watch it .
This project is called <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
One of them is <unk> , and the other is a very nice piece of <unk> research by Noah <unk> at the University of Washington , <unk> by Steve <unk> on <unk> .
and Rick <unk> at Microsoft Research .
So this is live on the Web . It &apos;s <unk> possible by <unk> .
When we do this , when we &apos;re doing this , you see that we &apos;re traveling through the images and seeing the <unk> .
The <unk> of the imagery of the images here have meaning .
The <unk> algorithms have shown these images so that they correspond to the true space -- the <unk> <unk> in the temporal lobes -- where they &apos;re taken , and this is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> or <unk> images , and all of these things are <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m not sure if there &apos;s still time , to show other environments .
There are still a lot of <unk> .
I &apos;d like to show you one of <unk> &apos;s original <unk> -- and this is from an early prototype of <unk> that we &apos;ve been working on this summer -- to see the actual power of this technique , at looking at the environments on our website .
We had to take care of the lawyers and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> lady with images from Flickr , and you &apos;re just looking for <unk> Dame on Flickr , and you &apos;re given images of people in <unk> , and the campus and so on .
And each one of these orange links is an image of this model of this model .
And so all of these are <unk> images that are connected in this way .
And we can navigate in simple ways .
You know , I never thought I would ever work with Microsoft .
It &apos;s <unk> here .
I believe you can see that this is a lot of cameras , all of the cell phones , all of the cell phones , a large number of them , <unk> in this environment .
I &apos;m going to try and find some strange images .
There are so much covered by faces and so on .
In other words , there &apos;s a series of photos of pictures -- here they are .
This is even a poster by the <unk> lady who has been approved by the program ,
If we were to dive through the poster , in a physical image of this environment .
What we want to say to this is that we can really do things here with social environment . This is now what &apos;s used to the data from everybody -- from the whole collective memory of how , on Earth , and <unk> that everything .
All these <unk> are united with each other , and they form a whole thing larger than the sum of the parts .
You have a model that comes from all over the Earth .
Think of this as a miracle at Stephen <unk> &apos;s work .
And this is something that grows in complexity when people use it , and also the benefits of the people who use it .
They have their own photos of <unk> that are <unk> .
If anybody wanted to put all of these sacred <unk> and put their names on it , my photo of all of that data , all of a sudden , I can use all that data , and then I can use it as a access to that space , which <unk> , <unk> photos of <unk> photos , and with a shared social experience ,
And of course , the <unk> of this is an immensely rich model of any interesting place on Earth , which is not just from <unk> , <unk> and other uses , but also from the collective memory perspective .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : Have I understood that what can make your software possible for a day , in the next few years , all of the images that can be shared by anyone in the world ?
<unk> : Yes . What this really does is discover .
The <unk> , to your wish , <unk> between images .
And it does that on the basis of the data in the imagery ,
And that &apos;s very exciting when you think about the richness of <unk> information that many of these images have been ,
When you look at the web at the web , you &apos;re going to put a <unk> in , and the text on the <unk> contains a lot of information about what the image is .
What if that image is linked to all your pictures ?
Then , the number of mutual connections , and the amount of wealth that comes out of that is huge . It &apos;s a classic <unk> .
CA : <unk> , that &apos;s really amazing . <unk> .
One of the intense <unk> of travel and <unk> research is the ability to live between those who don &apos;t forget the old habits , which have their past in the wind , touch through rain <unk> , the taste of <unk> stone , the taste of <unk> <unk> .
The science that still travels past the Milky Way , or that the <unk> of <unk> are still <unk> , or that in the Himalayas of the Himalayas of <unk> <unk> , you really appreciate the <unk> of the <unk> : the world in which we don &apos;t live in a absolute sense , but is only one model of reality .
the result of a <unk> set of <unk> that were making our ancestors generations ago ,
Of course , we all share the same <unk> <unk> : <unk> children in the world .
We &apos;re all <unk> .
<unk> with the <unk> separation of death .
So it can &apos;t be a surprise that we all sing , dancing and art .
But interesting is the unique <unk> of the song and the rhythm of the dance in every diverse culture .
Or that &apos;s now about <unk> in the <unk> Islands , or the <unk> in Haiti , or the fighters in the <unk> River in <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> River . This is the man with whom I traveled across the desert , a month ago , as I traveled across the desert , a month ago at the <unk> of <unk> .
Everest , the <unk> of the world .
They &apos;re taught all of us that we can be a different way of thinking , can perhaps be <unk> on Earth .
If you think about it , this is just a hope of giving you hope .
Together , the <unk> cultures in the world form a web of <unk> and cultural life that the planet <unk> and for her as much as the biological <unk> : the biosphere .
This cultural <unk> can imagine as a <unk> .
You can define the <unk> as all of the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , ideas , <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> by the human imagination since the beginning of our consciousness .
The <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
And she &apos;s the symbol of all that we &apos;re all at , and all of us can be , like , amazing <unk> species .
Just as much as the biosphere is affected , the <unk> is <unk> and much larger .
No biologist would dare to say that at least half of all species are at the brink of extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true .
And that , the most <unk> scenario , is not even near the most optimistic scenario of cultural diversity .
The best indicator of these are the loss of languages .
When everybody was born here , there were <unk> languages spoken on Earth .
A language is more than her vocabulary or her <unk> rules .
A language is a <unk> of the human soul .
It &apos;s the vehicle that allows the soul of each other to achieve the material world .
Every language is a <unk> <unk> , a separation , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
Today , from those <unk> languages , we don &apos;t know half of that in <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> <unk> .
<unk> means that unless a change is <unk> , they &apos;re dead .
Is there something more magical than <unk> by silence , the last of your people to be your language , not having a chance of giving you the wisdom of the ancestors or the <unk> of the children ?
Right there is a lot of <unk> of a human condition every two weeks on Earth , because every two weeks of an elderly , and with him , the last <unk> of an ancient language .
Some of you say , &quot; Would the world be not a better place if we were talking all the language ? &quot; I said , &quot; Great , let &apos;s take Yoruba , or <unk> . &quot;
Or <unk> . &quot; You will suddenly realize what it wouldn &apos;t be your language .
So what I really want to do today is take you on a little journey through the <unk> , which has to draw a picture of what has gone through ,
Many of us forgot that when I talk about it , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I
Take this <unk> in the <unk> , the people of <unk> , who believe that they &apos;re coming out of <unk> , from the east , in the <unk> of sacred snakes .
This is a people that don &apos;t distinguish the colors blue and green , because the <unk> of the <unk> are right on the <unk> of the <unk> , where the people depend on it .
They have a <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> : You have to marry someone who speaks a different language .
This has its roots in the Arctic , but the extraordinary <unk> in your houses , where six or seven languages spoken by these <unk> marriages , but you never have a language to practice a language .
They &apos;re just listening , and they start talking .
One of the <unk> tribes that I lived on , which I lived on , the <unk> of <unk> , was an amazing person who had been touched in 1958 .
In 1957 , five <unk> were trying to connect , but they made a mistake .
From the sky , they <unk> photos of themselves with <unk> <unk> , where they found that this people had never seen a <unk> picture .
They <unk> the photos and tried to find the shape behind the face .
When they found nothing , they <unk> the devil , and then the devil was brought down with <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> are not just <unk> , but also each other .
54 percent of their <unk> came from <unk> .
We could go back to eight generations of <unk> , where we found two cases of a natural death ,
When we were <unk> , they admitted that a man had ever died of age , and then at the same time , they were <unk> . But at the same time , they had an amazing <unk> knowledge of <unk> .
Their hunters were able to smell urine in 40 <unk> and tell you what species were like .
In the early &apos; 80s , I received an amazing commission when my professor asked me whether I wanted to go to Haiti to be a secret <unk> that the foundation of president <unk> and the <unk> of the president were <unk> and so on and so on to reveal the venom safely .
To be able to understand these kinds of things , I had to first learn a little bit about this particular belief , which is not a <unk> of black magic .
It &apos;s a really interesting <unk> worldview , very interesting .
Would I ask you to call the Great <unk> , what would you say ?
<unk> , Islam , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
One continent is always left behind , from the point of view that sub-Saharan Africa didn &apos;t have a religious belief , but of course they had this .
<unk> is simply the <unk> of these profound religious ideas , spread in the tragic Diaspora during the Civil Rights movement .
What makes is interesting is the live ratio between the <unk> and the dead ratio .
The <unk> <unk> the minds .
And the minds may be <unk> from under the Great Water , <unk> on the <unk> where the soul of living <unk> will be <unk> , so during that one wonderful moment , the <unk> moment will be the god .
And so , <unk> like <unk> : &quot; You guys go to church and talk about God .
We &apos;re dancing in the temple and becoming God . &quot; And because you &apos;re so obsessed with the mind , what can you do ?
This leads to an amazing marketing campaign : <unk> in trance that <unk> <unk> of coal .
This <unk> <unk> the ability of the mind to affect the body when it comes to extreme <unk> .
From all of the <unk> that I &apos;ve ever been living with , the <unk> are the most extraordinary , a people in northern Canada .
<unk> of the <unk> , which had once represented the <unk> of Columbia <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
They went back into an isolated <unk> <unk> that was above the <unk> <unk> .
In a low-income continent , only this nation was never ruled by the <unk> .
Still , they &apos;re still <unk> by ritual <unk> , but the training of <unk> is quite special .
The young <unk> are <unk> in their families if they &apos;re three or four .
They &apos;re <unk> in a world of darkness , in stone , in stone , for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years , which is a <unk> <unk> to mimic the nine months of <unk> that they spent in their mother &apos;s lap .
Now , they &apos;re speaking in a way of speaking in the lap of the great mother .
This whole time , the <unk> of the social values , of values that are <unk> the assumption that only <unk> can hold the cosmic balance of <unk> balance .
This <unk> stopped at the time , and for the first time in their lives , when they &apos;re 18 , when they &apos;re 18 , they &apos;re seeing a <unk> moment of consciousness , when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the magnificent landscape with her light <unk> , suddenly all of which they have learned abstract <unk> in the whole glory of <unk> in the whole glory , and the <unk> will say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
&quot; See ? It &apos;s like I said you said . &quot;
That &apos;s how beautiful it is . It &apos;s to protect the older brothers .
They think we are the younger brothers who are responsible for the destruction of the world .
At this point , it &apos;s very important .
When we think about indigenous housing and landscape , we often <unk> <unk> and the old <unk> of the <unk> , an idea that <unk> is in its simplicity .
Or we can take <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are still <unk> , even <unk> <unk> .
And for both of these , a little bit of space in the Middle East , or in the <unk> winds of Tibet , they have been <unk> by time and ritual <unk> a traditional <unk> of the Earth , which is not on the idea of &quot; there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , &quot; the idea that the Earth may have only existed , because human consciousness has given it the <unk> .
What does it mean ? It means that a little kid out of the Andes , which grew up with the belief that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that will be a major human , and a different relationship to that <unk> or that place of a small child in Montana , grew up with the idea that the mountain pile is a pile of stone , ready to go to mines .
Whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a lot of <unk> , is irrelevant .
Interestingly , the metaphor of the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were there to be <unk> .
That made me a different person than my friends of mine , who believe that those forests are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the world .
These minds are important when they &apos;re <unk> .
If you start to think about the idea of these cultures , you can start to understand the cultures , you start to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , take this plant .
It &apos;s a photograph that I took in April of April 15th .
This is <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ,
And what makes me fascinating is not just the <unk> potential of it , but how <unk> it is . It &apos;s built from two sources .
<unk> is a wooden sheet of wood , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and light <unk> .
If you just take the plant , it looks like a blue <unk> <unk> through your consciousness .
The plant is <unk> with leaves of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The plant carries powerful <unk> , closely related to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Have you ever seen the <unk> of <unk> when they &apos;re <unk> , the substance of different species of species ?
That powder of your nose has been shot out of a gun , <unk> with <unk> images , to land on a sea of electricity , and this is not a <unk> of the reality of the reality ; it &apos;s <unk> <unk> of reality .
I tried to convince my professor , Richard Evan <unk> , a man who ran the <unk> age of <unk> in Mexico in the 1930s ,
I found that these <unk> are not <unk> as <unk> , because when the effect is doing , there &apos;s no more home to experience the <unk> , there are no <unk> <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> <unk> , because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> in the human <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
They can only be <unk> with something that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> effects .
The fascinating thing is that the <unk> of the <unk> are the necessary <unk> to activate the <unk> . Imagine the question : How can this people in a circle of 80,000 <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> variant of the whole species that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts ?
We say , &quot; <unk> and bust , &quot; which is <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> say , &quot; The plants are talking against us . &quot; And what does that mean ? This <unk> , the <unk> , knows 17 varieties of <unk> that they can all relate to in our eyes as one species .
If you ask them how to map their <unk> , they say , &quot; I thought you knew something of plants .
You don &apos;t know anything at all ? &apos; I said no .
And it turns out , you can hear all of the 17 species of insects in a night , in a deep moon , in a place where you &apos;re singing .
You don &apos;t care at Harvard University , but it &apos;s a piece of <unk> than <unk> .
Now , the problem is that even those of us who are standing on top of us are standing as <unk> and seeing them as <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but <unk> to a <unk> in the history of the real world , continuing our world .
The truth is , the 20th century years will not be reminded of the wars or the of the technological innovations , but rather than the age of the age we were standing , and actively <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> at the planetary level of biological and cultural diversity on the planet .
All cultures have always <unk> a dance with new <unk> .
Technology is also not the problem .
The <unk> didn &apos;t have to be Sioux when they were <unk> their arrow and bow down , as a matter of fact , as much as Americans stopped when they left their horse and <unk> .
It &apos;s not a change or technology that <unk> the integrity of the <unk> . It &apos;s power .
The <unk> face of <unk> .
So wherever you look at the world , you will notice that it &apos;s not the fate of these cultures .
These are dynamically <unk> <unk> , whose <unk> are <unk> by <unk> forces that are reaching by their <unk> .
Or this is now about the massive deforestation of <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> people that lived and with the last generation in the forest , and now <unk> to <unk> and prostitution on the <unk> , where you can see that the river itself has been <unk> with the <unk> Sea , where Japanese <unk> is <unk> to the <unk> Sea , where Japanese <unk> waiting for the <unk> Sea .
to fill in the ships of the forest ,
In the case of the <unk> , the diseases that are <unk> are <unk> as a result of the discovery of gold .
Or if we go to the <unk> mountains , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you see the <unk> face of political <unk> .
<unk> , the physical eradication of a people will be accused of being <unk> , but <unk> , the destruction of a human lifestyle , is not just not <unk> , but in many ways , in many ways , as part of a <unk> .
The pain of Tibet doesn &apos;t have to be contained , until you &apos;re sitting on the <unk> .
I had traveled with a young colleague of mine <unk> miles across land from <unk> to Cape Town .
It wasn &apos;t until when I came in <unk> , I understood the face of the statistics that you heard about .
6,000 <unk> <unk> , 1.2 million people killed during the Cultural Revolution .
My colleague &apos;s father was <unk> to the <unk> Lama .
On that basis , he was killed directly when the Chinese invasion started .
His uncle <unk> with the Dalai Lama in the Diaspora , who brought the people into Nepal .
His mother was <unk> because she was rich .
He was <unk> the prison when he was two , he <unk> under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t hold him without him .
And so the sister who had <unk> was stopped in a <unk> <unk>
One day , she had an accident at a <unk> of Mao . For these years , she had placed <unk> <unk> .
The pain of Tibet can be <unk> , but the <unk> minds of the people is something to be <unk> .
And finally , it comes down to a choice .
Are we going to embrace a gray world in a gray world ?
The great <unk> Margaret <unk> said for her death that they <unk> us towards a general , <unk> worldview .
We wouldn &apos;t just be limited to the human imagination until a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , but also we would be <unk> and forgot that there were other options .
We can <unk> ourselves into the idea that our species is just about 150,000 years on Earth .
The Cultural Revolution , which gave us agriculture , where we <unk> to the <unk> of the seed , when the poetry of the Critic was replaced by the <unk> of the <unk> , and we got a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , only 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrial world isn &apos;t yet 300 years old .
And I think this <unk> history doesn &apos;t give me the idea that we all have the answers to all the questions that will come on us .
If the <unk> cultures in the world are asked by the significance of <unk> , they will respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in that song that we will discover the potential to be what we are : a <unk> species , all of the <unk> species , all of the gardens of <unk> and all the gardens of optimism . There are great moments of optimism .
This photograph I took at the north section of <unk> Island , when I went on with <unk> on <unk> Island .
This man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Tunisian government didn &apos;t have a nice time for the Inuit ; in the 1950s , they were , in the &apos; 50s , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> refused to go .
The family fled for his life , and he <unk> all of his weapons , all of his tools .
Now you have to understand that the Inuit didn &apos;t fear for the cold ; they used to use it .
The <unk> of their <unk> were made of fish in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> wasn &apos;t afraid of the <unk> or the storm that <unk> .
He went out , he left his <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> in his hand . When the <unk> started , he formed it as a <unk> .
He brought a <unk> <unk> on the side of the knife .
When it was solid , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and he <unk> a <unk> .
From the <unk> he made a <unk> .
He was looking for a dog nearby , and he went on the <unk> , including <unk> .
In a way of talking to nothing . And this , in many ways , is a symbol for the <unk> of the Inuit and all indigenous peoples in the world .
April 1999 , in April 1999 , gave the Inuit <unk> <unk> of a piece of land , and Texas combined , it &apos;s our new home . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s independent region . They manage all the resources .
It &apos;s an amazing example of how a <unk> can offer to her people .
And finally , I think it &apos;s very clear , at least for those of you who are traveling at the world , that they don &apos;t really go far away .
They are somebody &apos;s <unk> .
They are standing on the <unk> of the human imagination , which goes back to the beginning of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like ours , are part of a <unk> <unk> of hope .
So what we &apos;re doing at the end of National Geographic is , by the way , that politicians never achieve anything .
We think that <unk> -- we think that a <unk> <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , so we probably will be the best <unk> in the world , and our website will be <unk> 35 million times a month , we &apos;re in <unk> countries on TV , and our journals find a <unk> .
We &apos;re making a travel trip to the <unk> , with our audience , to such extraordinary cultural places , where the <unk> <unk> so <unk> of what he sees , so hopefully , hopefully , the important revelation of the <unk> will be to be able to live in diversity , that we can find a way of living in a world , that we can find a way to live in a more meaningful and quiet world .
where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to us collectively .
Thank you very much .
I want to talk to you about a couple of issues I &apos;ve been devoted to recently .
Maybe you see <unk> information from other sources .
I &apos;m also trying to explain some connections that you may have missed .
I want to start the official dogma ,
To be precise : the official dogma of all the Western , industrialized societies ,
And that official <unk> is like this : to get the <unk> of our citizens at the highest level , we have to give them as much as individual freedom .
<unk> is a great part of the human condition .
Furthermore , freedom enables us to act on their own understanding , to achieve a higher level of information without <unk> <unk> .
The ultimate freedom , we find ourselves in <unk> .
More choices in people will have more freedom .
And more freedom means more wealth .
This is so deeply rooted in our society that no one would dare to doubt .
In our lives , this is <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to give you some examples of our modern <unk> .
This is my supermarket . A <unk> .
Let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
In addition to the 175 <unk> of <unk> , there are 10 different <unk> of <unk> <unk> and dozen different <unk> .
And you can make a lot of your own <unk> , for the case between those 175 species for you .
So that &apos;s the supply of my supermarket .
Look at <unk> . You can put yourself on your <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> .
If you can take a look at that one , you can choose from this number .
You can put up <unk> million different systems , with parts of that store .
Give you a lot of choice .
Another example -- communication .
When I was young , a long time ago , you could have all sorts of <unk> <unk> , but just with Ma Bell .
You <unk> the device . You didn &apos;t buy it .
And by the way , that had the advantage of the device , by the way , was not going to work .
That time is over .
Today , there are a lot of different devices .
especially in cell phones .
These are the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle -- that with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Maybe you haven &apos;t seen this model at the store , but you can surely be sure that it &apos;s going to happen soon .
The consequence : People come to the store and ask this question .
And you know what the answer to that question is ?
No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
And also , in aspects of the lives of life that are much more important than the <unk> of things , is this <unk> increase of choice .
<unk> -- it &apos;s not so much in the United States , so you &apos;re going to go to the doctor , and that tells you what to do .
No , you go to the doctor , and you say , &quot; We can do A , or we can do B .
A <unk> and <unk> .
B has these <unk> and <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> , what do you think ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; One has these <unk> and <unk> , and B has these <unk> and <unk> .
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> , if you were me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you . &quot;
And that &apos;s what we call &quot; patient <unk> of the patient . &quot;
That sounds very positive , but in fact , in fact , the hard task of making decisions is shifting from someone with the mind of things -- the doctor seems to be a pretty good person and don &apos;t have the best condition of making decisions -- the patient , for the prescription of <unk> drugs -- the patient for <unk> drugs .
It doesn &apos;t make any sense , because the <unk> , you and I can &apos;t buy it .
Why are they making advertising when we can &apos;t buy it ?
Because they think we &apos;re going to call our doctor our doctor next morning to ask that other brand medicine .
Our identity , yet , a <unk> aspect of our existence , is now <unk> of choice , as you can see on this slide .
Our identity is <unk> from our background .
We find ourselves out of -- so often we want to .
Every morning , you have to come up with what you want to be a person who you want to be .
Let &apos;s talk about marriage , the family .
And there &apos;s a time when everybody automatically comes out of all of us who were getting married as quickly as possible , and then as soon as possible , as soon as possible ,
The only real choice was with who , not when and what you did .
Now , all of a sudden , it &apos;s all for <unk> .
I &apos;m teaching a lot of other intelligent students , I teach you about 20 percent of your homework ,
They &apos;re not <unk> <unk> or <unk> than in the old days .
No , they worry about choices .
&quot; Will I get married ? Will I marry ? &quot;
Or will I wait for you ? Should I be children , or a career ? &quot;
These are <unk> questions .
They go through and they have an answer , even if this means they don &apos;t <unk> all the homework and they don &apos;t get a good grade .
And they &apos;re right . They &apos;re very important .
And then we &apos;re going to get at work . What Carl did is to work on us every minute of every day , anywhere in the world -- except in the world -- except in Randolph , of course .
There &apos;s one place , by the way , which I love , where <unk> does it .
I don &apos;t know where , because I want to love that place for myself .
But anyway , that huge <unk> of work in terms of work that we &apos;re asking and over again , and over time , we &apos;re going to work , or not .
We can look at a <unk> of our son , with our cell phones on the one hand , and our Blackberry on the other hand , and perhaps our laptop on lap tape .
And even if they &apos;re all out of each other , we &apos;re struggling every minute of the match , &quot; Will I answer this ? &quot;
Am I going to respond to this data ? Am I going to write this letter ? &quot;
And even if the answer &quot; No &quot; is , we experience the <unk> of our son in a very different way .
What we also look at , the big , the small , <unk> things , lifestyle : life is a matter of choice .
This is what the world used to look like .
There were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
And this is what the world looks like .
The question is : is this good or bad ?
And the answer is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
We all know what &apos;s going on , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s wrong .
And that huge <unk> has two effects , two negative effects on human beings .
And a really intriguing effect is that it &apos;s more <unk> than <unk> .
So , with so many <unk> people , people will find it difficult to make a choice .
I &apos;m going to give you a very dramatic example of a study of investment in voluntary decision-making .
A colleague of mine had access to <unk> <unk> , a huge deal of a million of these workers , about one million of them over 2,000 species .
And she found that for every 10 years , there was the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the involvement between the involvement of two percent .
Fifty years ago , there were 10 percent of the workforce than in five years . Why ?
Because it &apos;s so difficult to pick up the next funds to decide that people just <unk> the following day to the next day , and so on and so on .
And of course , of course , <unk> comes down .
And that doesn &apos;t only mean that those people who don &apos;t eat a dry bread after their <unk> bread , because they didn &apos;t put enough money on the side , but also the choice of the choice was so difficult that they were <unk> .
Then they left down to 5,000 dollars a year ,
Because the <unk> was willing to double their own <unk> .
So a lot of <unk> can work <unk> .
And I think the world looks like this .
When it comes to the <unk> , you want to make the right choice , right ?
You don &apos;t want to be <unk> with the right fund , or even the wrong <unk> .
And that &apos;s the first effect . The second effect is that we also , even though we <unk> the paralysis of ourselves , will be less happy with the outcome than we had had less options .
And there are several reasons for that .
One of them is , for example , there &apos;s a choice , for example , of course , of course , that the choice was not perfect .
You can imagine in such a case that another choice would have been better .
And this <unk> alternative makes you feel regret of your choice .
And regret is doing the fulfillment of the choices that you made , even if it was a good choice .
So the more options there are , the more easier it is to be <unk> , regardless of what element of choice .
A second reason has to do with <unk> .
And then Gilbert said this morning , how often we leave the value of things that we compare to the things that we compare .
If you can <unk> many alternatives , you can see quickly the <unk> sides of all the alternatives that you <unk> .
That makes you less happy with the alternative that you have chosen .
Let me give you an example . For the best of you : I &apos;m sorry .
This is a little bit of <unk> of this example .
This is a couple of weeks in vacation ,
They have an <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re on a lovely beach . Again , no human being in sight .
It doesn &apos;t seem better ? &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; thinking , &quot; It &apos;s August . &quot;
Everyone in my neighborhood in Manhattan is out there .
I could park my car right for the door . &quot;
And he &apos;s sitting down there for two weeks , with the idea that he had a wonderful <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are at the expense of the satisfaction that we have , even if we make a great choice .
the more possibilities there are , the more attractive alternatives there are .
And they &apos;re presenting us as <unk> .
Another example .
And this <unk> is hitting a number of points .
living in here and for example , and for instance , you don &apos;t have to <unk> things .
One more thing is , with each other , you have chosen other choices with each other .
And all of that other thing is that the <unk> side of it , which gives you the choice of the choice , is less attractive .
Third , there &apos;s the <unk> of expectations .
I came up with a <unk> of a new <unk> .
I almost wear <unk> .
It used to be a kind of <unk> , and you bought it . It didn &apos;t fit all of you , it was <unk> <unk> , but if you wore your pants long enough , it felt okay .
I went to the store for the next time ,
I said , &quot; Hey , I want a <unk> , this is my measurements . &quot;
And the <unk> said , &quot; Do you have smart fit , <unk> or fit ?
Are you crossing or a <unk> ? Are you <unk> or <unk> ?
Are you wearing a pair of shoes ?
If you were a little <unk> <unk> , or a lot of <unk> <unk> . &quot; And so he went on .
I was <unk> . After a while , I said , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want the only pair of pants there . &quot;
He had no idea what had a pair of pants , and so I spent an hour all possible <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s fair to be honest , I left the store with a very nice set of pants .
I &apos;d done better . And I could do better .
But I didn &apos;t feel better .
Why ? To explain this to me , I wrote a book .
And the reason I didn &apos;t feel much better about all that <unk> was that I started to expect more of the <unk> of a good audience .
I didn &apos;t have any expectation , because I knew I knew a kind of <unk> .
And then found that there were several , and one of them would be perfect .
What I bought was a good thing , but not perfect .
And so I compared my <unk> to my <unk> , and that was <unk> .
The more opportunities people have , the more expectations of the <unk> of those possibilities .
And that means people are less happy with outcomes , even if they &apos;re good results .
<unk> don &apos;t know this .
Because in that case , you didn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
And in real life , it &apos;s going on .
Everything was better when everything was worse .
Because when everything was worse , people could still have a surprising experience .
In our modern society , we may be <unk> citizens as <unk> citizens , but the best thing we can possibly achieve is if we had anticipated .
Never be surprised , because our expectations , my expectations , are <unk> .
And the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much <unk> .
I want to ask you here -- I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> -- that I &apos;m married with a woman who &apos;s really great .
I didn &apos;t have a happy deal with it .
But with less pleasure , there &apos;s a good side to me .
So , finally , when you buy a <unk> of <unk> <unk> if there &apos;s only one species available , you can ask yourself , why are you <unk> ?
And the answer is simple .
The world is responsible . Because you had no choice .
But if there are hundreds of different cell phones available , and you buy one of these that turns on , who is responsible ?
And the answer to that is just so simple . That &apos;s you .
You could make a better choice .
With hundreds of different <unk> , you don &apos;t have an excuse to fail .
So if people decide , even if the results of those decisions are good , they &apos;re disappointed about choice .
And they will blame themselves .
In Western societies , clinical depression <unk> among the younger generations ,
A factor -- not the only one , but a significant factor of that <unk> increase of depression and suicide , is so many of the times <unk> experience of your high expectations .
And if they try to explain those <unk> for themselves , they blame themselves .
So , the key thing is , we &apos;re going to have a <unk> <unk> , but we feel better .
Let me give you a quick summary .
This is the official dogma , all of us who are <unk> .
But that &apos;s not true .
It &apos;s not a doubt that there &apos;s a better choice than not to pick it up , but that doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s a better choice .
There &apos;s a magical frontier of <unk> , which I don &apos;t know .
But I know that we are all over a long time , that <unk> our well-being .
Now there &apos;s a principle -- I &apos;m almost finished -- a principle that we can love .
<unk> in industrialized countries are <unk> <unk> .
There are a lot of places around the world , and there &apos;s a lot of other people we &apos;ve heard about , where the problem is not so much , but there &apos;s not enough choice .
So the paradox that I &apos;m talking about here is particularly true for the modern , <unk> West .
And that &apos;s <unk> , and I think that Steve <unk> has told you yesterday that Steve <unk> has told you that expensive and difficult <unk> don &apos;t help .
I &apos;m telling you the same about these expensive , complicated choices -- they don &apos;t help .
They make our lives less .
As a matter of what people in our societies would be able to have been transmitted to countries where people have too little options , the life of those people will move forward .
And our lives would move forward .
That &apos;s what economists call a <unk> .
Everybody &apos;s getting better by wealth from wealth -- not just poor people -- and that &apos;s because of the burden of <unk> that we have with us .
And if you read this , and if you read this <unk> , you will say , &quot; Well , what does that fish do ?
Nothing is possible in a <unk> . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> worldview -- that was my first interpretation of it .
But the longer I thought about it , the more I understood , I understood that this fish is really smart .
Because in fact , there &apos;s this thing to hand : If you break down the <unk> to create opportunities , you don &apos;t have freedom , but paralysis .
If you break down the <unk> to create opportunities , you will be less happy .
It leads to more paralysis and less <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is practically <unk> -- possibly even for the fish , but certainly for us .
But the absence of an <unk> <unk> is asking you to ask yourself a little bit of misery , and , presumably , <unk> .
Thank you for your attention .
Vorig jaar liet ik deze twee dia \&apos; s zien die aantonen dat de <unk> <unk> , die in de afgelopen 3 miljoen jaar de grootte van de lagere 48 % is afgenomen , met 40 procent .
Maar dit <unk> de ernst van dit probleem omdat het <unk> van het ijs niet laat zien .
De <unk> <unk> is , in zekere zin , het <unk> hart van het wereldwijde klimaat .
Het <unk> in de winter en <unk> in de zomer .
De volgende dia die ik laat zien , zal een snelle <unk> zijn van wat er gebeurde in de afgelopen 25 jaar .
Het permanent ijs is rood .
Zoals je ziet , <unk> het zich naar de donker .
Dat is het jaarlijkse ijs in de winter .
Hij <unk> in de zomer .
Het zogenaamde permanent ijs , vijf jaar oud of ouder , je kunt zien bijna bloed , <unk> uit het lichaam .
In 25 jaar is het hiervan <unk> .
Dit is een probleem omdat de opwarming de bevroren grond rond de Arctic Oceaan <unk> , waar er een enorme hoeveelheid bevroren koolstof is die , als ze <unk> , naar methaan <unk> .
<unk> met de totale aantallen vervuiling in de atmosfeer , die bedrag kunnen verdubbelen als we dit <unk> .
In enkele <unk> in Alaska , is methaan actief <unk> uit het water .
Professor Walter <unk> van de Universiteit van Alaska ging met een ander team naar een ander <unk> in de winter .
Video : <unk> ! Al Gore : Ze is oké .
Een reden is , deze enorme <unk> die Groenland <unk> vanuit het noorden .
Dit is een <unk> <unk> .
Maar de <unk> zijn veel groter dan ooit .
Dit is de <unk> River in het <unk> van Groenland .
Als je wilt weten hoe de zeespiegel stijgt vanaf het <unk> ijs , is dit de zee <unk> .
Deze stromen sneller snel .
Aan het andere kant van de planeet , Antarctica de grootste massa ijs op de planeet .
Vorige maand <unk> wetenschappers het hele continent in negatieve <unk> .
En het westen Antarctica boven enkele <unk> eilanden , is bijzonder snel in het smelten van het smelten .
Dat is gelijk aan 20 meter hoogte , zoals Groenland .
In de Himalaya , de derde grootste massa van ijs : bovenaan zie je nieuwe meren , die een paar jaar geleden waren .
40 procent van alle mensen in de wereld krijgen de helft van hun drinkwater van die <unk> .
In de Andes , deze gletsjer is de bron van drinkwater voor deze stad .
De stromen zijn toegenomen .
Maar als ze weg gaan , dan doet het veel van het drinkwater .
In Californië was er een 40 procent daling in de Sierra <unk> .
Dit is de <unk> .
En de voorspellingen , zoals je leest , zijn serieus .
Dit <unk> over de hele wereld heeft geleid tot een dramatische toename in brand .
De rampen over de hele wereld hebben een absoluut bijzondere en ongekende snelheid .
Vier keer zoveel in de vorige 30 jaar in de vorige 30 jaar .
Dit is een volledig <unk> patroon .
Als je kijkt naar de context van de geschiedenis die je ziet .
In de afgelopen vijf jaar hebben we 70 miljoen ton CO2 verzameld .
25 miljoen ton naar de oceanen . Kijk goed naar het gebied van de oostelijke Stille Oceaan , van de Americas , en aan de zijkant van de Indische <unk> , waar er een radicale <unk> van zuurstof in de oceanen is .
De grootste oorzaak van opwarming van de aarde , samen met ontbossing , 20 procent daarvan , is het verbranden van fossiele brandstoffen .
<unk> is een probleem , en steenkool is het grootste probleem .
De Verenigde Staten is een van de twee grootste <unk> , samen met China .
Het voorstel was veel meer <unk> .
Maar we beginnen een <unk> .
Dit zijn degenen die in de afgelopen paar jaar <unk> zijn met enkele groene alternatieven .
Maar er is een politieke strijd in ons land .
De <unk> en de <unk> besteedden een kwart miljard dollar in het laatste <unk> jaar in het laatste <unk> jaar , een <unk> .
Dit beeld herinnerde me aan iets .
Rond Weihnachten in Tennessee in Tennessee , was een miljard liter <unk> <unk> .
Waarschijnlijk heb je het nieuws gezien .
Dit , overal in het land , is de tweede grootste <unk> in Amerika .
Dit gebeurde rond Weihnachten .
Een van de <unk> \&apos; s in <unk> was deze .

Heel erg bedankt .
Vorig jaar gaf ik bij TED een <unk> aan de LHC .
Ik beloofde me om terug te komen en je een update over hoe die machine werkte .
Dit is het . En voor degenen die daar niet waren , was de LHC het grootste wetenschappelijke experiment ooit geprobeerd -- 27 kilometers in <unk> .
Hun taak is om de condities te <unk> die minder dan een seconde lang zijn dan een <unk> van een seconde na het heelal , tot 600 miljoen keer per seconde .
Het is niet zo ambitieus .
Dit is de machine onder <unk> .
We nemen de foto \&apos; s van die <unk> <unk> in <unk> , dit is de <unk> detector , 44 meter breed , 22 meter breed in diameter .
<unk> foto \&apos; s van <unk> onder de bouw , zodat je de schaal kunt zien .
Op de <unk> van september vorig jaar werd we de machine voor het eerst <unk> .
Deze foto werd genomen door <unk> .
Het veroorzaakte enorme <unk> in de <unk> .
Het is een foto van het eerste <unk> die rond de LHC <unk> , met een deel van de LHC , en <unk> deeltjes in de detector .
Met andere woorden , toen we die foto \&apos; s zagen op september van de 10. eeuw , wisten we dat de machine werkte , een grote <unk> .
Ik weet niet of dit de grootste <unk> was , of dit , toen iemand naar Google ging en de voorpagina zag .
Het betekent dat we culturele invloed en wetenschappelijke effecten hebben gemaakt .
Een week later hadden we een probleem met de machine , gerelateerd aan deze stukjes draad hier -- deze gouden draden .
Die draden vervoeren 13 duizend <unk> wanneer de machine werkt in volle energie .
De ingenieurs onder jullie zullen ernaar kijken en zeggen : &quot; Nee , ze niet . Ze zijn kleine draden . &quot;
Ze kunnen dat doen , want als ze zeer koud zijn , dan zijn ze <unk> <unk> .
Dus in min 40 graden kouder , dan kouder dan de ruimte tussen de sterren , die de stroom kunnen nemen .
In een van de verbindingen tussen over 9.000 <unk> in de LHC , was er een <unk> .
Dus de draad <unk> een beetje , en de <unk> <unk> plotseling elektrisch verzet .
Dit was het resultaat .
Dat is nog interessanter als je die <unk> over 20 ton , en ze bewegen over een voet .
We <unk> ongeveer 50 van de <unk> .
We moesten ze eruit halen , wat we deden .
We <unk> ze allemaal , <unk> ze .
Ze staan op hun weg in hun weg .
Tegen het einde van Mars zal de LHC weer intact blijven .
We zullen het aanzetten , en we verwachten data in juni of juli , en doorgaan met onze zoektocht naar de bouwstenen van het universum .
Natuurlijk , op een manier die het debat <unk> over de waarde van wetenschap en techniek , dan is het gemakkelijk om te <unk> .
Ik denk dat het feit dat het zo moeilijk is , het feit dat we <unk> zijn , is de waarde van zaken als de LHC .
Ik zal het laatste woord voor een Engelse wetenschapper , <unk> <unk> , die , volgens mij , niet <unk> zijn - zijn <unk> was Michael <unk> -- zei dit : &quot; Niets is zo gevaarlijk voor de vooruitgang van de menselijke geest , dat onze <unk> <unk> zijn , en dat er geen nieuwe werelden zijn om te <unk> . &quot;
Dank u .
Ik wil beginnen met je te gaan denken als je een kind was , met <unk> .
Als je erachter kwam hoe je <unk> en <unk> <unk> , dan heb je geleerd hoe te denken en problemen te oplossen door te begrijpen en te manipuleren en <unk> te manipuleren .
<unk> redeneren is diep verbonden met hoe we veel kunnen begrijpen .
Als <unk> geïnspireerd door onze interacties met fysieke objecten -- samen met mijn <unk> <unk> , en mijn medewerker <unk> <unk> -- ik begon af te vragen -- wat als we een computer hadden <unk> , in plaats van een <unk> <unk> , wat als we in contact kwamen met beide handen en <unk> .
<unk> de manier waarop we wilden ?
Deze vraag was zo overtuigend dat we besloten om het antwoord te onderzoeken , door <unk> te bouwen .
Kortom , een <unk> is een <unk> computer de grootte van een <unk> .
Ze kunnen in staat zijn om met hand te bewegen , ze kunnen elkaar voelen , ze kunnen hun beweging voelen , en een scherm en een draadloze radio .
Het belangrijkste : ze zijn fysiek , zoals de blokken , je kunt ze bewegen door <unk> en <unk> .
<unk> zijn een voorbeeld van een nieuw ecosysteem van werktuigen om digitale informatie te manipuleren .
Terwijl deze tools meer fysiek , zich bewust zijn van hun beweging , zich bewust van elkaar en bewust van hoe we ze bewegen , kunnen we beginnen met nieuwe en leuke interactie .
Ik ga beginnen met enkele simpele voorbeelden .
Deze <unk> is <unk> om video te laten zien , en als ik het in één richting zet , zal het de video op deze manier rollen , als ik het de andere kant <unk> .
Deze interactieve portretten zijn bewust van elkaar .
Dus als ik ze naast elkaar zet , worden ze geïnteresseerd .
Als ze omringd raken , merken ze dat ze een beetje <unk> krijgen .
Ze kunnen ook hun beweging voelen en <unk> .
Een van de interessante implicaties over interactie , we begonnen te beseffen , was dat we alledaagse gebaren konden gebruiken , zoals we een <unk> zouden kunnen <unk> .
In dit geval hebben we drie <unk> <unk> om <unk> te schilderen en ik kan ze gebruiken om kleur in die centrale , waar ze <unk> .
Als we <unk> , kunnen we een beetje <unk> .
Er zijn ook een paar leuke mogelijkheden voor onderwijs , zoals taal , wiskunde en logica waar we mensen de mogelijkheid geven om snel te proberen , en de resultaten onmiddellijk bekijken .
Ik ben hier - Dit is een <unk> die ik maak met een eenvoudig <unk> .
Hier hebben we een \&apos; <unk> \&apos; <unk> tussen <unk> en <unk> .
In elke ronde <unk> krijg je een willekeurige letter op elk <unk> , en terwijl je probeert woorden te maken , gaat het tegen een woordenboek .
Daarna , na 30 seconden , <unk> , en je hebt een nieuwe set letters en nieuwe mogelijkheden om te proberen .
Dank u .
Dit zijn een paar kinderen die een <unk> naar het Media Lab , en ik heb ze erin gezet om het te proberen , en een video te nemen .
Ze liebten het echt .
Een van de interessante dingen over deze toepassing is dat je geen mensen veel instructies geeft .
Je hoeft alleen maar te zeggen : &quot; Gebruik woorden , en ze weten precies wat ze moeten doen . &quot;
Hier zijn een paar mensen die het eruit proberen .
Dat is onze jongste <unk> , daar rechts .
Het bleek dat alles wat hij wilde doen , de <unk> <unk> .
Voor hem waren ze gewoon blokken .
Dit is een interactieve <unk> .
We wilden een leerproces bouwen voor <unk> .
Dit is <unk> .
Hij kan nieuwe personages in de scène brengen , alleen door de <unk> van de tafel die het personage toonde aan hen .
Hier brengt hij de zon op .
Video : De zon stijgt .
David <unk> : Hij heeft een <unk> in de scène gezet .
Video : De oranje <unk> .
Goed gedaan ! Ja !
DM : Door de <unk> te schudden en ze naast elkaar te brengen , kan hij de personages interageren -- Video : <unk> !
DM : uitvinden zijn eigen verhaal .
Video : Hallo !
DM : Het is een open verhaal .
Hij moet beslissen hoe het zich <unk> .
Video : <unk> weg , kat .
DM : Het laatste voorbeeld die ik jullie vandaag heb laten zien , is een <unk> en live <unk> die we recent hebben gemaakt , waarin <unk> , <unk> en <unk> .
Elk van deze heeft vier verschillende variaties , je moet kiezen welke je wilt gebruiken .
Je kunt deze geluiden injecteren in een sequentie die je kunt <unk> in het patroon die je wilt <unk> .
En je kunt het injecteren door het geluid <unk> tegen een <unk> . Er zijn effecten die je kunt beheersen live , zoals <unk> en filter .
Je <unk> het aan een bepaald geluid en dan tilt je het aan .
En dan , algemene effecten , zoals tempo en volume die op de hele sequentie passen .
Laten we eens kijken .
Video : DM : We gaan beginnen met een <unk> in twee <unk> , en <unk> ze in een serie , uitbreiden en <unk> .
Ik heb een <unk> <unk> .
Video : DM : Ik zal wat <unk> .
Video : DM : Ik draag de filter aan de <unk> , zodat ik het effect heb <unk> .
Video : DM : Ik kan de hele sequentie versnellen door de snelheid of de ander .
Video : DM : Ik zal de filter <unk> naar de <unk> voor meer expressie .
Video : DM : Ik kan de volgorde <unk> terwijl het speelt .
Ik hoef het niet vooraf te plannen , maar ik kan het improviseren , ik kan het langer of korter maken als ik ga .
Tot slot kan ik de hele sequentie <unk> met het volume van het volume , <unk> naar links .
Dank u .
Zoals je kunt zien , is mijn passie voor het maken van nieuwe <unk> interfaces die een betere overeenkomst hebben met hoe onze hersenen en lichamen werken .
Vandaag heb ik tijd om jullie een punt te laten zien in deze nieuwe <unk> , en een paar mogelijkheden die we aan het laboratorium <unk> .
Dus de gedachte die ik jullie wil meegeven , is dat we aan de <unk> van deze nieuwe generatie tools die we met digitale media in onze wereld kunnen overbrengen .
Heel erg bedankt .
Ik kijk ernaar om met jullie te praten .
Ik ben schrijver .
<unk> boeken zijn mijn beroep , maar het is meer dan dat , natuurlijk .
Het is ook mijn grote levenslange liefde en <unk> . Ik verwacht niet dat dat ooit zal veranderen .
Maar , dat zei , ik heb iets <unk> in mijn leven en in mijn carrière , die me mijn hele gesprek moet <unk> met dit werk .
Het bijzondere is dat ik recentelijk dit boek schreef : &quot; <unk> , <unk> , Love &quot; in tegenstelling tot een van mijn vorige boeken , in de wereld voor enkele reden , en een grote , <unk> , internationale <unk> .
Het resultaat is dat overal ik mensen <unk> , zoals ik <unk> ben .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
Ze komen nu op me af , allemaal ongerust en zeggen : &quot; <unk> je niet bang dat je daar nooit in staat bent ?
Laat je niet bang zijn voor je hele leven en je zal nooit opnieuw een boek schrijven die iemand in de wereld <unk> .
Ooit ? &quot;
Dat is dus <unk> , weet je wel .
Maar het zou nog erger zijn , behalve dat ik me in 20 jaar tijd herinner , toen ik een tiener was , toen ik begon met mensen die ik een schrijver wilde worden , met dezelfde reactie .
En mensen zeiden : &quot; <unk> je niet bang ?
<unk> je niet bang voor de vernedering van <unk> ?
Ik ben niet bang dat je je hele leven zal gaan werken in dit voertuig en daar nooit zal komen , en je gaat dood in een <unk> <unk> van <unk> dromen met je mond vol <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Dat weet je wel .
Het antwoord -- het korte antwoord op al die vragen is : &quot; Ja . &quot;
Ja , ik ben bang voor die dingen .
Ik ben altijd geweest .
Ik ben bang voor vele , vele dingen naast mensen kunnen niet eens raden .
Zoals <unk> en andere dingen die eng zijn .
Maar wanneer het gaat over het schrijven , het ding waarover ik recentelijk dacht , en recentelijk heb ik het afgevraagd .
Waarom ?
Het is logisch dat iemand moet worden verwacht om bang te zijn voor het werk dat ze op deze aarde <unk> .
En het gaat specifiek over creatieve <unk> die ons echt nerveus hebben over de geestelijke gezondheid in een manier die een andere carrière niet doet , weet je wel ?
Zoals mijn vader , bijvoorbeeld , was een chemisch ingenieur , en ik herinner me niet eens eens in zijn 40 jaar chemische manipulatie die iemand had <unk> of een chemische ingenieur .
&quot; Dat <unk> <unk> , John , hoe gaat het ? &quot;
Het kwam gewoon niet zo op .
Maar om eerlijk te zijn , <unk> chemische ingenieurs als een groep die niet meer een reputatie heeft verdiend aan <unk> <unk> .
We hebben een soort van die reputatie .
Niet alleen maar schrijvers , maar creatieve mensen in alle <unk> , het lijkt op een enorm geestelijke <unk> .
Alles wat je moet doen , is in de 20ste eeuw , alleen in de 20ste eeuw , van echt <unk> creatieve geesten .
Ze stierven jong en vaak in hun eigen handen .
Zelfs degenen die zelfmoord niet plegen met hun <unk> , lijken wel <unk> te zijn .
Norman <unk> , net voor hij overleed , vorige interview , zei : &quot; Elk van mijn boeken heeft me een beetje meer gedood . &quot;
Een bijzondere uitspraak om het werk van het werk te doen .
Maar we gaan niet eens <unk> als we dit horen .
We hebben dat al zo lang gehoord en op een of andere manier <unk> en <unk> .
Dit idee dat creativiteit en lijden inherent verbonden zijn en dat <unk> , uiteindelijk , leidt tot <unk> .
De vraag die ik jullie vandaag wil stellen , is jullie allemaal <unk> met dat idee ?
Ben je je daar ?
Want je kijkt ernaar naar een <unk> en , weet je , ik ben niet <unk> met die veronderstelling .
Ik denk dat het <unk> is .
Ik denk ook dat het gevaarlijk is .
Ik wil het niet zien in de volgende eeuw .
Ik denk dat het beter is als we onze grote creatieve geest <unk> .
Ik weet zeker dat , in mijn geval , in mijn geval -- het zou heel gevaarlijk zijn voor mij die het donker pad <unk> .
Ik ben vooral in het geval van de omstandigheden waar ik in mijn carrière zit .
Wat -- weet je , zoals ik check , ben ik heel jong , ik ben maar zo jong , ik ben maar 40 jaar oud .
Ik heb nog vier decennia werk werk in me .
Het is <unk> waarschijnlijk dat alles wat ik aan dit punt schrijf , zal worden beoordeeld door de wereld als het werk dat na het <unk> succes was , niet ?
Ik moet het gewoon <unk> , want we zijn allemaal vrienden hier - het is <unk> waarschijnlijk dat mijn grootste succes achter me ligt .
Dus Jezus , wat een gedachte !
Dat is het idee dat een persoon die een persoon zou kunnen leiden om <unk> om 9 uur \&apos; s nachts te drinken .
Ik wil daar niet naartoe .
Ik zou de voorkeur geven aan het werk die ik leuk vind .
En daarom wordt de vraag hoe ?
Het lijkt mij , op veel <unk> wijze , de manier waarop ik nu moet werken , om te schrijven , is dat ik een soort beschermende psychologische constructie nodig heb .
Ik moet een manier vinden om een veilige afstand tussen mij te hebben , zoals ik schrijf , en mijn natuurlijke angst over wat de reactie op die van het schrijven zal worden , nu .
Ik ben in het afgelopen jaar geweest , voor modellen voor hoe het moet .
Ik ben min of meer geweest , en ik heb geprobeerd om andere samenlevingen te vinden om te zien of ze misschien beter en <unk> ideeën hebben , dan hoe we moeten helpen om creatieve risico \&apos; s te beheren .
Die zoektocht leidde me naar oude Griekenland en <unk> Rome .
Blijf me blijven , want het draait om en terug .
Maar oude Griekenland en <unk> Rome -- mensen die niet geloofden dat creativiteit terugkwam van menselijke wezens .
Mensen geloofden dat creativiteit een <unk> <unk> was die naar mens kwam vanuit een verre en <unk> bron , om ver en <unk> redenen .
De Grieken noemen deze <unk> <unk> geesten van creativiteit \&apos; <unk> \&apos; .
<unk> , bekend als <unk> , geloofde ik dat hij een <unk> had die wijsheid had <unk> .
De <unk> had hetzelfde idee .
Ze noemden het een <unk> creatieve geest die een genie was .
Dat was geweldig , want de <unk> geloofden niet dat een genie een bijzonder slim individu was .
Ze geloofden dat een genie was , een soort magische <unk> <unk> , die letterlijk in de muren van een kunstenaar leefde .
Een beetje <unk> .
Wie kwam eruit en <unk> de kunstenaar met hun werk .
Het resultaat was de uitkomst van dat werk .
Zo briljant -- daar zie je de afstand die ik heb <unk> -- die psychologische constructie om je te beschermen tegen de resultaten van je werk .
En iedereen wist dat dit hoe het <unk> , toch ?
De oude kunstenaar werd beschermd door bepaalde dingen , bijvoorbeeld , te veel <unk> , toch ?
Als jouw werk briljant was , kon je niet alle <unk> <unk> .
Iedereen wist dat je een <unk> genie had .
Als je werk <unk> , dan weet je niet helemaal jouw schuld .
Iedereen wist dat je <unk> was .
Dit is hoe mensen denken aan creativiteit in het Westen voor een heel lange tijd .
Toen kwam de Renaissance en veranderde alles .
We hadden een grote idee , en het grote idee was , laten we de individuele mens staan in het centrum van het heelal boven alle goden en mysteries .
Er is geen zaal voor <unk> wezens die <unk> nemen van het <unk> .
Het is het begin van rationeel <unk> .
Mensen begonnen te geloven dat creativiteit volkomen <unk> was .
En voor het eerst in de geschiedenis , begin je mensen te horen die naar dit verwijzen of die kunstenaar als genie zijn , in plaats van een genie .
Ik moest zeggen , ik denk dat dat een enorme fout was .
Weet je , ik denk dat iemand , een simpele persoon om te geloven dat hij of zij , zoals het <unk> en de essentie en de bron van alle <unk> , een <unk> , <unk> mysterie , <unk> mysterie heeft <unk> om een <unk> , menselijke psyche te <unk> .
Het is alsof iemand de zon <unk> .
Het is volledig <unk> en <unk> <unk> , en het creëert al deze <unk> verwachtingen over prestaties .
Ik denk dat de druk die onze kunstenaars al de afgelopen 500 jaar <unk> .
En , als dit waar is , en ik denk dat het waar is , wordt de vraag , wat nu ?
Kunnen we dit anders doen ?
Misschien gaan we terug naar een <unk> begrip van de relatie tussen mens en het creatieve mysterie .
Misschien niet .
Misschien kunnen we niet slechts 500 jaar <unk> denken in een <unk> minuten in een <unk> minuten .
Er zijn waarschijnlijk mensen in dit publiek die echt <unk> wetenschappelijke <unk> <unk> over het idee van mensen die mensen rond <unk> <unk> <unk> op hun projecten en dingen .
Ik ben er waarschijnlijk niet , het zal jullie allemaal meenemen .
Maar de vraag die ik wil stellen is ...
Waarom niet ?
Waarom denk je daar niet op deze manier ?
Want het klinkt zo <unk> als ik ooit heb gehoord in termen van het <unk> <unk> van het creatieve proces .
Een proces die , zoals iemand die ooit heeft geprobeerd om iets te doen -- wat iedereen hier doet , weet niet altijd <unk> .
Ik had een <unk> <unk> .
Ik ontmoette de bijzondere Amerikaanse dichter <unk> Stone .
Hij zit nu in haar 90s , maar ze was een dichter .
Ze vertelde me dat toen ze in landelijke Virginia opgroeide .
Ze werkte in de velden , en zei dat ze een gedicht zou voelen en een gedicht van het landschap <unk> .
Ze zei dat het een <unk> trein was .
Het kwam terug bij haar in het landschap .
Ze vond het <unk> , want het zou de aarde <unk> onder haar voeten . Ze wist dat ze maar één ding moest doen , en dat was , in haar woorden , &quot; <unk> de hel &quot; .
Ze rende naar het huis en werd <unk> door dit gedicht , en het hele deal was dat ze naar een blad papier moest komen .
Ik vroeg snel dat wanneer ze <unk> , ze het kon verzamelen en op de pagina <unk> .
En soms zou ze niet snel genoeg zijn .
Ze rende en rennen , en ze zou niet naar het huis komen .
Het gedicht zou <unk> , en ze <unk> het en zei dat het zou blijven over het landschap , terwijl ze het een andere dichter <unk> .
Toen was er een keer -- dit is het werk die ik nooit vergat -- ze zei dat er momenten waar ze het bijna <unk> , toch ?
Ze loopt naar het huis en kijkt naar het papier en het gedicht <unk> <unk> .
Ze grijpt een potlood aan terwijl ze <unk> .
Toen zei ze , het was alsof ze met haar andere hand <unk> en ze <unk> .
Ze <unk> het gedicht door de staart , en <unk> ze in haar lichaam terwijl ze op de pagina stond .
In deze gevallen kwam het gedicht perfect en intact , maar achteruit , van het laatste woord naar de eerste .
Toen ik hoorde dat ik -- dat is <unk> , dat is precies wat mijn creatieve proces is .
Dat is niet wat mijn creatieve proces is -- ik ben niet de <unk> !
Ik ben een <unk> , en de manier waarop ik moet werken , is dat ik elke dag , en zweet en <unk> en <unk> <unk> .
Maar zelfs ik , in mijn <unk> , heb ik soms <unk> tegen dat ding .
Ik stel me voor dat jullie een hoop van jullie hebben . Weet je , ik had werk of het werk van een bron die ik echt niet kon identificeren .
En wat is dat ding ?
Hoe we ermee omgaan met een manier die ons niet zal verliezen .
Maar in feite kunnen we ons gezond houden ?
Voor mij , het beste <unk> voorbeeld dat ik heb kunnen doen , is de muzikant van Tom <unk> .
Ik ben enkele jaren geleden van een <unk> van een <unk> .
We praatten hierover .
Weet je , Tom , voor het grootste deel van zijn leven , was een beetje de <unk> van de <unk> moderne kunstenaar , om te controleren en te beheersen en te beheren en te domineren en te domineren .
Toen werd hij ouder , hij werd <unk> .
Op een dag reed hij in Los Angeles in Los Angeles , en dit is toen het allemaal voor hem veranderde .
Hij versnelt , en opeens hoor hij een <unk> <unk> .
Dat komt in zijn hoofd als inspiratie , <unk> en <unk> .
Hij wil het , het is mooi .
Hij <unk> ernaar , maar hij heeft geen manier om het te krijgen .
Hij heeft geen papier , of een potlood , of een <unk> .
Hij begint al die oude angst te <unk> in hem als : &quot; Ik zal dit ding verliezen , en ik zal <unk> worden door dit liedje .
Ik ben niet goed genoeg , en ik kan het niet doen . &quot;
In plaats van <unk> , stopte hij met een <unk> proces en deed een volledig nieuw proces .
Hij keek naar de hemel en zei : &quot; Pardon , kan je niet zien dat ik rijden ? &quot;
&quot; Ziet ik eruit ?
Als je echt wilt bestaan , kom ik terug in een <unk> moment als ik voor jou kan zorgen .
Anders gaan we iemand anders .
Ga Leonard Cohen <unk> . \&apos; Zijn hele werk <unk> daarna .
Niet het werk , het werk was vaak zo donker als ooit .
Maar het proces , en de zware angst om het te <unk> was toen hij de geest nam , het genie van hem .
waar het niet alleen maar problemen was , en <unk> het terug waar het vandaan kwam .
Ik realiseerde me dat dit niet een <unk> moest zijn .
Het zou een vreemde , wonderlijke en bizarre samenwerking kunnen zijn , een gesprek tussen Tom en het vreemde , <unk> ding dat niet recht was .
Toen ik dat verhaal hoorde ...
Ik werkte toen , en dit idee had me al <unk> .
Het heeft me gered toen ik in het midden van het boek stond , &quot; <unk> , Love &quot; .
Ik <unk> een van die <unk> .
Ik zal allemaal vallen als we aan iets gaan doen en het niet <unk> en je gaat denken dat dit een ramp zal worden , het ergste boek ooit .
Niet alleen slecht , maar het ergste boek ooit .
Ik begon te denken dat ik dit project moest <unk> .
Toen herinnerde ik me Tom <unk> met de open lucht en probeerde het .
Ik <unk> mijn gezicht <unk> en legde mijn reacties op een lege hoek van de zaal .
Ik zei <unk> : &quot; Luister je , jij en ik weten dat als dit boek niet briljant is dat niet helemaal mijn schuld is , toch ?
Want je kunt zien dat ik alles heb <unk> .
Ik heb er geen meer dan dit .
Als je wil dat het beter zijn , moet je <unk> en je deel van de deal <unk> .
Maar als je dat niet doet , weet je wat , met de hel .
Ik ga toch toch schrijven want dat is mijn werk .
Ik zou graag willen dat de plaat vandaag de dag <unk> die ik aan mijn werk <unk> . &quot;
Want ... want het is zo ... OK ...
eeuwen geleden werden in de <unk> van Noord-Afrika , <unk> <unk> van heilige dans en muziek <unk> .
Dat duurde urenlang , tot <unk> .
Ze waren altijd geweldig , want de dansers waren <unk> en waren geweldig , toch ?
Maar elke keer , in een <unk> , zou er iets gebeuren .
Een van deze artiesten werden <unk> .
Ik weet waar ik het over heb , want ik weet dat jullie allemaal hebben gezien , op een bepaald punt in je leven .
Het was alsof je een dergelijke voorstelling zou stoppen , en de <unk> zou een soort <unk> <unk> .
Hij deed niets anders dan ooit , 1.000 nachten daarvoor , maar alles zou passen .
En opeens zou hij niet meer menselijk zijn .
Hij zou <unk> , en <unk> van beneden .
Allemaal <unk> met <unk> .
Toen dit gebeurde , toen mensen het wisten voor wat het was , dan noemden ze het <unk> <unk> en <unk> : &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God , God , God . &quot;
Dat is God , weet je wel .
<unk> historische <unk> : toen de <unk> in het zuiden <unk> , maakten ze een <unk> met hen .
De <unk> veranderde over de eeuwen \&apos; Allah , Allah , Allah , <unk> \&apos; , \&apos; <unk> , <unk> \&apos; .
Je hoort nog steeds in <unk> en in <unk> <unk> .
In Spanje , toen een artiest iets onmogelijke en magie deed : &quot; Allah , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> &quot; ,
<unk> , daar is een glimp van God .
Dat is geweldig , want we hebben dat nodig .
Maar het lastige stuk komt de volgende ochtend , voor de <unk> zelf , als hij wakker wordt en <unk> dat hij om 11 uur \&apos; s nachts wakker wordt .
Hij is alleen maar een <unk> <unk> met zeer lage knieën , en misschien zal hij nooit meer <unk> .
Misschien zal niemand ooit de naam van God <unk> terwijl hij draait .
En wat is hij dan met de rest van zijn leven ?
Dit is moeilijk .
Dit is een van de meest pijnlijke <unk> om in een creatief leven te geraken .
Maar misschien moet het niet zo vol zijn <unk> .
Als je nog nooit gelooft , als je nog nooit gelooft , dan is de meest bijzondere aspecten van je afkomstig .
Maar misschien denk je dat ze een lening van een <unk> bron van een <unk> bron van je leven <unk> .
Als je klaar bent met iemand die je klaar bent met iemand .
En , weet je , als we erover nadenken , dan begint het alles te veranderen .
Dit is hoe ik begon te denken .
Dit is zeker hoe ik in de afgelopen paar maanden denk aan het boek dat binnenkort gepubliceerd zal worden .
Zoals de gevaarlijk , <unk> <unk> ...
Ik moet zeggen dat ik mezelf moet blijven vertellen als ik echt <unk> ben .
Wees niet <unk> . Doe je werk .
<unk> om je werk te tonen , wat het misschien zou kunnen zijn .
Als je taak gaat dansen , maak je dans .
Als het <unk> , <unk> genie <unk> aan jouw zaak , besloot je een <unk> te <unk> , voor een moment in je pogingen , dan &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
En niet , doe je <unk> <unk> .
En &quot; <unk> ! &quot; aan jou , toch ?
Ik geloof dat we het moeten onderwijzen .
\&apos; <unk> ! \&apos; , voor jou , alleen maar voor de pure menselijke liefde en <unk> om te blijven zien .
Dank u .
Dank u .
June Cohen : <unk> !
Ik heb gesproken over enkele van deze projecten -- over het menselijk genoom en wat dat zou betekenen , en ontdekken nieuwe sets van genen .
We beginnen een nieuw punt : we zijn biologie <unk> , en nu proberen we te beginnen van die digitale code in een nieuwe fase met het ontwerpen van het ontwerpen en het <unk> .
We hebben altijd geprobeerd om grote vragen te stellen .
&quot; Wat is het leven ? &quot; Ik denk dat veel biologen die ik hebben geprobeerd op verschillende niveaus .
We hebben verschillende benaderingen geprobeerd , <unk> naar minimale onderdelen .
We hebben het nu al bijna 20 jaar <unk> .
Toen we het menselijk genoom <unk> , kwam het van de analoge wereld van de biologie in de digitale wereld van de computer .
Nu proberen we te vragen : &quot; Kunnen we leven regenereren of kunnen we nieuw leven uit dit digitale universum ? &quot;
Dit is de kaart van een klein organisme , <unk> <unk> , het kleinste genoom voor een soort die in het laboratorium kan <unk> .
We hebben geprobeerd om te kijken naar een nog kleinere genoom .
We kunnen in staat zijn om de orde van 100 genen uit de 500 of zo te bepalen .
Als we naar zijn <unk> kaart kijken , is het relatief eenvoudig vergeleken met onze ...
Geloof me , dit is eenvoudig .
Maar als we naar alle genen kijken die we een <unk> kunnen <unk> , dan is het zeer onwaarschijnlijk dat dit een levende cel zou opleveren .
Dus besloten we de enige manier om dit chromosoom te <unk> , zodat we de onderdelen konden <unk> om een aantal fundamentele vragen te stellen .
Dus we begonnen met de weg : kunnen we een chromosoom <unk> ?
Kan de chemie <unk> die we nog nooit eerder hebben gezien ?
Als we dat doen , kunnen we een chromosoom opstarten ?
Een chromosoom , trouwens , is een stukje inert chemisch materiaal .
Ons tempo van ons tempo heeft een exponentieel tempo toenemen .
Ons vermogen om de genetische code te schrijven , is behoorlijk langzaam , maar <unk> .
Ons laatste punt zou het een exponentiële curve hebben .
We begonnen dit met 15 jaar geleden .
Het duurde een aantal fasen in een <unk> voordat we de eerste experimenten deden .
Het blijkt dat het <unk> heel moeilijk is .
Er zijn tienduizenden machines over de hele wereld die kleine stukjes DNA maken -- 30 tot 50 letters in lengte -- en het langer , hoe langer je het stuk maakt , hoe meer fouten er zijn .
Dus moesten we een nieuwe methode maken om deze kleine stukken samen te voegen en alle fouten te corrigeren .
Dit was onze eerste poging met de digitale informatie van het genoom van <unk> <unk> .
Het is een klein virus dat bacteriën doodt .
We hebben de stukjes ontworpen en <unk> <unk> .
Een <unk> van ongeveer 5000 letters .
De spannende fase kwam toen we dit stuk <unk> chemische stof namen en de bacteriën begonnen deze genetische code te lezen , met de virale deeltjes .
De <unk> werden toen <unk> uit de cellen en de <unk> <unk> .
Ik sprak onlangs met de <unk> en zei dat ze het model begrepen .
Ze lachten meer dan jullie .
We denken dat dit een situatie is waarbij de software een eigen hardware kan bouwen in een biologisch systeem .
Maar we wilden veel groter .
We wilden het gehele bacteriële chromosoom bouwen .
Het gaat over <unk> letters van genetische code .
We dachten dat we ze zouden bouwen in de grootte van de virussen zodat we de <unk> konden <unk> .
Ik begrijp de echte onderdelen van een levende cel .
Design is cruciaal en als je begint met digitale informatie in de computer , die digitale informatie echt nauwkeurig moet zijn .
Toen we dit genoom in 1995 <unk> , was de vergelijking van nauwkeurigheid 1 <unk> per 10.000 <unk> .
We ontdekten , op het <unk> , 30 fouten , hadden we die oorspronkelijke volgorde nooit in staat geweest .
Een deel van het ontwerp ontwerpt onderdelen die 50 letters lang kunnen <unk> met alle andere <unk> die we moeten <unk> , zodat ze samen kunnen ontwerpen .
We ontwerpen er unieke elementen in .
Misschien hebben jullie gelezen dat we <unk> <unk> .
Denk aan dit : we hebben een <unk> genetische code -- A , C , G en T.
<unk> van die <unk> voor bijna 20 aminozuren , zodat er een enkele letter <unk> voor elk van de aminozuren .
We kunnen de genetische code gebruiken om woorden , zinnen , gedachten te schrijven .
<unk> , we deden het allemaal <unk> .
Sommige mensen waren teleurgesteld .
We hebben deze stukken ontworpen zodat we kunnen <unk> met <unk> .
Er zijn <unk> die ze herstellen en ze <unk> .
We begonnen met onderdelen , begonnen met stukken die 5000 tot 7000 letters waren , die samen kwamen om <unk> stukken te maken , waarna ze die <unk> <unk> .
In ieder stadium , we hebben deze stukjes in overvloed in overvloed , zodat we ze konden <unk> , want we proberen een proces te creëren die extreem robuust is .
We proberen het <unk> te bereiken .
Dit lijkt op een <unk> .
Als we in deze zeer grote stukjes meer dan 100.000 <unk> krijgen , dan zullen ze niet langer groeien in E. <unk> .
Het <unk> alle moderne materialen van moleculaire biologie .
We keerden naar andere mechanismen .
We wisten dat er een mechanisme genaamd <unk> <unk> die biologie gebruikt om <unk> te herstellen .
Hier een voorbeeld .
Er is een organisme genaamd <unk> <unk> die drie miljoen <unk> kan <unk> .
Je kunt zien in het bovenste plaatje , dat zijn chromosoom <unk> .
Snel tot 24 uur later , het zette het terug bij het <unk> .
We hebben duizenden organismen die dit kunnen doen .
Deze organismen kunnen volledig <unk> zijn .
Ze kunnen in een vacuüm leven .
Ik ben er zeker van dat het leven in de ruimte kan bestaan , bewegen , een nieuw <unk> omgeving .
NASA heeft daar veel van gezien .
Dit is een <unk> van het molecuul die we bouwden met behulp van deze processen , met het juiste ontwerp , met het juiste ontwerp van de stukken die we erin <unk> .
De gist <unk> ze automatisch .
Dit is geen <unk> ; dit is een gewone <unk> .
Het is zo \&apos; n groot molecuul die we kunnen zien met een <unk> .
Dit zijn foto \&apos; s over een <unk> periode .
Dit is een <unk> die we hadden <unk> .
Dit is over <unk> letters van genetische code .
Het is het grootste molecuul ooit gemaakt door mensen van een <unk> structuur .
Het is meer dan 300 miljoen moleculair gewicht .
Als we het op een 10 lettertype <unk> met geen <unk> , <unk> we <unk> pagina \&apos; s om deze genetische code te printen .
Hoe zetten we een chromosoom op ? Hoe activeren we dit ?
Uiteraard , met een virus , is het vrij eenvoudig .
Het is veel ingewikkelder met bacteriën .
Het is ook eenvoudiger dan wij in <unk> als wij : je kunt de kern <unk> en in een ander <unk> , en daar hebben jullie allemaal gehoord over <unk> .
Met bacteriën en <unk> wordt het chromosoom geïntegreerd in de cel , maar recentelijk toonden we dat we een compleet <unk> van een chromosoom van een cel naar een ander kunnen doen .
We <unk> een chromosoom uit een microbiële soort .
Deze twee zijn zo ver als mens en muizen .
We voegden een paar extra genen toe om voor dit chromosoom te selecteren .
We <unk> het met <unk> om alle eiwitten te doden .
Het was <unk> als we dit in de cel plaatsten -- en je <unk> onze zeer geavanceerde grafische beelden in de cel .
We dachten dat dit misschien zo ver mogelijk was , maar we probeerden het proces wat verder ging .
Dit is een belangrijk mechanisme van evolutie hier .
We vinden allerlei soorten soorten die een tweede chromosoom hebben , of een derde van een derde , <unk> <unk> in een seconde .
Mensen die denken aan evolutie als slechts één gen die een tijd heeft die veel biologie <unk> .
Er zijn <unk> genaamd <unk> die DNA <unk> .
Het chromosoom dat in de cel was , heeft niet één hebben .
Het chromosoom dat we <unk> .
Ze werd <unk> en <unk> het ander chromosoom als buitenlandse materiaal , <unk> , en daarom <unk> we met een cel met het nieuwe chromosoom .
Het was blauw , door de genen die we erin <unk> .
En met een zeer korte tijd , werden alle kenmerken van één soort <unk> verloren en de nieuwe soorten <unk> op basis van de nieuwe software die we in de cel plaatsten .
Alle eiwitten veranderden , de <unk> veranderden ; als we de genetische code lezen , was het precies wat we hadden <unk> .
Dit klinkt misschien als <unk> <unk> , maar we kunnen , door de software van DNA om heen en weer te bewegen .
Ik ben <unk> , dit is niet <unk> ; dit is op drie en een halve miljard jaar evolutie , en ik <unk> dat we misschien een nieuwe versie hebben van de <unk> explosie , waar er enorme nieuwe <unk> op basis van dit digitale ontwerp .
Waarom ?
Ik denk dat dit vrij duidelijk is in termen van de behoeften .
We gaan van zes tot negen miljard mensen in de komende 40 jaar .
Om het in de context te brengen : ik ben geboren in 1946 .
Er zijn nu drie mensen op de planeet .
Voor ieder van ons die in 1946 , binnen 40 jaar , zullen er vier zijn .
We hebben problemen met <unk> , vers , water , <unk> , brandstof voor de zes en een half miljard .
Het zal een <unk> zijn voor negen .
We gebruiken meer dan 5 miljard ton steenkool , 30 <unk> olie .
Dat is honderd miljoen vaten per dag .
Als we aan biologische processen gaan nadenken , of een proces , dan zal het een enorme uitdaging zijn .
Dan is er natuurlijk allemaal die CO2 uit dit materiaal in de atmosfeer .
We hebben nu , van onze ontdekking , een database met 20 miljoen genen , en ik hou ervan om dit als de <unk> van de toekomst te zien .
De <unk> had slechts een dozijn of zo onderdelen , en kijk naar de diversiteit die daaruit kwam .
We zijn beperkt door een biologische realiteit en onze verbeelding .
We hebben nu technieken , wegen van deze snelle methoden van synthese , om <unk> <unk> te doen .
We kunnen nu een grote robot bouwen die een miljoen chromosomen per dag kan maken .
Als je bedenkt dat deze 20 miljoen verschillende genen verwerken of pogingen om <unk> te bouwen , dan kunnen we alleen maar met een klein team produceren , dan kunnen we met een klein team , meer moleculaire biologie doen dan de afgelopen 20 jaar van alle wetenschap .
Het is een <unk> selectie .
We kunnen kiezen voor <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , enz .
Dit is een beeld van een echte <unk> van een echte <unk> waar we in staat zijn om te kunnen zitten en in de computer te <unk> .
Weet je , we weten niet noodzakelijk hoe het eruit ziet .
We weten precies hoe hun genetische code eruit ziet .
We richten ons nu op een <unk> brandstoffen .
Je hebt recentelijk gezien : maïs ethanol is slechts een slecht experiment .
We hebben <unk> en <unk> brandstof die relatief binnenkort zullen komen dat suiker zijn , tot veel <unk> brandstoffen , zoals <unk> of verschillende soorten <unk> .
Maar de enige manier waarop we denken dat biologie een grote impact heeft zonder de kosten van voedsel en beperken zijn de beschikbaarheid van CO2 als <unk> , en dus werken we met de eerste <unk> brandstof in zo \&apos; n 18 maanden .
<unk> en CO2 is een methode , maar in onze ontdekking hebben we allerlei manieren .
Dit is een organisme die we beschreven in 1996 .
Het leeft in de diepe oceaan , ongeveer anderhalve kilometer , bijna bij <unk> temperaturen .
Het kost CO2 voor methaan met moleculaire waterstof als energiebron .
We kijken naar <unk> CO2 , die makkelijk <unk> op sites , die CO2 terug in brandstof omzetten in brandstof om dit proces te besturen .
Dus , in een korte tijd , in een korte tijd , denken we dat we kunnen toenemen wat de fundamentele vraag is : &quot; Wat is het leven ? &quot;
We hebben een <unk> doel om de hele <unk> industrie te vervangen .
Ja , als je dat niet bij TED kunt doen , waar kan je ?
Een belangrijke bron van energie ...
Maar ook , we werken nu aan deze tools om <unk> <unk> te komen .
Je ziet dit jaar met griep ; we zijn altijd een jaar achter en een dollar kort als het juiste vaccin gaat .
Ik denk dat die kunnen veranderen door <unk> vaccins in <unk> .
Dit is hoe de toekomst begint met het veranderen , nu de evolutionaire boom , de evolutie versnelt met synthetische bacteriën , <unk> en , uiteindelijk , <unk> .
We zijn een weg <unk> .
We moeten ervoor zorgen dat we een kans hebben om lang genoeg te overleven . Hartelijk dank .
Wat ik jullie ga laten zien , hoe snel ik kan laten zien , is een <unk> werk , een nieuwe technologie die we naar Microsoft brachten als onderdeel van een jaar geleden .
Dit is <unk> , en het is een omgeving waarin je ofwel lokaal kunt interageren , met een vast aantal visuele data .
We kijken naar vele , vele <unk> van digitale foto \&apos; s , en naadloos inzoomen , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Het maakt niet uit hoeveel informatie we kijken , hoe belangrijk deze <unk> zijn of hoe grote de beelden zijn .
De meesten zijn gewone digitale <unk> , maar deze , bijvoorbeeld , een scan van de Library of Congress , en het is in de 300 <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Het maakt geen verschil , want het enige wat de voorstelling van een dergelijk systeem moet beperken , is het aantal pixels op je scherm op elk moment .
Het is ook zeer flexibel architectuur .
Dit is een heel boek , dit is een voorbeeld van <unk> data .
Dit is &quot; <unk> House &quot; van Dickens , elke column is een hoofdstuk .
Om jullie te bewijzen dat het echt tekst is , en niet een afbeelding , we kunnen iets doen , om echt te laten zien dat dit een echte voorstelling is van de tekst ; het is geen plaatje .
Misschien is dit een kunstmatige manier om een <unk> te lezen .
Ik zou het niet <unk> .
Dit is een <unk> zaak , een kwestie van de Guardian .
Elk groot plaatje is het begin van een <unk> .
Dit geeft je het plezier en de goede ervaring om de echte versie van een tijdschrift of een krant te lezen , een inherent <unk> soort medium .
We hebben iets met de hoek van dit onderwerp gedaan .
We hebben een <unk> <unk> die zeer hoge resolutie is - veel hoger dan in een gewone advertentie - en we hebben extra inhoud <unk> .
Als je de kenmerken van deze auto wilt zien , zie je het hier .
Of andere modellen , of zelfs technische <unk> .
Dit gaat echt over een aantal van deze ideeën over het scherm op het scherm .
We hopen dat dit niet meer <unk> en ander <unk> <unk> .
Natuurlijk , in kaart , in kaart brengen , is het een van die <unk> toepassingen voor een technologie zoals dit , en deze die ik geen tijd heb , behalve te zeggen dat we het ook hebben moeten bijdragen aan dit veld .
Maar het zijn alle wegen in de VS .
<unk> boven een NASA <unk> beeld .
Laten we nu even <unk> .
Dit is nu op het web , je kunt het <unk> .
Dit is een project genaamd <unk> , die twee verschillende technologieën <unk> .
Een daarvan is <unk> en het andere is een heel mooi <unk> onderzoek van <unk> <unk> , een graduate student aan de universiteit van Washington , <unk> door Steve <unk> bij <unk> .
Rick <unk> bij Microsoft Research . Een heel leuke samenwerking .
Dit is live op het web , het wordt aangedreven door <unk> .
Je kunt zien dat wanneer we deze soorten <unk> , waar we door beelden kunnen duiken en dit soort <unk> ervaring hebben .
Maar de ruimtelijke <unk> van deze beelden is eigenlijk betekenisvol .
De <unk> hebben deze beelden <unk> , zodat ze overeenkomen met de echte ruimte waarin deze opnames -- allemaal <unk> <unk> <unk> in de <unk> <unk> -- allemaal <unk> . Hier zie je elementen van <unk> <unk> of <unk> , en deze dingen hebben allemaal <unk> <unk> .
Ik ben er niet zeker van of ik tijd heb om een andere omgeving te tonen .
Sommige zijn veel meer <unk> .
Ik zou willen springen naar een van <unk> <unk> -- dit komt uit een vroeg prototype dat we deze zomer hebben gewerkt -- om je te laten zien wat ik denk , de <unk> achter de <unk> technologie , het is niet noodzakelijk <unk> van de omgevingen die we op de website staan .
We moesten ons zorgen maken over de advocaten enzovoort .
Dit is een <unk> van <unk> Dame die volledig <unk> gemaakt was van beelden <unk> van Flickr , je typt gewoon <unk> Dame in Flickr , en je krijgt foto \&apos; s van jongens in T-shirts , en de campus enzovoort .
Elk van deze oranje <unk> staat een beeld die ontdekte dat hij naar dit model moest komen .
Dit zijn allemaal <unk> en allemaal <unk> <unk> op deze manier .
We kunnen alleen op een simpele manier navigeren .
Ik had nooit gedacht dat ik bij Microsoft werkte .
Het is zeer <unk> om dit soort <unk> hier te hebben .
Ik denk dat dit veel verschillende soorten camera \&apos; s zijn : het is alles van <unk> camera \&apos; s , een groot aantal <unk> , <unk> in deze omgeving .
Als ik een aantal vreemde dingen kan vinden ...
Velen zijn <unk> door gezichten , enzovoort .
Hier zie je een serie foto \&apos; s van foto \&apos; s -- hier gaan we .
Dit is een poster van <unk> Dame die goed geregistreerd is .
We kunnen in de poster duiken met een fysiek beeld van deze omgeving .
Wat het punt is , is dat we dingen kunnen doen met de sociale omgeving . Dit is nu data van iedereen - vanuit het gehele collectieve geheugen , visueel , wat de Aarde eruit ziet -- en alle <unk> .
Die foto \&apos; s worden verbonden , en ze maken iets <unk> die groter is dan de som van de delen .
Je hebt een model die voortkomt uit de hele Aarde .
Denk aan dit als de lange staart naar Stephen <unk> <unk> .
Dit groeit in complexiteit als mensen het gebruiken , en waarvan hun voordelen groter worden bij de gebruikers .
Hun eigen foto \&apos; s worden <unk> met <unk> die iemand anders deed .
Als iemand die <unk> <unk> en zeggen wie ze allemaal zijn , dan kreeg mijn foto van <unk> <unk> <unk> met al die data , en ik kan het als <unk> gebruiken in die ruimte , met de foto \&apos; s van de foto \&apos; s , en een soort <unk> en <unk> sociale ervaring .
Natuurlijk , een <unk> daarvan is enorm rijke virtuele modellen van elk interessant deel van de Aarde , niet alleen door <unk> en van <unk> , maar vanuit het collectieve geheugen .
Dank je wel .
Chris Anderson : Ik begrijp het goed ? Wat je software laat toestaan , is dat , op een bepaald moment , echt in de komende paar jaar , alle foto \&apos; s die gedeeld worden door iedereen over de hele wereld ?
<unk> : Ja .
Ik heb het <unk> , als je wilt , tussen beelden .
Dat doet het op basis van de inhoud in de beelden .
Dat wordt pas spannend als je denkt aan de rijkdom van de <unk> informatie veel beelden .
Zoals wanneer je een <unk> zoekt naar beelden , en de tekst op de <unk> zit een hoop informatie bij de <unk> .
Wat deze foto is .
Wat als die foto \&apos; s links naar alle foto \&apos; s ? De hoeveelheid <unk> <unk> en rijkdom die eruit komen , is een typisch <unk> .
CA : <unk> ongelooflijk . <unk> .
Een van de intense <unk> van reizen en een van de <unk> van <unk> onderzoek is de kans tussen diegenen die niet de oude manier hebben verloren , die nog steeds hun verleden in de wind <unk> , het in stenen <unk> <unk> , het in de <unk> <unk> .
Ik weet alleen nog niet dat <unk> <unk> nog verder gaat dan de Melkweg , of de <unk> van de Inuit nog steeds , of dat in de Himalaya , de <unk> nog steeds de <unk> <unk> , zich herinnert aan de centrale <unk> , en dat is het idee dat de wereld waarin we leven niet bestaan , maar slechts één model van de werkelijkheid .
Het gevolg van een bepaalde set van <unk> keuzes die onze <unk> gemaakt hebben , net als <unk> , vele generaties geleden .
We delen allemaal dezelfde <unk> <unk> . We worden allemaal geboren . We brengen allemaal onze kinderen in de wereld .
We gaan door <unk> <unk> .
We moeten de <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Het moet ons niet verbazen dat we allemaal zingen , we allemaal allemaal kunst .
Wat interessant is , is de unieke <unk> van het liedje , het ritme van de dans in elke cultuur .
Of het <unk> in de bossen van <unk> , of de <unk> <unk> in Haïti , of de <unk> in het midden van de Andes , het <unk> in de bergen van de Andes , of een <unk> in het midden van de Sahara -- dit is <unk> de man die ik in de woestijn reisde met een maand geleden , of zelfs een <unk> in de <unk> van <unk> .
Everest , de <unk> moeder van de wereld .
Al deze mensen leren ons dat er andere manieren zijn om te zijn , andere manieren van denken , andere manieren om in de aarde te <unk> .
Dit is een idee , als je erover nadenkt , kan je alleen met hoop invullen .
Nu , samen met de <unk> culturen van de wereld , maken we een web van spirituele levens en culturele leven die de planeet <unk> , en zo belangrijk is voor het welzijn van de planeet , zoals in werkelijkheid het biologische web van het leven .
Je zou kunnen denken aan dit culturele web van het leven als <unk> .
Je zou misschien de <unk> kunnen definiëren als de sum van alle gedachten en dromen , <unk> , ideeën , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Het <unk> is de grote nalatenschap van de mensheid .
Het is het symbool van alles wat we zijn en allemaal dat we als verbijsterend <unk> soorten kunnen zijn .
Zoals de biosfeer ernstig <unk> , is het ook de <unk> -- en , als iets , met een veel grotere snelheid .
Geen biologen , bijvoorbeeld , zouden durven suggereren dat 50 procent van alle soorten of op de rand van <unk> , omdat het niet waar is .
En toch , het meest <unk> scenario die we kennen , <unk> de meest optimistische scenario \&apos; s in het rijk van culturele diversiteit .
De grote <unk> hiervan is natuurlijk <unk> .
Als ieder van jullie in deze zaal geboren werd , waren er 6.000 talen gesproken op de planeet .
Een taal is niet alleen een lichaam van een <unk> of een set van <unk> regels .
Een taal is een <unk> van de menselijke geest .
Het is een voertuig die de ziel van elke bepaalde cultuur <unk> in de materiële wereld .
Elke taal is een oud bos van de geest , een <unk> , een idee , een <unk> , een <unk> , een <unk> .
En van de 6000 talen , zoals we hier vandaag in Monterey zitten , is er volledig de helft niet langer in de oren van kinderen .
Ze worden niet langer onderwezen tot baby \&apos; s .
Dat betekent dat , als iets verandert , ze al dood zijn .
Wat zou meer dan eenzaam kunnen zijn in stilte , om de laatste van je mensen te spreken , om je taal te spreken , om de wijsheid van de voorouders te krijgen , of de belofte van de kinderen van de kinderen ?
En toch , dat <unk> lot is inderdaad de <unk> van iemand in de Aarde , ongeveer elke twee weken , want elke twee weken , een oudere man sterft en draagt bij hem de laatste <unk> van een oude <unk> .
Ik weet dat sommigen van jullie zeggen : &quot; Zou het niet beter zijn , zou de wereld niet een betere plek zijn als we allemaal een taal hebben ? &quot; Ik zeg : &quot; Geweldig , laten we die <unk> maken . Laten we het <unk> maken . &quot;
Laten we het <unk> . \&apos; En je zult plotseling ontdekken hoe het zou zijn om je eigen taal te spreken .
Wat ik vandaag met jullie wil doen , is een reis van het <unk> , een korte reis door de <unk> , om je een idee te geven van wat in werkelijkheid verloren wordt .
Er zijn veel van ons die vergeten dat als ik &quot; verschillende manieren &quot; zeg , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel , ik bedoel ook verschillende manieren om te zijn .
Neem bijvoorbeeld dit kind van een <unk> in het <unk> , de mensen van de <unk> die geloven dat ze de <unk> van het oosten in de buik van heilige slangen <unk> .
Dit is een mensen die niet de kleur van de kleur onderscheiden van de kleur groen , omdat het bladerdak van de hemel <unk> naar het bladerdak van het bos , waar de mensen afhankelijk zijn .
Ze hebben een <unk> taal en <unk> die \&apos; <unk> <unk> \&apos; noemen : je moet trouwen met iemand die een andere taal spreekt .
Dit is allemaal geworteld in het <unk> verleden , maar het <unk> in deze lange huizen , waar er zes of zeven talen gesproken worden door <unk> , je hoort nooit iemand een taal die een taal <unk> .
Ze luisteren gewoon en beginnen te spreken .
Een van de meest fascinerende stammen die ik ooit had gewoond , de <unk> van <unk> Ecuador , een <unk> <unk> in 1958 .
In 1957 probeerden vijf <unk> en maakten een <unk> fout .
Ze lieten vallen van de lucht 8 <unk> foto \&apos; s van zichzelf in wat we zouden zeggen om vriendelijke gebaren te zijn en te vergeten dat deze mensen van het regenwoud nooit in hun leven hadden gezien .
Ze namen foto \&apos; s van de <unk> , probeerden erachter te kijken naar het gezicht of de figuur .
Ze vonden niets , en <unk> dat dit de <unk> van de duivel <unk> , zodat ze de vijf <unk> <unk> .
Maar het <unk> niet alleen <unk> <unk> . Ze <unk> elkaar .
54 procent van hun <unk> was <unk> .
We <unk> acht generaties lang , en we vonden twee gevallen van natuurlijke doden .
Toen we de mensen erover <unk> , gaven ze een <unk> die zo oud was dat hij zo oud was dat hij oud werd , dus we <unk> hem toch , maar tegelijkertijd hadden ze een <unk> kennis van het bos dat verbazingwekkend was .
Hun jagers konden <unk> in 40 <unk> ruiken en vertellen wat de <unk> <unk> .
In de vroege jaren 80 had ik een verbazingwekkende opdracht toen ik mijn professor bij Harvard had gevraagd of ik geïnteresseerd was in Haïti , <unk> de geheime <unk> die het <unk> van <unk> en <unk> <unk> en het gif gebruikte om <unk> te maken .
Om de <unk> te begrijpen , moest ik iets begrijpen over dit opmerkelijke geloof van <unk> , en <unk> geen zwarte <unk> .
Integendeel , het is een complex <unk> wereldbeeld . Het is interessant .
Als ik je vroeg om de grote religies van de wereld te benoemen , wat zou je dan zeggen ?
Het <unk> , islam , <unk> , wat ook .
Er is altijd één continent <unk> , de veronderstelling dat <unk> Afrika geen religieuze overtuigingen had .
<unk> zijn simpelweg de <unk> van deze zeer diepgaande religieuze ideeën die tijdens de tragische diaspora van het slavernij kwamen .
Wat <unk> interessant maakt is dat het een levende relatie is tussen het leven en de doden .
Dus , de levende aanwezigheid van de geesten .
De geesten kunnen <unk> worden van onder het Grote water , reageren op het ritme van de dans tot <unk> de ziel van het leven , zodat de <unk> de god <unk> .
Daarom zeggen de <unk> : &quot; Jullie blanke mensen gaan naar de kerk en spreken over God .
We dansen in de tempel en worden God . &quot; En omdat je <unk> bent , word je <unk> , hoe kan je <unk> worden ?
Deze verbazingwekkende <unk> : <unk> <unk> in een <unk> <unk> in een <unk> .
Een <unk> demonstratie van het vermogen om het lichaam te beïnvloeden die het <unk> in de staat extreme <unk> <unk> .
Van alle volkeren die ik ooit heb meegemaakt , zijn het meest uitzonderlijke van de Sierra Nevada , het <unk> in noordelijk Colombia .
<unk> van de oude <unk> die ooit de <unk> <unk> <unk> , in de <unk> van de <unk> .
Deze mensen <unk> in een geïsoleerde vulkanische <unk> die boven het <unk> <unk> .
In een <unk> continent werden deze mensen alleen nooit <unk> door het Spaans .
Op deze dag blijven ze <unk> door een ritueel <unk> , maar de training voor het <unk> is nogal bijzonder .
De jonge <unk> worden <unk> van hun familie in het tijdperk van drie en vier .
<unk> in een <unk> wereld van de duisternis in steen <unk> in de onderkant van de gletsjers .
Twee <unk> <unk> <unk> om de negen maanden durende <unk> aan te sporen in hun natuurlijke moeders .
Ze zijn <unk> in het <unk> van de grote moeder .
En voor deze hele tijd <unk> ze in de waarden van hun maatschappij , waarden die het <unk> behouden dat hun gebeden en gebeden alleen kunnen behouden -- of we zouden kunnen zeggen de ecologische <unk> .
Aan het einde van deze fantastische <unk> , op een dag , worden ze ineens <unk> en voor de eerste keer in hun leven gezien , en in dat <unk> moment van het bewustzijn van het eerste licht , als de zon begint met het <unk> van het <unk> mooie landschap , ineens alles wat ze hebben geleerd in het abstracte <unk> , en de <unk> <unk> in <unk> , en de <unk> stappen terug .
En zegt : &quot; Zie je ? Ik heb je verteld .
Het is mooi . Het is je om te beschermen . \&apos; Ze noemen zichzelf \&apos; <unk> <unk> \&apos; .
Ze zeggen dat we , wie de jongere , degenen die verantwoordelijk zijn voor het vernietigen van de wereld .
Dit niveau van intuïtie wordt zeer belangrijk .
Als we denken aan inheemse mensen en landschap , dan <unk> we ofwel <unk> <unk> en de oude <unk> \&apos; s , een idee in zijn eenvoud .
Of <unk> , we <unk> <unk> en zeggen dat deze mensen dichterbij de Aarde zijn dan wij .
Nou , inheemse mensen zijn geen <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
Er is niet veel zaal voor in het <unk> <unk> van de <unk> of in de <unk> van Tibet , maar ze hebben , in <unk> , een traditionele <unk> van de Aarde , die niet aan het idee van het idee <unk> , maar een ver <unk> intuïtie : het idee dat de Aarde zelf alleen bestaat doordat de Aarde alleen bestaat doordat het menselijk bewustzijn .
Wat data ? Het betekent dat een jonge jongen uit de Andes die een <unk> geest <unk> die het of haar lot een heel ander mens zal zijn en een andere relatie met die bron van Montana , of die plek dan een jong jongen uit Montana <unk> om te geloven dat een berg <unk> <unk> .
Of het <unk> van een geest of een stapel <unk> is irrelevant .
Wat interessant is , is de metafoor die de relatie <unk> tussen het individu en de natuur .
Ik werd opgevoed in de bossen van British Columbia om te geloven dat die bossen <unk> werden .
Dat maakte me een ander mens dan mijn vrienden onder de <unk> die geloven dat die bossen de <unk> waren van <unk> en de <unk> <unk> van <unk> en de <unk> geesten die <unk> aan het noorden van de wereld .
geesten die ze moesten doen tijdens hun <unk> <unk> .
Als je kijkt naar het idee dat deze culturen verschillende <unk> kunnen creëren , dan zou je een aantal van hun buitengewone ontdekkingen kunnen begrijpen . Neem deze plant hier .
Het is een foto die ik in de <unk> Amazone nam .
Dit is <unk> , waarover velen van jullie gehoord hebben , de krachtigste <unk> van het <unk> .
Wat fascinerend maakt , is niet de <unk> <unk> mogelijkheden van deze voorbereiding , maar het <unk> .
Aan de ene kant , een <unk> <unk> die een serie <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ...
Om de <unk> alleen maar met blauwe <unk> in te voeren ...
Maar het is gemengd met de bladeren van een <unk> in het <unk> <unk> .
Deze plant had een zeer krachtige <unk> , zeer dicht bij de <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Als je ooit de <unk> hebt gezien die hun neus <unk> , dan maakt de materie die ze uit een verschillende set van soorten <unk> .
Om dat poeder onder ogen te krijgen , lijkt het alsof je in een <unk> <unk> met <unk> foto \&apos; s en landing op een zee van elektriciteit . Het creëert de <unk> van de werkelijkheid .
Ik begon met mijn professor , Richard Evan <unk> -- een man die een man die het <unk> tijdperk <unk> met zijn ontdekking , in de jaren 30 in Mexico .
Ik stel me voor dat je deze <unk> niet <unk> als <unk> , want tegen de tijd dat je onder de effecten staat , is er geen huis meer om een <unk> te ervaren , maar het punt met <unk> is dat ze niet <unk> worden omdat ze <unk> door een <unk> in de menselijke <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Ze kunnen alleen <unk> worden als in <unk> met een paar chemische stoffen die de <unk> <unk> .
De fascinerende dingen zijn dat de <unk> in die <unk> <unk> <unk> van het precieze niveau van de <unk> . Dus je stelt jezelf een vraag stellen : hoe , in een <unk> van 80.000 soorten <unk> , deze mensen vinden deze twee <unk> <unk> <unk> , die in deze manier een soort <unk> versie van het algemeen zijn dan de som van de delen ?
Nou , we gebruiken die grote <unk> , &quot; <unk> en opstaan &quot; , wat <unk> is .
Maar je vraagt de Indiërs en zegt : &quot; De planten spreken met ons . &quot; Wat betekent data Deze stam , het <unk> , heeft 17 soorten <unk> , waarvan ze een grote afstand hebben in het bos , allemaal <unk> naar ons oog als één soort .
Dan vraag je hen hoe ze hun <unk> <unk> en zeggen : &quot; Ik dacht dat je iets wist over planten .
Ik bedoel , weet je , weet je iets ? &quot; Ik zei : &quot; Nee . &quot;
Nou , het blijkt elk van de 17 soorten in de nacht van een volle maan , en het <unk> naar een andere sleutel .
Dat zal je geen <unk> in Harvard krijgen , maar het is veel interessanter dan <unk> .
Het probleem - het probleem - het probleem is dat zelfs die van ons <unk> met de <unk> van inheemse mensen als <unk> en <unk> op de grenzen van de geschiedenis als de echte wereld , ons wereld <unk> .
De waarheid is de 20e eeuw , 300 jaar lang , zal niet herinnerd worden aan de oorlog of zijn technologische innovaties , maar in plaats van het tijdperk waarin we stonden en actief <unk> of passief <unk> of passief diversiteit op de planeet . Nu , het probleem is niet veranderen .
Alle culturen over de hele tijd hebben zich <unk> in een dans met nieuwe mogelijkheden van het leven .
Het probleem is niet technologie zelf .
De Sioux die niet <unk> werden , waren niet <unk> toen ze de boog gaven en een <unk> meer dan een Amerikaan had als hij het paard <unk> en <unk> .
Het is niet veranderen of technologie die de integriteit van de <unk> <unk> . Het is macht .
Het ruwe gezicht van <unk> .
Als je kijkt naar de wereld , ontdek je dat dit niet <unk> culturen <unk> .
Dit zijn dynamische levende wezens die zich <unk> door <unk> krachten die zich buiten hun capaciteit richten .
Of de <unk> in de <unk> van de <unk> -- een volk die <unk> in het bos had , en nu werden alle <unk> <unk> en prostitutie op de <unk> van de rivier , waar je de rivier zelf ziet <unk> met de helft van <unk> naar de <unk> , waar de Japanse <unk> licht <unk> aan de horizon , waar de Japanse <unk> licht <unk> aan de horizon .
Klaar om met een <unk> <unk> te <unk> in het bos .
In het geval van de <unk> , het is de <unk> die binnenkomen , in de <unk> van goud .
Of in de bergen van Tibet , waar ik recentelijk veel onderzoek mee bezig ben , dan zie je het een <unk> gezicht van politieke <unk> .
Weet je , genocide , het fysieke van een volk is algemeen <unk> , maar <unk> , de vernietiging van mensen van het leven , is niet alleen niet <unk> , het is universeel , in vele hoeken , <unk> als onderdeel van een <unk> .
Je kunt de pijn van Tibet niet begrijpen , tot je in het hart staat .
Ik heb een <unk> km afgelegd van <unk> in West China , door <unk> in Tibet .
Toen ik een jonge collega was , was het pas bij een jonge collega \&apos; s waar ik het gezicht van je hoorde .
6000 heilige <unk> <unk> in <unk> en <unk> , 1,2 miljoen mensen door de <unk> tijdens de <unk> Revolutie .
De vader van deze jongeman was <unk> aan de <unk> Lama .
Dat betekende dat hij meteen gedood was bij de tijd van de Chinese invasie .
Zijn oom <unk> met zijn <unk> in de diaspora die de mensen naar Nepal brachten .
Zijn moeder zat gevangen voor het <unk> van <unk> .
Hij werd in de gevangenis <unk> in de gevangenis , terwijl ze <unk> onder de <unk> <unk> omdat ze niet mochten zonder hem .
De zus die de moed had gedaan , was een <unk> in een <unk> .
Op een dag <unk> ze op een <unk> van Mao , en voor die <unk> werd ze zeven jaar zware arbeid gegeven .
De pijn van Tibet kan onmogelijk zijn , maar de <unk> geest van de mensen is iets om te zien .
Uiteindelijk gaat het om een keuze .
Willen we in een <unk> wereld leven in een <unk> wereld of willen we een <unk> wereld <unk> ?
Margaret <unk> , de grote <unk> , zei , voordat ze stierf , dat haar grootste angst was dat we naar deze <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Niet alleen zouden we het hele scala aan de menselijke verbeelding zien <unk> tot een meer <unk> <unk> , maar dat we zouden kunnen worden <unk> van een droom die een droom had verloren .
Het is <unk> om ons te herinneren dat onze soort , misschien al , 150.000 jaar lang gebruikt .
De <unk> Revolutie , die ons landbouw gaf , waarmee we <unk> naar de <unk> van het zaad , de poëzie van de <unk> werd <unk> door de <unk> van de <unk> ; we creëerden hiërarchie <unk> -- is slechts 10.000 jaar geleden .
De moderne industriële wereld zoals wij weten dat het bijna 300 jaar oud is .
Die <unk> geschiedenis suggereert niet dat we alle antwoorden op alle uitdagingen die ons zullen <unk> in de komende millennia .
Wanneer deze <unk> culturen van de wereld worden gevraagd worden de betekenis van mens , ze reageren met 10.000 verschillende stemmen .
In dat lied zullen we allemaal de mogelijkheid ontdekken om te zijn : een volledig bewuste soort , volledig bewust van <unk> dat alle volkeren en alle tuinen een manier vinden om te <unk> . En er zijn grote momenten van optimisme .
Dit is een foto die ik op het noordelijk halfrond nam , toen ik <unk> met een paar Inuit <unk> .
Deze man , <unk> , vertelde me een prachtig verhaal van zijn opa .
De <unk> overheid was niet altijd de <unk> geweest , en in de jaren 50 , om onze <unk> <unk> te <unk> , <unk> we ze in <unk> .
De opa van deze oude man weigerde te gaan .
Het gezin , bang voor zijn leven , nam al zijn wapens , al zijn gereedschap .
Je moet begrijpen dat de Inuit niet bang zijn , ze <unk> ermee .
De <unk> van hun <unk> werden oorspronkelijk gemaakt in <unk> <unk> .
De opa van deze man was niet <unk> door de <unk> of de <unk> die <unk> .
Hij <unk> naar buiten , trok zijn <unk> <unk> en <unk> in zijn hand , en toen de <unk> <unk> , vormde hij het in de vorm van een <unk> .
Hij zette een <unk> aan de rand van het <unk> .
Terwijl het eindelijk <unk> , <unk> hij een hond ermee .
Hij <unk> de hond en <unk> een <unk> .
Ik nam de <unk> van de hond en <unk> een <unk> .
<unk> een <unk> hond , en verdween over het ijs , <unk> in <unk> .
Om te beginnen met niets te krijgen . Dit is een symbool van de <unk> van de <unk> van de <unk> en alle inheemse volkeren over de hele wereld .
De <unk> overheid in april 1999 gaf weer een totale controle over de Inuit een gebied van land in Californië en Texas , het is onze nieuwe <unk> . Het heet <unk> .
Het is een onafhankelijk <unk> . Ze controleren alle mineralen .
Een geweldig voorbeeld van hoe een <unk> kan <unk> met zijn volk .
Uiteindelijk denk ik dat het vrij duidelijk is voor iedereen die in deze afgelegen <unk> van de planeet <unk> , om te beseffen dat ze helemaal niet afgelegen zijn .
Ze zijn <unk> van iemand .
Ze vertegenwoordigen <unk> van de menselijke verbeelding die terug naar de <unk> gaan , en voor ons allemaal , de dromen van onze eigen kinderen , deel uitmaken van de naakte geografie van hoop .
Wat we nu proberen te doen bij National Geographic , is , we geloven dat politici nooit zullen bereiken .
We denken dat <unk> -- we denken dat <unk> niet overtuigend zijn , maar we denken dat de verhalen de wereld veranderen , en daarom zijn we de beste <unk> <unk> in de wereld . We krijgen elke maand 35 miljoen hits op onze website . Onze tijdschriften worden miljoenen .
Wat we doen , is een reeks reizen naar de <unk> waar we ons publiek <unk> aan plekken van zo \&apos; n cultureel wonder dat ze niet kunnen helpen , en hopelijk , daarom , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> wereld , dat deze wereld op een diverse manier moet bestaan , dat we een manier vinden om in een werkelijk <unk> wereld te leven , dat we een manier vinden om in een echt <unk> , <unk> wereld te leven .
Waar alle wijsheid van alle volkeren kunnen bijdragen aan ons collectieve welzijn .
Heel erg bedankt .
Ik ga het hebben over enkele dingen die in dit boek zitten .
Ik hoop dat ik hoop heb aan andere dingen die je al gehoord hebt .
Ik zal een paar verbindingen maken , waarbij je ze <unk> .
Ik wil beginnen met wat ik de officiële dogma \&apos; <unk> noem .
De officiële dogma \&apos; s van alle westerse industriële samenlevingen ?
En de officiële dogma \&apos; s loopt zo : als we geïnteresseerd zijn in het welzijn van onze burgers , hoe dan ook , is het om de individuele vrijheid te <unk> .
De reden hiervoor is dat vrijheid in zichzelf en zichzelf goed , waardevol , essentieel is voor mens .
En want als mensen vrijheid hebben , dan kunnen ieder van ons zich inzetten om de dingen die ons welzijn <unk> en niemand moet beslissen .
De manier om vrijheid te optimaliseren , is om de keuze te <unk> .
Hoe meer keuze mensen hebben , hoe meer vrijheid ze hebben .
Hoe meer vrijheid ze hebben , hoe meer <unk> ze hebben .
Ik denk dat , denk ik , zo diep in de <unk> zit die het niet zou voordoen .
Het zit ook diep in ons leven .
Ik zal wat voorbeelden geven van wat moderne vooruitgang voor ons mogelijk was .
Dit is mijn supermarkt .
Niet zo \&apos; n grote . Ik wil een woord noemen over <unk> .
Ik heb een <unk> in mijn supermarkt , als je de 10 <unk> <unk> en 12 <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Om een heel groot aantal van je eigen <unk> te maken , in de <unk> die geen van de \&apos; 175 of de winkel \&apos; in staat zijn .
Dit is de supermarkt .
Dan ga je naar de supermarkt en <unk> een <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
In deze gewone winkel zijn er zoveel <unk> .
We kunnen <unk> verschillende <unk> bouwen uit de onderdelen die op een winkel staan .
Je moet toegeven dat het veel keuze is .
In andere domeinen -- de wereld van communicatie .
Toen ik een jongen was , toen ik een jongen was , toen je een <unk> zou kunnen krijgen , dan was er zo lang in de <unk> .
Je <unk> je telefoon . Je kocht het niet .
Een gevolg hiervan is trouwens dat de telefoon nooit <unk> .
Die dagen zijn weg .
We hebben nu een bijna <unk> soort telefoons .
Vooral in de wereld van mobiele telefoons .
Dit zijn mobiele telefoons van de toekomst .
Mijn favoriet is de middelste -- de <unk> , <unk> <unk> en <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Als je dat nog niet hebt gezien in je winkel , dan kan je een <unk> <unk> .
Wat dit doet , leidt mensen om in hun winkels deze vraag te stellen .
Weet je wat het antwoord op deze vraag is ?
Het antwoord is &quot; nee &quot; .
Je kunt een mobiele telefoon kopen die niet teveel werkt .
In andere aspecten van het leven die veel belangrijker zijn dan het kopen van dingen , is dezelfde <unk> .
Gezondheid . Het is niet langer het geval in de Verenigde Staten , en de dokter vertelt je wat te doen .
In plaats daarvan ga je naar de dokter , en de dokter vertelt je : &quot; We kunnen A , of we kunnen kiezen .
Er zijn een voordeel en deze risico \&apos; s .
B heeft deze voordelen en deze risico . Wat wil je ? &quot;
Je zegt : &quot; Doc , wat moet ik doen ? &quot;
De <unk> zegt : &quot; Een heeft die voordelen en risico \&apos; s heeft , en B heeft deze voordelen en risico \&apos; s .
Wat wil je ? &quot;
Je zegt : &quot; Als je me was , dokter , wat zou je doen ? &quot;
De <unk> zegt : &quot; Maar ik ben niet jij . &quot;
Het resultaat is -- we noemen het \&apos; patiënt \&apos; .
Het klinkt als een goede zaak , maar het is een <unk> van de last en de verantwoordelijkheid voor beslissingen van iemand die iets weet -- namelijk de dokter , naar iemand die bijna ziek en <unk> is en niet in de beste vorm om beslissingen te nemen -- namelijk de patiënt . Er is enorme marketing of <unk> geneesmiddelen .
Mensen zoals jij en ik die , als je erover nadenkt , is helemaal niet , want we kunnen ze niet kopen .
Waarom passen ze naar ons toe ?
Het antwoord is dat ze onze artsen de volgende ochtend <unk> en ons <unk> moeten stellen .
Iets zo dramatisch als onze identiteit is een zaak van keuze , zoals deze dia bedoeld is .
We <unk> geen identiteit ; we kunnen het vinden .
We krijgen onszelf zo vaak als we willen .
Dat betekent dat elke dag , wanneer je \&apos; s morgens wakker wordt , je moet beslissen wat je wilt .
Met respect aan huwelijk en familie ...
Er was een tijd waarin de <unk> bijna iedereen had <unk> dat je zo snel getrouwd was als je kon .
De enige echte keuze was die niet , en niet wat je deed .
Tegenwoordig is alles veel <unk> .
Ik geef fantastische intelligente studenten , en ik geef 20 % minder werk dan vroeger .
Niet omdat ze minder slim zijn en niet omdat ze minder <unk> zijn .
Het komt omdat ze druk zijn en zich afvragen .
&quot; Moet ik trouwen of niet ? Moet ik trouwen ? Moet ik trouwen ?
Moet ik eerst kinderen krijgen , of carrière ? &quot;
Dit zijn allemaal vragen stellen .
Ze gaan deze vragen beantwoorden , of niet het werk doen dat ik <unk> en geen goede les heb in mijn cursussen .
Dat moeten ze ook . Dit zijn belangrijke vragen om te antwoorden .
Werk -- we zijn gezegend , zoals Carl <unk> <unk> , met de technologie die ons elke dag elke dag elke dag op de planeet kan werken -- behalve het Randolph .
Er is een hoek , trouwens , waar ik niemand zal vertellen , waar het <unk> werkt .
Ik vertel het niet , want ik wil het gebruiken .
Wat dit betekent , deze ongelooflijke vrije <unk> die we hebben met respect om te werken , is dat we een beslissing nemen , opnieuw en opnieuw , of we moeten niet werken .
We kunnen onze jongen spelen , en we hebben onze mobiele telefoon op één heup , en onze Blackberry over onze andere heup , en onze laptop , vermoedelijk , op onze <unk> .
Zelfs als ze allemaal <unk> , elke minuut dat we onze jongen <unk> , dan vragen we onszelf ook af : &quot; Moet ik deze mobiele telefoon beantwoorden ? &quot;
Moet ik op deze e-mail reageren ? Moet ik deze brief <unk> ? &quot;
Zelfs als het antwoord op de vraag is : &quot; Nee , &quot; het zal zeker de ervaring van je <unk> heel anders maken dan het zou zijn geweest .
Overal waar we kijken , grote dingen en kleine dingen , materiële dingen en levensstijl , is het leven een kwestie van keuze .
De wereld die we vroeger zagen in dit tijdperk .
In feite zijn ze in steen geschreven . Dat is te zeggen : er zijn wat keuzes , maar niet alles was een kwestie van keuze .
De wereld waarin we nu in dit leven wonen .
De vraag is : is dit goed nieuws , of slecht nieuws ?
Het antwoord is : &quot; Ja . &quot;
We weten allemaal wat er goed is , dus ik ga praten over wat daar slecht is .
Al deze keuze heeft twee effecten , twee negatieve effecten op mensen .
Een effect , <unk> , is dat het verlamming produceert in plaats van bevrijding .
Door zoveel opties te kiezen , vinden mensen het moeilijk om te kiezen .
Ik zal een zeer <unk> voorbeeld geven : een studie die investeringen deed in vrijwillige <unk> .
Een collega van mij kreeg toegang tot <unk> , het <unk> <unk> bedrijf van een miljoen werknemers en ongeveer 2000 verschillende <unk> .
Wat ze ontdekte is dat voor elke 10 wederzijdse <unk> de <unk> van participatie , twee procent gingen dalen .
Je betaalt 50 dollar -- 10 procent minder werknemers dan als je slechts vijf . Waarom ?
Want met 50 fondsen om te kiezen , is het zo moeilijker om te beslissen welke <unk> te kiezen , en morgen , morgen , morgen , en morgen , en morgen , en morgen , en morgen , en morgen ...
Natuurlijk komt morgen nooit .
Begrijp dat niet alleen dit betekent dat mensen voedsel moeten eten als ze met pensioen gaan , want ze hebben niet genoeg geld <unk> , het betekent ook dat ze zo moeilijk geld <unk> aan de <unk> van het <unk> .
Als je niet betrokken bent , geven ze zo weinig als 5.000 dollar per jaar .
van de <unk> , die gelukkig <unk> .
verlamming is een gevolg van veel keuzes . Ik denk dat het de wereld zo ziet .
En tenslotte , voor alle <unk> , Frans , <unk> , kaas ?
Je wilt echt de beslissing nemen als het voor alle <unk> zit , toch ?
Je wilt het verkeerde wederzijdse <unk> <unk> , of het verkeerde <unk> .
Dat is een effect . Het tweede effect is dat , zelfs als we de verlamming overwinnen en een keuze maken , we minder tevreden hebben met het resultaat van de keuze dan we zouden moeten kiezen als we minder keuzes moesten kiezen .
Er zijn verschillende redenen hiervoor .
Een ervan is dat met een hoop verschillende <unk> om te kiezen , als je er een kopen , en niet perfect -- en wat <unk> ?
Het is makkelijk om je een andere keuze te maken die beter zou kunnen zijn .
Wat er gebeurt , is dat je een alternatief alternatief <unk> om de beslissing die je deed .
Dit spijt je <unk> van de <unk> die je <unk> , zelfs als het een goede beslissing was .
Hoe meer opties er zijn , hoe makkelijker het is om alles te spijt die je gekozen hebt .
Ten tweede , wat economen \&apos; kansen kosten \&apos; noemen ?
Dan Gilbert <unk> een belangrijk punt om te praten over hoeveel de manier waarop we dingen waarderen over wat we met hen vergelijken .
Als er veel alternatieven zijn om te overwegen , is het makkelijk om de aantrekkelijke kenmerken van alternatieven die je <unk> <unk> .
Dat maakt je minder tevreden met het alternatief die je gekozen hebt .
Hier is een voorbeeld . Ik kan niet stoppen over die andere <unk> op een <unk> straat .
Dit is wat je moet denken .
Hier zie je dit koppel .
Heel duur <unk> .
<unk> strand . Mooi dag .
Wat kan beter zijn ? \&apos; Het is <unk> , \&apos; Deze man denkt ...
\&apos; Het is augustus . Iedereen in mijn <unk> wijk is weg .
Ik kon vlak voor mijn gebouw staan . &quot;
Hij geeft twee weken <unk> door het idee dat hij de kans mist , dag na dag , een grote parkeerplaats .
<unk> kosten <unk> van de <unk> die we kiezen , zelfs als we kiezen , zelfs als wat wij kiezen .
Hoe meer opties er zijn , de <unk> kenmerken van deze opties .
Ze zullen ons als <unk> <unk> .
Hier nog een voorbeeld .
Deze cartoon maakt een hoop punten .
Het gaat ook om het leven in het moment , en waarschijnlijk om het te doen .
Maar één punt is dat wanneer je één ding kiest , je kiest niet om andere dingen te doen .
Dat heeft veel aantrekkelijke kenmerken , en het gaat om wat je minder aantrekkelijk doet .
Ten derde : <unk> van verwachtingen .
Dit trof me toen ik mijn <unk> <unk> .
Ik draag de <unk> bijna altijd .
Er was een tijd waarin <unk> in één kleur kwamen , en je kocht ze , en ze <unk> alsof ze <unk> en <unk> , als je ze droeg en <unk> <unk> , begonnen ze te voelen .
Ik begon mijn <unk> na jaren te vervangen door die oude .
Ik zei : &quot; Ik wil een <unk> . Dit is mijn maat . &quot;
De <unk> zei : &quot; Wil je <unk> passen , passen in passen ?
Wil je <unk> vliegen of vliegen ? Wil je <unk> of <unk> ?
Wil je ze <unk> ?
Je wilt <unk> , <unk> , bla bla . \&apos; Op en af .
Mijn <unk> <unk> . En na mijn <unk> zei ik : &quot; Ik wil het soort vroeger zijn . &quot;
Hij had geen idee wat dat was , dus ik heb een uur geprobeerd bij alle <unk> jeans .
Ik liep uit de winkel -- waarheid ! Ik had de <unk> die ik ooit had gehad .
Ik deed het beter . Al deze keuze maakte het mogelijk om beter te doen .
Maar -- ik voelde nog erger .
Waarom ? Ik schreef een heel boek om dit te proberen .
De reden waarom ik nog erger was , is dat , met al deze opties , mijn verwachtingen over hoe goed een <unk> <unk> .
Ik had zeer laag , geen specifieke verwachtingen toen ze alleen in één kleur kwamen .
Toen ze 100 smaken in 100 smaken , was een van hen perfect geweest .
Ik was goed , maar het was niet perfect .
Ik vergeleek wat ik had verwacht wat ik verwachtte , en wat ik had <unk> in vergelijking met wat ik verwachtte .
<unk> opties voor mensen kunnen niet helpen , maar ook de verwachtingen op hoe goed die opties zullen zijn .
Wat dat gaat produceren , is minder tevreden met resultaten , zelfs als ze goede resultaten zijn .
Niemand in de wereld van marketing weet dit .
Het ziet allemaal geweldig . Ik kan niet wachten tot ik teleurgesteld ben .
De waarheid is meer dit .
Alles was beter toen alles erger was ...
De reden dat alles beter was , toen alles erger was , was dat , toen alles erger was , het mogelijk was om ervaringen te hebben die een <unk> verrassing waren .
Tegenwoordig , de wereld waarin we wonen -- we <unk> , <unk> burgers , met <unk> de verwachting -- de beste die je ooit kunt hopen is dat dit zo goed is als je verwacht .
Je zult nooit <unk> worden verrast omdat je verwachtingen , mijn verwachtingen ...
Ik heb het geheim van het geluk , het geheim van geluk -- dit geheim van geluk is lage verwachtingen .
Ik wil zeggen , ik wil zeggen -- een klein <unk> moment -- dat ik eigenlijk getrouwd ben met een vrouw , en ze is heel mooi .
Ik had het niet beter kunnen doen .
Ik heb niet <unk> .
Maar <unk> is niet altijd zo \&apos; n slechte zaak . Een gevolg van een <unk> <unk> <unk> als er maar één soort is om te kopen , en je vraagt waarom .
Ik ben verantwoordelijk .
Het antwoord is duidelijk : de wereld is verantwoordelijk . Wat zou je kunnen doen ?
Als er honderden verschillende <unk> beschikbaar zijn , en je koopt een <unk> en vraag waarom , wie is verantwoordelijk ?
Het is even duidelijk dat het antwoord op de vraag is : &quot; Jij . &quot;
Je had het beter kunnen doen .
Met een honderd verschillende <unk> op display , is er geen excuus voor mislukking .
Als mensen beslissingen nemen , en ook al zijn de resultaten van de beslissingen goed , ze voelen zich <unk> over hen .
Ze zijn het <unk> .
<unk> depressie is <unk> in de industriële wereld in de laatste generatie .
Ik geloof een belangrijk -- niet de enige , maar een belangrijk -- <unk> aan deze explosie van depressie , en ook zelfmoord , is <unk> omdat hun normen zo hoog zijn .
Als ze deze ervaringen moeten uitleggen , denken ze dat ze in het fout zijn .
Het netto resultaat is dat we beter in het algemeen , <unk> , en ons <unk> .
Laat me jullie herinneren .
Dit is de officiële dogma die we allemaal nemen , en het is allemaal fout .
Het is niet waar .
Er is geen twijfel die een beter keuze is dan niemand , maar het volgt niet dat meer keuze is dan een keuze .
Er is een <unk> . Ik weet niet wat het is .
Ik ben er vrij zeker van dat we er lang over hebben , waar opties ons welzijn verhogen .
Nu , als beleid -- ik ben bijna klaar met het beleid van het beleid , het ding om te denken , is dit .
Wat deze keuze maakt in industriële samenlevingen , is <unk> <unk> .
Er zijn veel plekken in de wereld , en we hebben gehoord over enkele van hen , waar hun probleem niet teveel keuze is . Hun probleem is dat ze te weinig hebben .
Waar ik het over heb , is het <unk> probleem van moderne , <unk> , westerse samenlevingen .
Wat zo <unk> en <unk> is : Steve <unk> sprak gisteren over hoe deze dure en <unk> <unk> niet helpen . Het is een verspilling van geld .
Wat ik vertel , is dat deze dure , ingewikkelde keuzes -- niet eenvoudig zijn . Ze <unk> echt .
Ze maken ons <unk> .
Als sommigen van wat mensen in onze samenlevingen kunnen doen om alle keuzes te maken die we maken , zijn mensen te weinig opties , niet alleen voor de levens die het leven hebben verbeterd .
Maar onze maatschappij zou ook verbeterd worden .
Dat noemen economen \&apos; <unk> \&apos; .
<unk> <unk> zal iedereen beter maken -- niet alleen arme mensen -- vanwege hoe al deze <unk> ons <unk> .
Tot slot . \&apos; Je kunt alles zijn wat je wilt -- je moet deze cartoon lezen en een verfijnde persoon zijn , zeg : &quot; Aha ! Wat weet deze vis ?
Weet je , er is niets in deze <unk> . &quot;
<unk> verbeelding , een <unk> blik van de wereld -- en dat is de manier waarop ik het eerst las .
Hoe meer ik erover nadacht , hoe meer ik naar het idee kwam dat deze vis iets weet .
Want de waarheid is dat als je de <unk> <unk> zodat alles mogelijk is , je geen vrijheid hebt .
Als je een <unk> <unk> , dan <unk> je tevreden .
Je <unk> verlamming en je <unk> <unk> .
Iedereen heeft een <unk> nodig .
Deze is bijna zeker te beperkt - misschien zelfs voor de vis , zeker voor ons .
Maar de afwezigheid van een <unk> <unk> is een recept voor ellende , en ik vermoed , ik vermoed , een ramp .
Heel erg bedankt .
Letztes Jahr habe ich diese beiden Bilder gezeigt , die zeigen , dass die <unk> <unk> , die in den meisten letzten drei Millionen Jahren die Größe der unteren 48 Jahre erreicht haben , von 40 % .
Aber es <unk> die ernst dieses Problems , denn es zeigt nicht die <unk> des <unk> .
Die <unk> ist , in gewissem Sinne , das <unk> Herz des globalen <unk> .
Er <unk> im Winter und <unk> im Sommer .
Die nächste Folie , die ich Ihnen zeigen werde , ist eine <unk> <unk> dessen , was in den letzten 25 Jahren passiert ist .
Das <unk> Eis ist rot .
Wie Sie sehen , es erweitert sich auf die dunkle blauen -- das ist das jährliche Eis im Sommer , und es <unk> im Sommer .
Das sogenannte &quot; <unk> &quot; , 5 Jahre alt oder älter Sie können sehen , ist fast wie Blut und <unk> <unk> .
25 Jahre später ist es davon weg .
Das ist ein Problem , denn die Erwärmung der Erde <unk> sich um die Arktis herum , wo es eine gewaltige Menge an <unk> Kohlenstoff gibt , die , wenn sie <unk> , von Mikroben von Mikroben umgeben sind .
<unk> zu der Grenze der globalen Erwärmung in der Atmosphäre , der Betrag könnte verdoppeln , wenn wir diesen Wendepunkt <unk> .
In einigen <unk> in Alaska <unk> Methan <unk> aus dem Wasser .
Professor Walter <unk> von der University of Alaska <unk> mit einem anderen Team in einem anderen Winter .
Video : <unk> !
Und ein Grund ist , dass dieses enorme <unk> auf der Norden von Grönland aus dem Norden gefahren ist .
Das ist ein <unk> Fluss .
Aber die <unk> sind viel größer als je zuvor .
Das ist der <unk> River im Norden Grönland .
Wenn man wissen will , wie der Meeresspiegel auf der Oberfläche von Eis <unk> ist , ist es der See <unk> .
Diese Tendenz steigt sehr schnell .
Auf der anderen Seite des Planeten , der Antarktis , der größte Masse an Eis auf dem Planeten .
Letzten Monat haben Wissenschaftler der gesamten Kontinent im Vergleich zu einem negativen <unk> .
Und der Westen <unk> oben auf einige <unk> Inseln , ist vor allem in der <unk> .
Das ist gleich auf 20 Meter Höhe , wie Grönland .
Im Himalaya befindet sich die dritte große Masse von Eis : oben sehen Sie neue Seen , die Gletscher <unk> .
40 Prozent aller Menschen auf der Welt bekommen die Hälfte ihres Trinkwasser .
In den Baumkronen ist dieser Gletscher die <unk> Wasser für diese Stadt .
Die <unk> haben verbessert .
Aber wenn sie weggehen , also viel Wasser .
In Kalifornien gab es in Kalifornien ein Rückgang von 40 % in der Sierra <unk> .
Das ist die <unk> .
Und die Vorhersagen , wie Sie lesen , sind ernst .
Diese <unk> rund um die Welt führen zu einem <unk> Anstieg in Feuer .
Und die Katastrophen rund um die Welt haben eine absolut außergewöhnliche und <unk> Rate .
Vier Mal so viele in den letzten 30 Jahren .
Das ist ein komplett <unk> Muster .
Wenn Sie sich in den Kontext der Geschichte anschauen können Sie sehen , was das tut .
In den letzten fünf Jahren haben wir jedes Mal 70 Millionen Tonnen CO2 <unk> – 25 Millionen Tonnen CO2 pro Tag .
Betrachten Sie genau das Gebiet des <unk> Pazifik , von den USA , der <unk> , und auf der beiden Seite des indischen <unk> , wo es eine radikale <unk> gibt in den Ozeanen .
Die größte Ursache der Erderwärmung , der mit der Abholzung , der 20 Prozent davon ist der <unk> von fossilen <unk> .
Öl ist ein Problem und Kohle ist das <unk> Problem .
In den USA ist es eines der größten <unk> , mit China .
Und der Vorschlag ist es , viel mehr <unk> zu bauen .
Aber wir fangen ein <unk> an .
Hier sind die , die in den letzten paar Jahren mit einigen grünen Alternativen <unk> wurden .
Es gibt jedoch einen politischen Kampf in unserem Land .
Und die <unk> und die <unk> haben ein Viertel für eine Milliarde Dollar ausgegeben im letzten <unk> Jahr , die ein <unk> <unk> .
Dieses Bild erinnerte mich an etwas .
Um Weihnachten in Tennessee zu Hause in Tennessee <unk> ein <unk> Liter <unk> .
Sie haben es wahrscheinlich gesehen .
Das alles im Land ist der zweitgrößte <unk> in Amerika .
Das passierte bei Weihnachten .
Einer der <unk> in der Werbung war dieser .
Video : <unk> die <unk> ist eine <unk> , glückliche Seele .
Er ist reichlich hier in Amerika und hilft unsere Wirtschaft zu wachsen .
<unk> Sie die <unk> des <unk> .
Er ist erschwinglich und <unk> und Arbeiter halten ihre Bezahlung .
Al Gore : Das ist die Quelle des <unk> in West Virginia .
Der größte <unk> ist der <unk> <unk> .
Video : Don <unk> : Lassen Sie mich darüber klar . Al Gore , Nancy <unk> , Harry <unk> , wissen Sie nicht worüber sie sprechen .
Al Gore : Die Alliance for Climate Protection hat zwei <unk> gegründet .
Das ist eines davon , ein Teil davon .
Video : Akteur : Wir sehen Klimawandel , wir sehen Klimawandel als ernsthafte Bedrohung für unser Unternehmen .
Deshalb haben wir es unser <unk> <unk> , um eine große Summe Geld für <unk> und die Wahrheit über Kohle zu helfen .
Tatsache ist , Kohle ist nicht <unk> .
Wir denken , es ist sauber – auch gut riecht .
Machen Sie sich also keine Sorgen über Klimawandel .
Gehen Sie zu uns .
Video : Akteur : <unk> Kohle – Sie haben viel darüber gehört .
Also lassen Sie uns ein <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Die Maschine ist ziemlich laut .
Aber das ist der Ton von sauberer <unk> .
Und während Kohle Kohle <unk> ist eines der führenden Ursachen der Erderwärmung , die bemerkenswerte saubere <unk> , die Sie hier sehen .
Sehen Sie gut : Das ist die <unk> <unk> .
Al Gore : Endlich , die positiven Alternative <unk> mit unserer Herausforderung und unsere nationale <unk> .
Video : Erzähler : Amerika ist in der Krise – die Wirtschaft , nationale Sicherheit , die klimaatcrisis .
Der Inhalt , der sie alle auf der linken Seite : unsere Abhängigkeit von <unk> , wie <unk> Kohle und <unk> Öl .
Aber jetzt gibt es eine <unk> Lösung für uns .
<unk> Amerika mit 100 % sauberer Strom in 10 Jahren .
Ein Plan , um nach Amerika zu gehen , um uns zu helfen und zu helfen , die Erderwärmung zu helfen .
Zum Schluss eine Lösung , die groß genug ist , um unsere Probleme zu lösen .
<unk> Amerika . <unk> mehr .
Al Gore : Das ist der letzte .
Video : Es geht um die <unk> Amerikas .
Einer der schnellsten Wege , die unsere Abhängigkeit von alten <unk> <unk> , die unseren Planeten zerstören .
Mann : Future ist hier . Wind , Sonne , ein neues <unk> .
Mann 2 : New Investitionen um <unk> Jobs zu schaffen .
Sprecher : <unk> Amerika . Es ist Zeit , es zu <unk> .
Al Gore : Es gibt einen alten afrikanischen <unk> , der sagt : &quot; Wenn Sie schnell gehen wollen , gehen Sie alleine .
Wenn Sie weit gehen wollen , gehen Sie zusammen . &quot;
Wir müssen sehr schnell gehen .
Vielen Dank .
Letztes Jahr bei TED gab ich eine Einführung zum LHC .
Und ich versprochen , zu kommen und Ihnen ein <unk> darüber zu geben , wie diese Maschine funktionierte .
Das ist es . Und für diejenigen , die es nicht gab , ist der LHC das größte wissenschaftliche Experiment , das je versucht hat -- 27 km in <unk> .
Ihre Aufgabe ist es , die Bedingungen zu <unk> , die weniger als eine Sekunde zuvor als <unk> eines <unk> , bis zu 600 Millionen Mal pro Sekunde .
Es ist nicht <unk> .
Das ist die Maschine unter <unk> .
Wir nehmen die Bilder von diesen <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Das ist der Punkt , an dem ich arbeite . Es ist der <unk> Detektor -- 44 Meter breit , <unk> Meter in diameter .
Hier sehen Sie ein Bild von <unk> im Bau , so können Sie die Skala sehen .
Am 10. September <unk> wir das Gerät zum ersten Mal .
Und dieses Bild wurde von <unk> aufgenommen .
Es gab große <unk> im <unk> .
Es ist ein Bild des ersten <unk> , der bis zum LHC <unk> , mit einem Stück des LHC <unk> und <unk> Teilchen in den Detektor .
Mit anderen Worten , als wir dieses Bild am 10. September sahen , wussten wir , dass die Maschine funktionierte , was ein großer Triumph ist .
Ich weiß nicht ob dies die grösste <unk> gab oder das , was jemand auf Google <unk> und so sah .
Es bedeutet , wir haben kulturelle Auswirkungen und wissenschaftlich beeinflusst .
Ungefähr eine Woche später hatten wir ein Problem mit der Maschine , verbunden mit diesen Teilen von Draht -- diese <unk> Kabel .
Diese Kabel haben 13 tausend <unk> <unk> , wenn die Maschine arbeitet .
Die Ingenieure unter Ihnen schauen und sagen : &quot; Nein , das nicht . Es sind kleine <unk> . &quot;
Sie können das tun , denn wenn sie sehr kalt sind , sind sie <unk> .
Also , bei minus <unk> Grad ist es kouder als der Raum zwischen den Sternen . Diese Kabel können diesen Strom nehmen .
In einer der <unk> zwischen über 9.000 <unk> im LHC gab es ein <unk> .
Das Seil <unk> sich leicht und seine <unk> <unk> plötzlich elektrischen Widerstand .
Das war das Ergebnis .
Das ist noch mehr beeindruckend , wenn man diese Magneten über 20 Tonnen wiegen , und sie bewegt einen Fuß .
Wir haben etwa 50 der <unk> <unk> .
Wir mussten sie <unk> , was wir taten .
Wir <unk> sie alle .
Sie sind jetzt alle auf der Straße <unk> .
Am Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts wird der LHC wieder bleiben .
Wir werden es <unk> , und wir erwarten die Daten im Juni oder Juli zu nehmen und mit unserer Suche nach unserer Suche nach <unk> .
Nun , natürlich , auf eine Weise die Unfälle über den Wert von Wissenschaft und Technik am Rand der Wissenschaft <unk> . Es ist leicht zu <unk> .
Ich denke , dass es so schwierig ist , dass es so schwierig ist , dass wir <unk> sind .
Ich werde das letzte Wort an einen englischen Wissenschaftler verlassen , der ich vermute , dass ich vermute , wann ich die <unk> Experimente nicht <unk> habe - seine <unk> war Michael <unk> - sagte : &quot; Nichts ist so gefährlich für den Fortschritt des menschlichen Geistes , dass es keine Geheimnisse gibt in der Natur , dass es keine Geheimnisse gibt , und dass es keine neue Welten gibt , die zu <unk> sind . &quot;
Vielen Dank .
Ich möchte Sie bitten , Sie zu bitten , zu fragen , wann Sie ein Kind wären , mit <unk> .
Und wenn Sie herausgefunden haben , wie man sich <unk> und <unk> und <unk> <unk> , dann lernte man , wie man denkt und zu verstehen und <unk> <unk> und <unk> Beziehungen zu bearbeiten .
<unk> Denken ist zutiefst verbunden mit dem , wie wir die Welt um uns herum verstehen .
Als ein <unk> von unserem Interaktionen , mit physischen Objekten -- zusammen mit meinen <unk> <unk> , und meine Mitarbeiter <unk> <unk> -- ich begann mich zu fragen -- was , wenn wir einen Computer benutzen würden , anstelle eines <unk> , der ein <unk> <unk> , was wenn wir in Kontakt mit beiden Händen und <unk> Informationen <unk> können .
<unk> Sie es wie wir wollten ?
Diese Frage war so <unk> , dass wir entschieden haben , die Antwort zu erforschen , indem wir <unk> bauen .
Kurz gesagt , ein <unk> Computer ist ein <unk> Computer die Größe eines <unk> .
Sie können sich von Hand bewegen , um sich von Hand zu bewegen , sie können sich gegenseitig fühlen , sie können ihre Bewegungen spüren und ein <unk> Radio haben .
Das Wichtigste ist , sie sind physisch , also wie die <unk> , Sie können sie <unk> und <unk> .
Und <unk> sind ein Beispiel für ein neues Ökosystem des <unk> , um digitale Informationen zu manipulieren .
Und wenn diese Werkzeuge physisch sind , sich bewusst bewusst ihrer Bewegung , sich bewusst zu sein und uns bewusst zu sein , wie wir sie bewegen , dann können wir beginnen , neue und <unk> <unk> zu erforschen .
Ich werde mit einigen einfachen Beispielen beginnen .
Diese <unk> ist <unk> , um Video zu zeigen , und wenn ich es in eine Richtung in eine Richtung <unk> , wird es so ein Video rollen ; wenn ich es auf die andere Weise <unk> .
Und diese <unk> sind sich bewusst .
Wenn ich sie nebeneinander stelle , interessieren sie sich .
Wenn sie <unk> werden , bemerken Sie auch , dass sie ein wenig <unk> können .
Und sie können auch ihre Bewegung spüren und <unk> .
Einer der interessanten Auswirkungen auf der Interaktion , wir begannen zu erkennen , dass wir jeden Tag mit Daten kommunizieren könnten , wie wir eine Farbe <unk> können .
In diesem Fall haben wir drei <unk> <unk> <unk> , und ich kann sie benutzen , um die Farbe in die Mitte zu bringen , wo sie <unk> .
Wenn wir <unk> , können wir ein bisschen <unk> <unk> .
Es gibt auch einige nette Möglichkeiten für Bildung , wie Sprache , Mathe und Logik , wo wir Menschen die Dinge schnell versuchen wollen , und sofort sofort sehen .
Hier ist ein <unk> , das ich mit einem einfachen <unk> mache .
Hier haben wir ein Spiel mit einer <unk> zwischen <unk> und <unk> .
In jeder Runde bekommt man einen <unk> Brief auf jeden einzelnen <unk> und während man versucht , Wörter zu erfinden , die gegen ein Wörterbuch <unk> .
Dann , nach etwa 30 Sekunden , <unk> es , und es gibt eine neue Reihe von Buchstaben und neue Möglichkeiten .
Vielen Dank .
Das sind einige Kinder , die ein <unk> zum Media Lab <unk> und ich konnte sie <unk> und ein Video machen .
Sie liebten es wirklich .
Und eines der interessanten Dinge über diese Anwendung ist , dass man nicht viele Anweisungen geben muss .
Sie müssen nur sagen : &quot; Mach <unk> &quot; und sie wissen genau , was zu tun ist .
Hier sind ein paar Leute , die es ausprobieren .
Das ist unser <unk> <unk> , oben rechts .
Es stellte sich heraus , dass alles , was er wollte , den <unk> <unk> .
Für ihn waren sie nur <unk> .
Das ist ein <unk> <unk> .
Wir wollten ein <unk> für <unk> bauen .
Und das ist tatsächlich <unk> .
Und er kann neue Charaktere in die Szene bringen , nur indem man die <unk> von dem Tisch <unk> .
Hier sieht man die Sonne aus .
David <unk> : Er hat einen <unk> in die Szene <unk> .
Gut gemacht ! Ja !
DM : Also , indem man die <unk> <unk> und sie neben einander <unk> kann , kann man die Charaktere interagieren – Video : <unk> !
DM : Schreiben Sie seine eigene Geschichte .
DM : Es ist eine offene Geschichte und entscheiden , wie es sich <unk> .
DM : Das letzte Beispiel , das ich Ihnen heute zeigen habe , ist eine <unk> und live <unk> , die wir vor kurzem haben , wie <unk> , wie Geräusche wie <unk> , <unk> und <unk> .
Jede von ihnen hat vier verschiedene Variationen , die man wählen will .
Und man kann diese Töne <unk> in eine Sequenz , die man ins Muster bringen kann , die man will .
Und man kann es <unk> , indem man den Klang <unk> gegen einen <unk> <unk> .
Es gibt Symptome , die Sie kontrollieren können , wie <unk> und Filter .
Sie befestigen es auf ein bestimmtes Geräusch und dann <unk> sie .
Und dann , bei der allgemeinen Effekte wie Tempo und Umfang , die auf die ganze Sequenz passen .
Schauen wir mal .
Video : DM : Wir beginnen , ein <unk> in zwei <unk> zu packen und sie in eine Reihe zu bringen , <unk> und <unk> .
Jetzt habe ich eine <unk> <unk> .
Video : DM : Jetzt werde ich ein paar <unk> <unk> .
Video : DM : Und jetzt <unk> ich den Filter an den <unk> , also kann ich den Effekt <unk> .
Video : DM : Ich kann die ganze Sequenz beschleunigen , indem ich die <unk> <unk> kann .
Video : DM : Und jetzt <unk> ich den Filter zum <unk> für einen <unk> .
Video : DM : Ich kann die Sequenz öffnen während sie spielt .
Also muss ich es nicht im Fortschritt planen , aber ich kann es <unk> oder kürzer machen , solange ich gehe .
Und nun kann ich die ganze Sequenz <unk> , indem ich die <unk> <unk> und links <unk> .
Vielen Dank .
Wie Sie sehen können , ist meine Leidenschaft für neue <unk> <unk> , die ein besserer Umgang mit unseren Gehirnen und Körper funktionieren .
Und heute habe ich Zeit , Ihnen einen Punkt zu zeigen in diesem neuen <unk> und ein paar Möglichkeiten , die wir am Labor <unk> .
Der Gedanke , dass ich Sie also verlassen will , ist , dass wir auf der <unk> von dieser neuen Generation von Werkzeugen arbeiten , die in unsere Welt <unk> werden müssen .
Vielen Dank .
Ich freue mich darauf , mit all Ihnen zu reden .
Ich bin Schriftsteller .
Bücher sind mein Beruf , aber es ist natürlich mehr als das .
Es ist auch meine große Liebe und fasziniert .
Und ich erwarte nicht , dass das jemals ändern wird .
Aber das sagte , etwas <unk> ist vor kurzem in meinem Leben und in meiner Karriere , die mich zu meiner ganzen Beziehung zu dieser Arbeit <unk> .
Und das besondere Sache ist , dass ich neulich dieses Buch geschrieben habe , das &quot; Essen , <unk> , Love &quot; <unk> in der Welt von einer meiner früheren Bücher in der Welt <unk> , und dieses große , <unk> und internationale <unk> .
Das Ergebnis davon ist , dass ich die Menschen <unk> , wie ich <unk> bin .
ernst – <unk> , <unk> !
Wie kommen sie jetzt zu mir , alle besorgt und sagen : &quot; <unk> Sie nicht , dass Sie es nicht <unk> werden können ?
Sie haben nicht Angst vor dem , was Sie für Ihr ganzes Leben lang schreiben werden , und Sie werden niemals wieder ein Buch erschaffen , der überall auf der Welt interessiert ist ? &quot;
Das ist also <unk> .
Aber es wäre schlimmer zu sein , außer dass ich mich erinnere , dass ich mich vor 20 Jahren erinnere , als ich ein Teenager war , als ich anfing , Leute zu erzählen , die ich <unk> wollte , ich war mit einer ähnlichen <unk> Reaktion .
Und die Leute sagen : &quot; <unk> Sie nicht , dass Sie einen Erfolg haben ?
<unk> Sie nicht Angst vor dem <unk> der <unk> ?
<unk> Sie nicht vor , dass Sie Ihr ganzes Leben <unk> werden in diesem <unk> , und nichts wird es jemals passieren und Sie sterben auf einen <unk> von <unk> Träumen mit Ihrem Mund voller <unk> <unk> von <unk> ? &quot;
So ...
Die Antwort -- die kurze Antwort auf all diese Fragen ist : &quot; Ja . &quot;
Ja , ich fürchte all diese Dinge .
Und ich war immer schon .
Und ich fürchte , viele weitere Dinge können noch nicht mal erraten , wie <unk> und andere Dinge beängstigend sind .
Aber wenn es um das Schreiben geht , worüber ich schon seit kurzem nachdenke , frage ich mich , warum ?
Wissen Sie , ist es rational ?
Ist es logisch , dass jemand erwartet werden sollte , dass man vor der Arbeit Angst vor der Arbeit <unk> .
Und es ist besonders an der kreativen <unk> , die uns sehr nervös über die mentale Gesundheit von der Gesundheit <unk> .
Wie mein Vater , zum Beispiel , ein <unk> Ingenieur und ich erinnere mich nicht an einmal in seinen 40 Jahren an chemischen <unk> .
&quot; Dieser <unk> <unk> , John , wie geht es ? &quot;
Es kam einfach nicht so .
Aber es sind <unk> , chemische Ingenieure als Gruppe nicht wirklich einen Ruf haben über die Jahrhunderte , um <unk> <unk> zu sein .
Wir haben <unk> , wir haben einen Ruf und nicht nur Autoren , sondern auch <unk> Menschen in allen <unk> , es scheint , dass es einen Ruf für unglaublich <unk> <unk> ist .
Und alles was Sie tun müssen , ist die <unk> <unk> im 20. Jahrhundert im 20. Jahrhundert , von einem wirklich <unk> Geist , der junge und oft in ihren eigenen Händen <unk> .
Und selbst diejenigen , die nicht einmal Selbstmord begangen haben , scheinen wirklich <unk> zu sein .
Norman <unk> , kurz bevor er starb , war letztes Interview , er sagte : &quot; Jede meiner Bücher hat mich <unk> . &quot;
Eine außergewöhnlich Aussage , um es zu schaffen .
Aber wir schreiben nicht mal , wenn wir jemanden sagen , das es so lange hört , denn wir haben das so lange gehört und wir haben komplett <unk> und <unk> , dass Kreativität und Leiden irgendwie verbunden sind und das <unk> , am Ende , führt immer zu <unk> .
Und die Frage , die ich alle heute fragen möchte , ist Sie alle <unk> mit dieser Idee ?
Ist es mir egal ?
Denn Sie sehen es sogar von einem Zentimeter entfernt und , wissen Sie , ich bin nicht <unk> mit dieser Annahme .
Ich denke es ist <unk> .
Und ich denke auch , es ist gefährlich und ich will es nicht ins nächste Jahrhundert sehen .
Ich denke es ist besser , wenn wir unseren kreativen Geist <unk> müssen .
Und ich weiß definitiv , dass ich in meiner Lage bin – es wäre sehr gefährlich für mich in meiner Situation , die ich in der Lage bin , die <unk> weg zu dringen , vor allem die Bedingungen , die ich gerade in meiner Karriere bin .
Das ist – Wissen Sie , wie Sie es wissen , ich bin ziemlich jung , ich bin ziemlich jung .
Ich habe noch ein paar weitere Jahrzehnte Arbeit <unk> .
Und es ist wahrscheinlich <unk> , dass alles , was ich von diesem Punkt geschrieben habe , von der Welt <unk> wird , wie die Arbeit , die nach dem <unk> Erfolg des letzten Buches kam , nicht wahr ?
Ich sollte es nur <unk> , denn wir sind jetzt alle Freunde – es ist wahrscheinlich <unk> , dass mein <unk> Erfolg hinter mir ist .
Jesus , was ein Gedanke !
Das ist die Art von Gedanken , die einen Menschen führen könnten , um <unk> um neun Uhr morgens zu trinken und ich will nicht dorthin gehen .
Ich würde lieber diese Arbeit halten , die ich liebe .
Und so wird die Frage , wie ?
Und so scheint es zu mir zu viel <unk> , so wie ich jetzt arbeite , um weiter zu schreiben , dass ich ein <unk> psychologische <unk> schaffen muss .
Ich muss einen Weg finden , eine sichere Distanz zwischen mir zu haben , während ich schreibe , und meine ganz natürliche Ängste darüber , was die Reaktion auf das Schreiben ist .
Und , wie ich schon im letzten Jahr , zum Beispiel , für Modelle , wie man es tun kann . Ich habe versucht , andere Gesellschaften zu finden , um zu sehen , ob sie vielleicht bessere und <unk> Ideen haben können , als wir es haben , kreativ zu helfen , die kreative Gefühle von Kreativität <unk> .
Und diese Suche führte mich zu alten Griechenland und <unk> Rom .
Also bleiben Sie mit mir , denn es bewegt sich und zurück .
Aber alte Griechenland und <unk> Rom -- die Menschen nicht glauben , dass Kreativität von Menschen damals kam , OK ?
Menschen glaubten , dass Kreativität diesen <unk> <unk> , der zu Menschen kam , von einer <unk> Quelle .
Die Griechen sind bekannt als diese <unk> <unk> Geister der Kreativität &quot; <unk> &quot; .
<unk> , <unk> , glaubte ich , dass er einen <unk> hatte , der Weisheit an ihm <unk> .
Die <unk> hatte die gleiche Idee , aber sie nannten es ein <unk> kreativer Geist ein Genie .
Das ist großartig , denn die <unk> glaubten nicht , dass ein Genie ein besonders <unk> Mensch war .
Sie glaubten , dass ein Genie das war , ein <unk> <unk> Einheit , der vor buchstäblich in den Wänden eines Künstler <unk> , ein bisschen wie das Haus <unk> , und ein bisschen <unk> am Künstler <unk> .
Es ist so brilliant – da ist es , da es die Distanz von dem ich spreche – die psychologische Konstruktion um Sie zu schützen .
Und alle wussten , dass es so <unk> ist .
Der alte Künstler wurde von bestimmten Dingen geschützt , z. B. zu viel <unk> .
Wenn Ihre Arbeit brilliant war , können Sie nicht alle <unk> dafür nehmen , alle wussten , dass Sie dieses <unk> Genie haben , der Sie unterstützen können .
Wenn Ihre Arbeit <unk> , nicht komplett Ihre Schuld .
Jeder wusste , dass Ihr Genie ziemlich <unk> war .
Und so geht es darum , wie Leute über Kreativität im Westen dachten ,
Und dann kam die Renaissance und alles änderte sich . Wir hatten eine große Idee und die große Idee war , und der große Gedanke war , dass wir die individuelle Person im Zentrum des Universums <unk> und es nicht mehr Raum für <unk> Wesen gibt , die <unk> von der <unk> .
Und es ist der Anfang des <unk> <unk> , und die Leute begannen zu glauben , dass Kreativität vollständig vom Selbst getrennt wurde .
Und zum ersten Mal in der Geschichte , fangen Sie an , Leute zu hören oder die Künstler zu <unk> , anstatt als Genie zu sein .
Und ich muss sagen , ich denke , das war ein riesiger Fehler .
Wissen Sie , ich denke , das erlaubt jemand , eine Person zu glauben , zu glauben , dass er oder sie ist wie die <unk> und die Essenz von allen <unk> , die Quelle von all der <unk> , kreativ , <unk> , <unk> mysterie ist nur ein <unk> , der zu viel Verantwortung <unk> .
Es ist , wie man jemanden fragt , der die Sonne <unk> .
Es ist völlig <unk> und <unk> <unk> und es schafft all diese <unk> Erwartungen über Performance .
Und ich denke , der Druck ist der Druck , der unsere Künstler seit den letzten 500 Jahren getötet hat .
Und wenn das stimmt , und ich denke , es stimmt , die Frage ist , was ?
Können wir das anders machen ?
Vielleicht zurück zu einem <unk> Verständnis der Beziehung zwischen Mensch und kreativen Rätsel .
Vielleicht nicht .
Vielleicht können wir nicht nur 500 Jahre lang <unk> <unk> denken in eine <unk> Minute .
Und es gibt wahrscheinlich Leute in diesem Publikum , der wirklich <unk> wissenschaftlichen <unk> über die Idee der Menschen <unk> <unk> <unk> über ihren Projekten und Zeug .
Ich bin nicht , wahrscheinlich werde ich Ihnen alle damit weitermachen .
Aber die Frage , die ich möchte , ist -- wissen Sie , warum nicht ?
Warum nicht darüber nachdenken ?
Denn es ist so viel Sinn wie alles , was ich jemals gehört habe , um die <unk> <unk> <unk> des kreativen Prozesses zu erklären .
Ein Prozess , der , wie jeder , der jemals versucht hat , etwas zu erschaffen -- nämlich im Grunde , dass man nicht immer <unk> <unk> .
Und tatsächlich kann man manchmal <unk> <unk> .
Ich hatte vor kurzem dieses Treffen , wo ich den außergewöhnlichen amerikanischen Dichter <unk> , der heute in ihren 90ern war , aber sie war ein Dichter ihr ganzes Leben lang und erzählte mir , dass als sie in ländlichen Virginia aufgewachsen war , und sie sagte , sie <unk> sich und hörte ein Gedicht aus .
Und sie sagte , es war wie ein <unk> <unk> .
Und sie <unk> auf die Landschaft über die Landschaft .
Und sie fühlte es sich an , denn es <unk> die Erde unter ihren Füßen .
Sie wusste , dass sie nur etwas zu tun hatte , und das war , in ihren Worten , in ihren Worten &quot; <unk> &quot; .
Und sie rannte wie hell ins Haus und sie würde von diesem Gedicht <unk> werden . Und das ganze Angebot war , dass sie bis zu einem Stück Papier und einen Stift schnell <unk> , so dass sie es <unk> und auf der Seite <unk> können .
Und sie wollte nicht schnell genug sein , also <unk> sie und rennen , und sie würde nicht ins Haus gehen und das Gedicht <unk> , und sie <unk> es und sagte , es würde sich auf der Landschaft <unk> , und sie sagte , es würde sich für einen anderen Dichter <unk> .
Und dann gab es diese Zeiten – das ist das Stück , das ich nie vergessen habe – sie sagte , es gäbe Momente , die sie fast verpasst haben .
Also , sie rennt ins Haus und sie sucht nach dem Papier und <unk> sie , und sie <unk> einen Stift und sie sagte , es war so , als ob sie mit ihrer anderen Hand <unk> und sie <unk> .
Sie <unk> das Gedicht von Schwanz und <unk> sie in ihrem Körper , während sie auf der Seite <unk> .
Und in diesen Fällen sollte das Gedicht perfekt erscheinen und <unk> erscheinen , aber rückwärts , vom letzten Wort zum ersten Mal .
Als ich hörte , dass ich -- das ist <unk> , das meine kreative Aufgabe ist .
Das ist nicht alles was mein kreativer Prozess ist – ich bin nicht die <unk> !
Ich bin ein <unk> und der Weg , wie ich arbeite , muss ich jeden Tag aufstehen und <unk> und <unk> und <unk> und <unk> .
Aber selbst ich , in meinem <unk> , habe ich schon mal <unk> .
Und ich stelle mir vor , dass es viele von Ihnen gibt .
Wissen Sie , selbst ich habe Arbeit oder Ideen <unk> von einer Quelle , die ich nicht <unk> kann .
Und was ist das ?
Und wie können wir uns auf eine Weise entscheiden , die uns nicht <unk> , aber in Wahrheit könnte es uns helfen ?
Und für mich ist das beste <unk> Beispiel , wie ich das tun kann , ist der Musiker von Tom <unk> , der ich vor einigen Jahren auf einer <unk> <unk> .
Und wir sprachen darüber und wissen Sie , Tom , für das meiste seines Lebens war er ziemlich die <unk> des <unk> moderner Künstler , und zu kontrollieren und zu kontrollieren und zu kontrollieren und diese <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Aber dann wurde er älter , er wurde <unk> , und eines Tages fuhr er auf die Autobahn in Los Angeles . Und das ist , wenn es sich alles geändert hat .
Und er beschleunigt sich , und plötzlich hört er ein kleines Stück von Melodie , der in seinem Kopf kommt , so <unk> und <unk> , und er will es , es ist wunderbar und <unk> . Und er kann es nicht schaffen .
Er hat kein Blatt Papier oder ein <unk> oder ein <unk> .
Und so beginnt er all diese alte Angst zu <unk> in ihm : &quot; Ich werde dieses Ding verlieren und ich werde von diesem Lied <unk> werden .
Ich bin nicht gut genug und kann es nicht schaffen . &quot;
Und anstatt zu <unk> war er einfach .
Er <unk> diesen ganzen geistigen Prozess und er machte etwas völlig Neues .
Er schaute nur an den Himmel und sagte : &quot; Entschuldigung , kannst du nicht sehen , dass ich fahre ? &quot;
&quot; Sehen Sie , wie ich heute ein Lied <unk> können ?
Wenn Sie wirklich existieren wollen , kommen Sie in einem <unk> Moment zurück , wenn ich mich um Sie kümmerte .
<unk> Sie bitte jemand anderen .
Machen Sie bitte Leonard Cohen . &quot;
Und seine ganze Arbeit <unk> sich danach .
Nicht die Arbeit . Die Arbeit war immer noch so dunkel wie je zuvor .
Aber der Prozess , und der schwere Angst um ihn herum wurde <unk> , als er den Geist <unk> , der es nicht außer dem Problem verursacht hatte , und es <unk> , wo es herauskam , dass es nicht dieses <unk> sein musste , <unk> Ding .
Es könnte diese seltsame , seltsame und bizarre Zusammenarbeit sein , ein Dialog zwischen Tom und dem seltsamen , <unk> Ding , der nicht recht Tom war .
Als ich diese Geschichte hörte , begann es mir ein wenig zu verändern , wie ich auch arbeitete und diese Idee <unk> .
Es rettete mich , als ich mitten in der Nacht &quot; Eat , <unk> Love Love &quot; war , und ich fiel in eine der <unk> von Verzweiflung , die wir alle <unk> , wenn wir an etwas arbeiten , und es nicht <unk> , und man beginnt zu denken , dass es ein Desaster sein wird , das das schlimmste Buch je geschrieben hat .
Nicht nur schlecht , aber das schlimmste Buch , das je geschrieben hat .
Und ich dachte , ich solle dieses Projekt <unk> .
Aber dann erinnerte ich mich an Tom <unk> <unk> und ich versuchte es .
Also <unk> ich mich <unk> vom <unk> und <unk> mir meine Kommentare an einen leeren Winkel des Raums .
Und ich sagte <unk> : &quot; Hören Sie und ich weiß beide , dass wenn dieses Buch nicht brilliant ist , das nicht völlig meine Schuld ist .
Denn Sie können sehen , dass ich alles zeige , ich habe nicht mehr mehr als das .
Wenn Sie wollen , dass es besser sein will , müssen Sie <unk> und Ihr Teil des <unk> machen .
Aber wenn Sie das nicht tun , wissen Sie , was Sie nicht tun wollen .
Ich werde trotzdem schreiben , denn das ist mein Job .
Und ich würde bitte gern den Rekord vorstellen , wie ich mich für mein <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Denn am Ende ist es so wie es so - vor Jahrhunderten - vor Jahrhunderten in den <unk> von North Afrika , um die <unk> von heilige Tanz und Musik zu sammeln , bis zu Beginn .
Sie waren immer großartig , denn die Tänzer waren <unk> und sie waren großartig .
Aber jedes Mal , wenn man einmal in eine Weile war , würde etwas passieren und eine dieser Künstler <unk> werden .
Und ich weiß , Sie wissen schon , worüber ich spreche , denn ich weiß , Sie wissen schon , Sie haben schon einmal gesehen , wie Sie alle gesehen haben .
Es war so , wie die Zeit <unk> , und der Tänzer sollte einen Schritt <unk> werden und nicht anders als je zuvor , 1000 Nächte zuvor , aber alles würde <unk> .
Und plötzlich scheint es nicht länger menschlich zu sein .
Er <unk> sich hinein und <unk> von unten und <unk> und <unk> in Feuer .
Und als das passierte , dann wussten die Leute es für das was es war , wissen Sie , sie nannten es am Namen .
Sie würden ihre Hände <unk> und <unk> werden : &quot; Allah , Allah , Gott , Gott , Gott , Gott . &quot;
Das ist Gott .
<unk> historischen <unk> : als die <unk> <unk> <unk> , haben sie diese <unk> mit ihnen <unk> und die <unk> über die Jahrhunderte von Allah , <unk> , zu &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> &quot; , in <unk> und in <unk> <unk> .
In Spanien , als ein Künstler etwas Unmögliche und Magie getan hat : &quot; Gott , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> &quot; , es ist ein Blick auf Gott .
Das ist toll , denn wir brauchen das .
Aber der schwierige Teil ist am nächsten Morgen , für die Tänzer selbst , wenn er sich <unk> und <unk> , dass es um elf Uhr morgens <unk> wird . Und er ist nicht länger einen Einblick in Gott .
Er ist nur ein <unk> <unk> mit sehr schlechten Augen und vielleicht wird er nie wieder auf die Höhe gehen .
Und vielleicht wird niemand jemals wieder Gottes Name <unk> , während er sich dreht , und was er dann mit dem Rest seines Lebens tun kann ?
Das ist schwer .
Das ist eines der <unk> <unk> , um in einem kreativen Leben zu verwandeln .
Aber vielleicht muss es nicht so voller <unk> sein , wenn man zuvor nicht zu glauben war , dass die meisten außergewöhnlichen Aspekte von Ihnen gekommen sind .
Aber vielleicht , wenn man nur glaubt , dass sie auf einer <unk> Quelle von <unk> Quelle für ein <unk> Teil Ihres Lebens sind , wenn man fertig ist , wenn man fertig ist , mit jemand anderem .
Und wissen Sie , wenn wir darüber nachdenken , es beginnt alles zu ändern .
So habe ich begonnen zu denken , wie ich in den letzten Jahren gedacht habe , wie ich in den letzten Jahren gearbeitet habe , während ich am Ende des Buches gearbeitet habe , der <unk> , wie der <unk> , der <unk> <unk> folgen kann .
Und ich muss immer weiter sagen , wenn ich mich wirklich nicht <unk> habe , ist es nicht <unk> .
Seien Sie nicht <unk> . Machen Sie Ihre Arbeit .
Um es zu verdeutlichen , was auch immer das sein könnte .
Wenn Ihr Job zu tanzen ist , machen Sie Ihr Tanz .
Wenn der <unk> , <unk> Genie <unk> hat , entscheiden sich , ein bisschen <unk> <unk> zu lassen , kurz vor dem <unk> , dann &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
Und wenn nicht , dann <unk> deinen Tanz .
Und &quot; <unk> ! &quot; zu mögen .
Ich glaube das und ich denke , wir müssen es lehren .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; bis zu Ihnen , aber nur für die <unk> menschliche Liebe und <unk> .
Vielen Dank .
Vielen Dank .
June Cohen : <unk> !
Wissen Sie , ich habe schon über einige dieser Projekte gesprochen – über das menschliche Genom und was das bedeuten könnte und neue <unk> Gene .
Wir beginnen zu einem neuen Punkt : Wir haben Biologie <unk> , und jetzt versuchen wir , von dem digitalen Code in eine neue Phase der Biologie zu gehen und zu erschaffen .
Wir haben immer versucht , große Fragen zu stellen .
&quot; Was ist Leben ? &quot; ist etwas , das ich denke , viele Biologen haben versucht , auf verschiedene Ebenen zu verstehen .
Wir haben verschiedene Ansätze ausprobiert und <unk> <unk> .
Wir haben es nun seit fast 20 Jahren <unk> , als wir das menschliche Genom <unk> , es ging von der <unk> Welt der Biologie in die digitale Welt des Computers .
Wir versuchen zu fragen : &quot; Können wir Leben regenerieren oder können wir neue Leben aus diesem digitalen Universum erschaffen ? &quot;
Das ist die Karte eines kleinen Organismus , <unk> <unk> , das das kleinste Genom für eine Spezies , die im Labor <unk> können . Wir haben versucht , zu sehen , ob wir ein noch kleinere Genome <unk> können .
Wir können die Reichweite von 100 Gene aus den 500 oder so weiter ausschalten .
Wenn wir uns auf seine <unk> Karte anschauen , ist es relativ <unk> verglichen mit unserer <unk> -- es ist einfach , aber wenn wir uns alle Gene anschauen , die wir eines Tages <unk> können , dann ist es sehr unwahrscheinlich , dass dies eine lebende Zelle liefert .
Also entschieden wir uns , die einzig mögliche Methode zu <unk> , um dieses <unk> <unk> Fragen zu stellen .
Und so fingen wir an : Können wir ein <unk> <unk> ?
Kann es die <unk> ermöglichen , die wir noch nie zuvor sind ?
Und wenn wir es tun , können wir ein <unk> <unk> ?
Ein <unk> ist ein <unk> <unk> Material .
Unsere Geschwindigkeit des <unk> Lebens ist also mit einer exponentiell Geschwindigkeit .
Unsere Fähigkeit , den genetischen Code zu schreiben , bewegt sich ziemlich langsam , aber unser letzter Punkt ist es , ein <unk> Kurve .
Wir haben das vor 15 Jahren begonnen .
Es dauerte einige Phasen in der letzten Versuche , bevor wir die ersten Experimente machten .
Aber es stellt sich heraus , dass <unk> sehr schwierig ist .
Es gibt Tausende von Maschinen auf der Welt , die kleine Stücke von DNS machen – 30 bis 50 Buchstaben in die Länge – und es ist ein <unk> Prozess , also je länger man das Stück macht , desto mehr Fehler gibt es .
Wir mussten also eine neue Methode entwerfen , um diese kleinen Teile <unk> und alle Fehler zu korrigieren .
Und dies war unser erster Versuch , mit der digitalen Information des Genoms des <unk> <unk> .
Es ist ein kleines Virus , das Bakterien tötet .
Wir haben die Teile <unk> und <unk> <unk> und ein <unk> von etwa 5.000 Buchstaben .
Die aufregende Phase kam , als wir dieses Stück <unk> <unk> und ihn in den Bakterien stellten , und die Bakterien fingen an , diesen genetischen Code zu lesen .
Die <unk> Partikel wurden von den Zellen freigesetzt und den E. <unk> <unk> .
Vor kurzem sprach ich mit der <unk> und ich sagte , sie seien das Modell .
Sie lachten mehr als Sie sind . Und so denken wir , es ist eine Situation , in der die Software seine eigene Hardware in einem biologischen System aufbaut .
Aber wir wollten viel weiter gehen : wir wollten das gesamte <unk> <unk> – es ist über <unk> <unk> des genetischen Codes – also wir dachten , wir hätten sie in der Größe der Viren <unk> , um zu verstehen , was die eigentlichen Komponenten eines lebenden Zellen sind .
Design ist entscheidend und wenn man mit digitalen Informationen im Computer beginnt , die digitale Information wirklich richtig korrekt zu sein .
Als wir das Genom 1995 <unk> , war der Standard der Genauigkeit eines <unk> <unk> .
Wir haben wirklich herausgefunden , wie wir es haben , 30 Fehler zu machen ; wir haben diese ursprüngliche Sequenz nicht <unk> können .
Ein Teil des Designs besteht aus Teilen , die von 50 Buchstaben lange <unk> sind , die sich <unk> müssen , um kleinere <unk> zu bauen , die wir <unk> müssen .
Wir entwerfen einzigartige Elemente .
Sie haben vielleicht gelesen , dass wir <unk> haben .
Denken Sie darüber nach : Wir haben einen <unk> genetischen Code – A , C , G und T.
<unk> von diesen Buchstaben Code für nahezu 20 <unk> , so dass es ein einziger <unk> für jede der <unk> gibt .
Wir können also den genetischen Code nutzen , um Wörter , Sätze und Gedanken zu schreiben .
<unk> , wir haben es <unk> .
Manche Menschen waren enttäuscht .
Wir haben diese Stücke <unk> , so wir können mit <unk> <unk> <unk> ; es gibt <unk> , die sie <unk> und <unk> .
Und wir begannen , Teile zu bauen , angefangen mit Stücke , die 5.000 bis zu 7.000 Buchstaben waren , um die <unk> Stücke zu bauen , und dann <unk> sie die <unk> .
Bei jeder Bühne <unk> wir diese Teile in Überfluss und wir können sie <unk> , denn wir versuchen , ein Prozess zu erzeugen , der sehr robust ist , dass man in eine Minute sehen kann .
Wir versuchen , auf die <unk> zu gelangen .
Das sieht also aus wie ein <unk> .
Wenn wir in diese sehr große Teile über 100 000 <unk> <unk> werden können , werden sie nicht länger in der E <unk> – es <unk> alle modernen Werkzeuge der molekularen Biologie – und so haben wir uns auf andere Mechanismen <unk> .
Wir wussten , es gibt einen Mechanismus namens <unk> <unk> , der Biologie verwendet , um DNS zu reparieren .
Hier ist ein Beispiel : Es gibt ein <unk> namens <unk> <unk> , der drei Millionen <unk> <unk> kann .
Sie können oben sehen , dass ihr <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> bis zu 24 Stunden später , es <unk> es genau wie zuvor .
Wir haben tausende Organismen .
Diese Organismen können vollkommen <unk> sein ; sie können in einem Vakuum leben .
Ich bin absolut sicher , dass Leben im Weltall existieren kann , um sich <unk> und eine neue <unk> Umwelt zu finden .
Tatsächlich hat NASA viel davon gezeigt .
Hier ist ein <unk> <unk> des Molekül , mit dem wir diese Prozesse benutzen , mit dem richtigen Design der Teile der Teile , die sie <unk> ; Hefe <unk> sie automatisch .
Das ist kein <unk> ; das ist nur ein <unk> <unk> .
Es ist ein großes Molekül , das wir mit einem <unk> sehen können .
Das sind Bilder über eine <unk> Periode .
Das ist die <unk> vor kurzem .
Das ist über <unk> Buchstaben des genetischen Codes ; es ist die grösste Moleküle , die je von Menschen eines <unk> <unk> .
Es ist über 300 Millionen molekularen <unk> .
Wenn wir es bei einem 10 <unk> <unk> ohne <unk> <unk> , braucht es <unk> Seiten nur um diesen genetischen Code .
Nun , wie können wir ein <unk> <unk> ? Wie können wir das aktivieren ?
Natürlich ist es mit einem Virus ziemlich einfach ; es ist viel komplizierter , es ist viel komplizierter .
Es ist auch einfacher , wenn wir in <unk> wie uns selbst gehen : Sie können einfach den Kern und den <unk> <unk> .
Mit Bakterien und <unk> ist das <unk> in die Zelle integriert , aber wir haben neulich gezeigt , dass wir eine komplette <unk> eines <unk> von einer Zelle und sie aktivieren .
Wir haben ein <unk> von einer <unk> Spezies <unk> – grob gesagt , diese beiden sind so weit entfernt als menschliche und Mäuse – wir haben ein paar weitere Gene <unk> , um all den Proteine zu töten und zu <unk> , und es war ziemlich beeindruckend , wenn wir es in die Zelle stellten – und Sie werden unsere sehr <unk> Grafik <unk> .
Das neue <unk> <unk> in die Zelle .
Wir dachten sogar , das könnte soweit sein , aber wir versuchten , den Prozess etwas weiter zu gestalten .
Das ist ein wichtiger Mechanismus der Evolution .
Wir finden alle Arten von Spezies , die ein zweites <unk> oder ein Drittel von uns <unk> haben und tausende neue Eigenschaften hinzufügen .
Menschen , die von Evolution denken , denken , wie ein Gen der eine Zeit der Biologie <unk> .
Es gibt <unk> namens <unk> , die DNS <unk> .
Das <unk> , das in der Zelle existiert hat nicht eines ; das <unk> , das wir <unk> .
Es wurde ausgedrückt und es <unk> das andere <unk> als ausländische Material und <unk> es , und so landeten wir mit einer Zelle mit dem neuen <unk> .
Es ist blau , wegen der Gene , die wir darin <unk> .
Und mit einer sehr kurzen Zeitspanne von einer Spezies , die von einer Spezies verloren und auf die neue Arten umgewandelt wurden , basierend auf der neuen Software , die wir in die Zelle stellten .
All die Proteine haben sich verändert , die <unk> ; wenn wir den genetischen Code lesen , ist es genau das , was wir <unk> haben .
Das klingt vielleicht wie <unk> <unk> , aber wir können , indem wir die Software <unk> , die Dinge ziemlich dramatisch ändern können .
Nun , das ist nicht <unk> ; das ist nicht <unk> ; dies ist auf <unk> Milliarden Jahre der Evolution .
Und ich habe darüber nachgedacht , dass wir vielleicht eine neue Version der <unk> Explosion schaffen , wo es massive neue <unk> gibt , die auf dieses digitale Design basiert .
Warum ?
Ich denke , das ist ziemlich klar , was für eine gewisse Bedürfnisse .
Wir werden von sechs bis zu neun Milliarden Menschen in den nächsten 40 Jahren .
Um mich selbst in den Kontext zu setzen : Ich wurde in 1946 geboren .
Es gibt nun drei Menschen auf dem Planeten für jeden von uns in 1946 ; innerhalb von 40 Jahren gibt es vier .
Wir haben Schwierigkeiten , <unk> und sauberes , <unk> Wasser , Medikamente für 6 und 500 Milliarden .
Es wird einen <unk> um neun zu machen .
Wir nutzen über 5 Milliarden Tonnen Kohle , 30 <unk> Barrel Öl -- das sind hundert Millionen Barrel pro Tag .
Wenn wir uns an biologische Prozesse beschäftigen oder einen Prozess <unk> , dann wird es eine große Herausforderung sein .
Dann gibt es natürlich all das CO2 aus diesem Material , das in der Atmosphäre landet .
Wir haben jetzt , von unserer Entdeckung , auf der Welt , eine Datenbank mit ungefähr 20 Millionen Genen und ich möchte mich gern als <unk> vorstellen .
Die Elektronik funktionierte nur ein Dutzend oder ein <unk> .
Wir sind hier vor allem durch eine biologische Realität und unsere Fantasie .
Wir haben nun Techniken , wegen dieser <unk> <unk> , um zu tun , was wir <unk> <unk> nennen .
Wir haben nun die Möglichkeit , einen großen Roboter zu bauen , der eine Million Chromosomen am Tag bauen kann .
Wenn man bedenkt , diese 20 Millionen verschiedene Gene zu verarbeiten oder zu optimieren , um <unk> zu erzeugen oder Medikamente zu produzieren , können wir nur mit einem kleinen Team , mehr molekulare Biologie tun , als die letzten 20 Jahre Wissenschaft .
Und es ist nur Standard Selektion : wir können für <unk> , <unk> oder <unk> wählen , <unk> , etc.
Das ist ein Bild von einer echten <unk> von wahrer Software , an die wir arbeiten , um in der Computer <unk> und <unk> .
Wissen Sie , wir wissen nicht unbedingt unbedingt wie es aussieht : Wir wissen genau genau , wie ihren genetischen Code aussieht .
Wir konzentrieren uns nun auf <unk> <unk> .
Sie haben vor kurzem auf Ethanol gesehen , Mais zum Beispiel .
Wir haben <unk> und <unk> <unk> <unk> , die relativ schnell in den USA sind , zu viel <unk> Brennstoffe wie <unk> oder verschiedene Arten von <unk> .
Aber die einzige Art , wie wir denken , dass Biologie einen großen Einfluss haben kann , ohne die Kosten des <unk> zu erhöhen und ihre <unk> zu verringern ist , wenn wir mit CO2 als <unk> anfangen , und so arbeiten wir mit dem Aufbau von Zellen .
Und wir denken , wir haben die erste <unk> <unk> in etwa 18 Monaten .
<unk> und CO2 ist eine Methode ...
Aber in unserer Entdeckung haben wir alle möglichen Methoden .
Das ist ein Organismus , den wir 1996 beschrieben haben .
Es lebt im Tiefsee , etwa 1,5 Meter hoch , fast bei <unk> Temperaturen .
Es braucht CO2 für Methan , mittels molekulare Wasserstoff als <unk> .
Wir schauen uns anzusehen , ob wir <unk> CO2 nehmen können , die leicht <unk> werden können , die CO2 in Treibstoff umwandeln kann , um diesen Prozess zu steuern .
Also , in einer kurzen Zeitspanne , denken wir , dass wir in der Lage sein könnten , was die grundlegende Frage des <unk> ist : &quot; Was ist Leben ? &quot;
Wir wissen wirklich , dass wir <unk> Ziele haben , die gesamte <unk> Industrie ersetzen -- Ja . Wenn man das nicht bei TED kann , wo kannst du ?
Aber auch wir arbeiten nun daran , die gleichen Werkzeuge von <unk> <unk> .
Sie haben dieses Jahr mit der Grippe gesehen ; wir sind immer ein Jahr hinter uns und einen Dollar <unk> , wenn es zum richtigen <unk> geht .
Ich denke , das kann man ändern , indem man <unk> Impfstoffe <unk> .
Hier sehen Sie die Zukunft , wie sich die Zukunft vorstellen kann , nun , der evolutionäre Baum , der Evolution mit <unk> Bakterien , <unk> und schließlich <unk> .
Wir sind Wege , die Leute zu verbessern : Unser Ziel ist es , zu wissen , dass wir die Chance haben , lange zu überleben . Vielen Dank .
Was ich Ihnen zuerst zeige , so schnell wie möglich , ist ein wenig <unk> Arbeit , eine neue Technologie , die wir bis zu Microsoft brachten , vor fast ein Jahr .
Das ist <unk> und es ist eine Umgebung , in der man entweder lokal oder <unk> <unk> kann .
Wir sehen uns viele , viele <unk> von digitalen Fotos und <unk> <unk> und <unk> <unk> , die wir wollen .
Und es ist egal , wie viel Informationen wir betrachten , wie groß diese <unk> sind oder wie groß die Bilder sind .
Die meisten von ihnen sind gewöhnliche <unk> <unk> , aber das ist zum Beispiel ein <unk> der Library of Congress , und es befindet sich in 300 <unk> Reichweite .
Es macht keinen Unterschied , denn das Einzige , was die Performance eines Systems <unk> sollte , ist die Anzahl von Pixel auf dem Bildschirm zu <unk> .
Es ist auch sehr flexibel Architektur .
Das ist ein ganzes Buch , ein Beispiel für <unk> Daten .
Das ist &quot; <unk> House &quot; von Dickens . Jede Säule ist ein Kapitel .
Um zu beweisen , dass es wirklich Text ist und nicht ein Bild , wir können so etwas zeigen , um wirklich zu zeigen , dass es ein echtes Bild des Text ist ; es ist kein Bild .
Vielleicht ist es ein künstliches Weg zu lesen .
Ich würde es nicht empfehlen .
Das ist ein <unk> Fall , ein Thema des Guardian .
Jedes große Bild ist der Anfang eines <unk> .
Und es gibt Ihnen wirklich die Freude und die gute Erfahrung , die wahre <unk> einer Zeitschrift oder einer Zeitung zu lesen , eine <unk> Art Medium .
Wir haben etwas mit der Ecke dieses speziellen Problem des Guardian gemacht .
Wir haben eine <unk> Anzeige geschaffen , die sehr viel höher ist als in einer normalen Anzeige – und wir haben zusätzliche Inhalt <unk> .
Wenn man die <unk> dieses Autos sieht , kann man es sehen .
Oder andere Modelle oder technische <unk> .
Und das führt zu einigen dieser Ideen über die Grenzen des <unk> .
Wir hoffen , dass es nicht mehr <unk> und andere solche <unk> gibt .
Natürlich ist es in der Zukunft einer dieser offensichtliche Anwendungen für eine Technologie wie diese .
Und dieser eine , die ich nicht alle Zeit vorbereitet habe , außer zu sagen , dass wir die Dinge haben , die zu diesem Gebiet beitragen .
Aber das sind all die Straßen in den USA .
Auf der Oberfläche eines <unk> .
Also lassen Sie uns jetzt etwas anderes ausdenken .
Das ist tatsächlich im Web live ; man kann es <unk> .
Das ist ein Projekt namens <unk> , der zwei unterschiedliche Technologien <unk> .
Einer von ihnen ist <unk> und das andere ist ein sehr schöner <unk> Forschungen von Noah <unk> , ein Student der University of Washington , <unk> von Steve <unk> bei <unk> .
und Rick <unk> bei Microsoft Research . Eine sehr hübsche Zusammenarbeit .
Und dies ist live im Web . Es wird von <unk> betrieben .
Sie können sehen , dass wenn wir diese Arten näher betrachten , wo wir durch Bilder springen und diese <unk> Erfahrung haben können .
Aber die räumliche Struktur der Bilder ist tatsächlich bedeutsam .
Die <unk> haben diese Bilder <unk> , so dass sie mit dem wirklichen Raum verbunden sind , in dem diese Aufnahmen -- alle <unk> <unk> in den <unk> <unk> – all diese Aufnahmen sind <unk> . Hier sehen Sie Elemente von <unk> <unk> oder <unk> . Diese Dinger haben alle <unk> <unk> .
Ich bin mir nicht sicher , ob ich Zeit habe , irgendeinen anderen Umgebungen zu zeigen .
Manche sind viel mehr <unk> .
Ich möchte gerade direkt zu einer von der ursprünglichen <unk> springen – das ist ein <unk> Prototyp , das wir diesen Sommer <unk> – um Ihnen zu zeigen , was ich denke , der <unk> hinter der <unk> Technologie ist nicht unbedingt so <unk> , dass es nicht unbedingt so <unk> ist , wie wir auf die Plattform gekommen sind .
Wir mussten uns über Anwälte sorgen und so weiter .
Das ist ein <unk> von <unk> Dame , der völlig <unk> von Bildern von Flickr gemacht wurde .
Sie haben nur <unk> Dame auf Flickr , und Sie bekommen einige Bilder von Leuten in <unk> und so weiter .
Und jede dieser typischen <unk> zeigt ein Bild , das zu diesem Modell wurde .
Das sind also alles <unk> und sie haben alle <unk> <unk> .
Wir können einfach auf diese sehr einfache Weise navigeren .
Wissen Sie , ich habe nie gedacht , dass ich bei Microsoft arbeiten würde .
Es ist sehr <unk> . Es ist sehr <unk> .
Sie können sehen , dass es viele verschiedene Arten von Kameras gibt : es ist alles von <unk> <unk> , eine große Zahl von ihnen , <unk> in dieser Umgebung .
Wenn ich einige der seltsamen <unk> finden kann -- so viele von ihnen sind <unk> von Gesichtern und so weiter .
Hier drin ist ein <unk> von Fotos – hier gehen wir .
Das ist ein Poster von <unk> Dame , der richtig richtig eingestellt wird .
Wir können uns vom Poster auf eine physische Sichtweise von dieser Umwelt <unk> .
Der Punkt ist wirklich , dass wir Dinge mit der sozialen Umwelt tun können .
Das ist jetzt <unk> Daten von jedem – vom gesamten kollektiven Gedächtnis , visuell , der Erde – und alle zusammen .
Diese Fotos werden verbunden und sie machen etwas <unk> , das größer ist als die Summe der Teile .
Sie haben ein Modell , das aus der ganzen Erde entsteht .
Stellen Sie sich das lange Schwanz vor , der Virtual Earth <unk> .
Und das ist etwas , das in Komplexität wächst , wie die Leute es nutzen und deren Nutzen immer zu den Nutzer <unk> werden .
Ihre eigenen Fotos werden mit <unk> versehen , die jemand anderes <unk> .
Wenn jemand <unk> <unk> und sagen kann , wer sie sind , dann <unk> mein Foto von <unk> Dame <unk> plötzlich mit all diesen Daten , und ich kann es als <unk> benutzen , in die <unk> , in die man alle möglichen Fotos <unk> und einen <unk> <unk> und einen <unk> <unk> .
Und natürlich ist ein <unk> von all das <unk> <unk> <unk> von jedem interessanten Teil der Erde , nicht nur von <unk> und von <unk> und so weiter , sondern vom kollektiven Gedächtnis .
Vielen Dank .
Chris Anderson : Um es richtig zu verstehen ? Welche Software wird es ermöglichen , in einem gewissen paar Jahren , alle Bilder , die von jedem der Welt geteilt werden , werden miteinander verbunden ?
<unk> : Ja . Was es wirklich macht , ist , zu schaffen , <unk> zu erzeugen , wenn man zwischen Bildern .
Es geht darum , basierend auf dem Inhalt der Bilder .
Und das wird wirklich aufregend sein , wenn man über die Fülle der <unk> nachdenkt , die viele Bilder haben .
Wenn man eine <unk> für Bilder sucht , <unk> man <unk> und der Text auf der Seite ist eine Menge Informationen darüber , was das Bild ist .
Was passiert , wenn dieses Bild links auf Ihren Bildern <unk> ?
Die Menge an <unk> <unk> und Fülle davon ist sehr <unk> .
Es ist ein <unk> <unk> .
CA : <unk> unglaublich . <unk> .
Wissen Sie , eines der <unk> <unk> von Reisen und einer der <unk> von <unk> Forschung ist die Gelegenheit , unter denen zu leben , die nicht die alten Wege vergessen haben , die sich in den Wind <unk> , es in Stein <unk> <unk> und <unk> <unk> .
Nur um zu wissen , dass die <unk> immer weiter weg gehen , oder die Mythen der Inuit , die immer noch bei Bedeutung sind , oder in der Himalayas , dass die <unk> immer noch den Atem des <unk> verfolgen , um sich an der <unk> zu erinnern , es ist die Idee , dass die Welt , in der wir leben , nicht existiert in einem absoluten Sinn , sondern nur ein Modell der Realität ist .
die Konsequenzen einer bestimmten Reihe von <unk> Entscheidungen , die unsere Herkunft gemacht haben , bevor es erfolgreich war , vor vielen Generationen .
Und natürlich teilen wir alle dasselbe <unk> <unk> .
Wir sind alle geboren . Wir alle haben unsere Kinder in die Welt bringen .
Wir gehen durch <unk> <unk> .
Wir müssen mit der <unk> <unk> <unk> umgehen , also sollten wir uns nicht überraschen , dass wir alle tanzen , wir alle haben Kunst .
Aber interessant ist die einzigartige <unk> des Songs , dem Rhythmus des Tanzen in jede Kultur .
Und ob es die <unk> in den Wäldern der <unk> ist , oder die <unk> <unk> in Haiti , oder die <unk> in der <unk> Wüste von <unk> , oder einem <unk> mitten in der Sahara -- das ist übrigens der Typ , der ich in die Wüste <unk> habe – oder ein <unk> <unk> in der <unk> von <unk> .
Everest , die <unk> Mutter der Welt .
All diese Menschen lehren uns , dass es andere Wege gibt , andere Wege zu sein , andere Wege zu finden , sich selbst in der Welt zu <unk> .
Und das ist eine Idee , wenn man darüber nachdenkt , kann man nur mit Hoffnung füllen .
Nun , zusammen sind die <unk> Kulturen der Welt ein <unk> Leben und das kulturelle Leben , das den Planeten <unk> , und ebenso wichtig für das Wohlbefinden des Planeten , wie es tatsächlich die biologischen <unk> des Lebens gibt .
Und Sie denken vielleicht an dieses kulturelle Netz des Lebens zu sein , und Sie könnten vielleicht <unk> sein , und Sie könnten vielleicht die <unk> von allen Gedanken und Träume definieren , Ideen <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Das <unk> ist der große <unk> .
Es ist das Symbol von allem , was wir sind und all das , was wir als erstaunlich <unk> Spezies sein können .
Und nur , wie die Biosphäre schon <unk> ist , ist es auch die <unk> – und , wenn alles , was zu einer viel größere Geschwindigkeit ist .
Kein Biologen würden zum Beispiel zu behaupten , dass 50 Prozent aller Spezies oder bisher am Rand des <unk> oder am Ende des <unk> nicht wahr ist , und dennoch das – das <unk> Szenario im Reich der biologischen Vielfalt – <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Und der große Hinweis darauf ist natürlich <unk> .
Als jeder von Ihnen in diesem Raum geboren wurde , waren es 6.000 Sprachen auf dem Planeten gesprochen .
Eine Sprache ist nicht nur ein Geist des <unk> oder eine Reihe von <unk> Regeln .
Eine Sprache ist ein <unk> des menschlichen Geistes .
Es ist ein Fahrzeug , das die Seele von jeder einzelnen Kultur <unk> .
Jede Sprache ist ein <unk> <unk> des Geistes , ein <unk> , ein Gedanke , ein Ökosystem von spirituellen Möglichkeiten .
Und von diesen 6.000 Sprachen , wie wir heute hier in Monterey sitzen , sind die Hälfte der Hälfte nicht länger in die Ohren <unk> .
Sie werden nicht länger zu Hause gelehrt werden , was es bedeutet , wenn etwas ändert , dann sind sie schon tot <unk> .
Was könnte mehr einsam sein als man in Stille sein kann , um die letzte seiner Menschen zu sprechen , um nicht eine Möglichkeit zu geben , die Weisheit der Vorfahren zu <unk> oder zu erwarten , dass die Kinder der Kinder <unk> ?
Und trotzdem ist es der <unk> Schicksal der Menschen auf der Erde , ungefähr alle zwei Wochen lang auf der Erde , denn alle zwei Wochen später sind ein älterer <unk> einer <unk> <unk> .
Und ich weiß , es gibt einige von Ihnen , die sagen : &quot; Nun , würde es nicht besser sein , nicht die Welt zu sein , wenn wir alle nur eine Sprache haben ? &quot; Und ich sage : &quot; Großartig , lass uns das <unk> . &quot; Und ich sage : &quot; Großartig , lass es uns <unk> . &quot;
Machen wir es <unk> . &quot;
Und Sie werden plötzlich herausfinden , wie es sein würde , nicht in Ihrer eigenen Sprache zu sprechen .
Und was ich heute mit Ihnen tun möchte , ist , wie ich Ihnen heute mit Ihnen gehen will , in eine Reise durch die <unk> , eine kurze Reise durch die <unk> .
Es gibt viele von uns , die es vergessen , wenn ich sage &quot; unterschiedliche Wege &quot; zu sein .
Nehmen Sie zum Beispiel dieses Kind eines <unk> im <unk> Amazonas , der daran glaubt , dass <unk> die <unk> aus dem Osten in der buik von heiligen Schlangen <unk> .
Nun , dies ist ein Menschen , der nicht die blauen von Grün unterscheiden kann , denn die Baumkronen des <unk> ist der <unk> des <unk> , der die Menschen <unk> .
Sie haben eine <unk> Sprache und <unk> <unk> genannt : Sie müssen jemanden heiraten , der eine andere Sprache spricht .
Und das ist alles <unk> in der <unk> Vergangenheit , aber die <unk> Sache ist in diesen langen Häusern , wo es sechs oder sieben Sprachen gibt , wegen der <unk> , man hört niemand eine Sprache zu üben .
Sie hören einfach und beginnen zu reden .
Oder einer der am meisten <unk> Stämme , die ich je gelebt habe , die <unk> von <unk> in 1958 , ein <unk> Menschen <unk> in 1958 .
In 1957 versuchten fünf <unk> und <unk> einen kritischen Fehler .
Sie fallen von der Luft 8 x 10 <unk> Fotos von selbst in den <unk> , die wir sagen würden , dass diese Menschen des <unk> nie etwas <unk> in ihrem Leben gesehen haben .
Sie haben diese Fotos vom <unk> <unk> und versuchten , sich hinter dem Gesicht anzuschauen , um die Form oder die Figur zu finden und zu <unk> , und zu <unk> , dass sie den <unk> von dem Teufel <unk> .
Aber die <unk> waren nicht nur <unk> <unk> .
Sie <unk> einander .
54 Prozent ihrer Sterblichkeit <unk> sie .
Wir <unk> acht Generationen zurück , und wir fanden zwei Fälle von natürlichen Tod und als wir die Leute ein wenig dagegen <unk> , gaben sie , dass einer der <unk> so alt war , dass er alt war , so dass wir ihn trotzdem <unk> . Aber zur gleichen Zeit hatten sie ein <unk> Wissen des <unk> , das erstaunlich war .
Ihre <unk> könnten <unk> in 40 <unk> riechen und sagen , welche Spezies es zurückgelassen hat .
In den frühen 80er Jahren hatte ich eine sehr erstaunliche Aufgabe , als ich von meinem Professor in Harvard gefragt wurde , ob ich mich interessierte , in Haiti zu gehen und die geheimen <unk> , die die Basis von <unk> und <unk> <unk> , und das Gift um <unk> zu machen .
Um ein Gefühl des <unk> zu schaffen , muss ich natürlich etwas über dieses bemerkenswerte Gefühl von <unk> verstehen . Und <unk> ist kein <unk> .
Im Gegenteil ist es eine komplizierte <unk> <unk> .
Es ist interessant .
Wenn ich Sie gebeten habe , die große Religionen der Welt zu benennen , was würden Sie sagen ?
Der Islam , der Islam , <unk> , was auch immer .
Es gibt immer noch einen Kontinent , der in der Annahme liegt , dass <unk> nicht religiöse Überzeugungen haben . Nun , natürlich , sie und <unk> ist einfach die <unk> von diesen sehr <unk> religiösen Ideen , die während der tragische Diaspora der Sklaverei <unk> .
Aber , was daraus interessant ist , ist , dass es eine lebende Beziehung zwischen dem lebenden und dem Toten ist .
Also , die lebende <unk> <unk> .
Die Geister können von dem &quot; Great See &quot; <unk> werden , auf dem sie auf dem Rhythmus des Lebens reagiert haben , um die Seele des Lebens zu <unk> , so dass für diese kurzen <unk> der <unk> die Gott wird .
Deshalb sagen die <unk> , wie man sagen kann , dass &quot; <unk> Menschen zur Kirche gehen und über Gott spricht . &quot;
Wir tanzen im Tempel und werden Gott werden . &quot;
Und da Sie <unk> sind , sind Sie von dem Geist <unk> – wie können Sie verletzt werden ?
Sie sehen also diese erstaunliche <unk> : <unk> <unk> in einem <unk> <unk> , der <unk> mit <unk> , eine eher erstaunliche Demonstration der Fähigkeit , den Körper zu beeinflussen , die es als <unk> im <unk> <unk> .
Nun , von all den Völker , die ich je getroffen habe , sind die <unk> des <unk> des Sierra Nevada , der Santa <unk> im Norden <unk> .
<unk> der alten <unk> Zivilisation , die einmal die <unk> Küste von Columbia <unk> , in der <unk> <unk> , in ein <unk> <unk> <unk> , der über der <unk> Küste <unk> .
In einem <unk> Kontinent wurden diese Menschen alleine nicht <unk> .
Bis zu diesem Tag bleiben sie von einem <unk> <unk> , aber der Training für die <unk> ist ziemlich außergewöhnlich .
Die jungen <unk> werden von ihren Familien <unk> von drei und vier , <unk> in einer <unk> Welt der Dunkelheit in Stein <unk> , um 18 Jahre lang zu <unk> : zwei <unk> <unk> <unk> , die in ihrer natürlichen <unk> <unk> ; jetzt sind sie <unk> in der <unk> der große Mutter .
Und für diese ganze Zeit <unk> sie sich in die Werte ihrer Gesellschaft , die Werte , die den <unk> aufrechterhalten , dass ihre Gebete und Gebete nur den <unk> halten -- oder wir könnten sagen , die <unk> -- Gleichgewicht .
Und am Ende dieses unglaublichen <unk> , eines Tages werden sie plötzlich <unk> und zum ersten Mal in ihrem Leben <unk> , und in diesem <unk> Moment des Bewusstseins sehen Sie ein <unk> . Und in dem Moment des <unk> , der sie in der <unk> wunderschöne <unk> <unk> , <unk> plötzlich alles , was sie gelernt haben , <unk> in <unk> <unk> . Und der <unk> Schritt zurück in <unk> .
und sagt : &quot; Seht ihr ? Es ist wirklich so , wie ich es dir erzählt habe .
Es ist wunderschön . Es ist Ihre zu schützen . &quot;
Sie nennen sich die &quot; älteren Brüder &quot; und sie sagen , wer die jüngeren Brüder sind , sind diejenigen verantwortlich für die Zerstörung der Welt .
Diese Intuition ist sehr wichtig .
Wann immer wir an <unk> Menschen und Landschaften denken , <unk> wir entweder <unk> und das alte <unk> des &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , eine Idee <unk> <unk> und <unk> <unk> und sagen , dass diese Menschen näher der Erde sind als wir .
Nun , <unk> Menschen sind weder <unk> noch <unk> von <unk> .
Es gibt nicht viel Platz für die <unk> <unk> des <unk> oder in den <unk> <unk> von Tibet , aber sie haben , trotzdem , durch Zeit und <unk> <unk> eine traditionelle <unk> der Erde , die nicht über die Idee gekommen sind , sondern über eine weit <unk> Intuition zu <unk> : Die Idee , dass die Erde selbst existieren kann , denn es ist in der Nähe des menschlichen Bewusstseins .
Nun , was bedeutet das ?
Das bedeutet , dass ein junges Kind aus den <unk> , die zu glauben , dass der Berg ein <unk> Geist ist , der sein Schicksal oder ihr Schicksal <unk> werden kann , und eine andere Beziehung zu dieser Quelle von Montana oder an dieser Stelle als ein junges Kind aus Montana <unk> , um zu glauben , dass ein Berg ein Haufen von Stein ist .
Ob es die <unk> eines Geist oder einen Haufen <unk> ist .
Interessant ist die Metapher die die Beziehung zwischen Mensch und Natur <unk> .
Ich wurde in den Wäldern der britischen Columbia erzogen , um zu glauben , dass die Wälder <unk> .
Das machte mich ein anderes Mensch als meine Freunde unter der <unk> , die glauben , dass diese Wälder die <unk> von <unk> und <unk> <unk> <unk> und die <unk> Geister <unk> , die am Ende der Welt <unk> .
Nun , wenn Sie anfangen , die Idee zu betrachten , dass diese Kulturen unterschiedliche Realitäten erschaffen können , dann können Sie anfangen , einige ihrer außergewöhnlichen Entdeckungen zu verstehen . Sehen Sie diese Pflanze hier .
Es ist ein Foto , das ich im <unk> Amazonas machte .
Das ist <unk> , viele von Ihnen haben gehört , wie viele von Ihnen gehört haben , die <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Was <unk> faszinierend ist nicht das <unk> <unk> Potenzial dieser Vorbereitung , sondern die <unk> . Es besteht wirklich von zwei verschiedenen Quellen : auf der einen Seite von <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> – um die <unk> in der <unk> zu nehmen – aber es hat sich <unk> mit den Blätter eines <unk> in der <unk> von einer <unk> in der <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Diese Pflanze hatte ein paar sehr starke <unk> , sehr nahe an der <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Wenn Sie jemals die <unk> gesehen haben , die ihre Nase <unk> , die sie von einer anderen Reihe von Spezies haben , die auch <unk> sind .
Um diese <unk> <unk> zu haben , ist es eher so , wie man aus einem <unk> gefilmt wird , mit <unk> Gemälde und landing auf einem See . Es erzeugt nicht die <unk> der Wirklichkeit ; es erzeugt die <unk> von Wirklichkeit .
Tatsächlich sprach ich mit meinem Professor , Richard Evan <unk> -- der Mann , der die <unk> Ära der <unk> <unk> in Mexiko in den <unk> Jahren <unk> – ich behaupte , dass man diese <unk> nicht so <unk> <unk> kann , denn wenn man bei der Effekte ist , gibt es nicht mehr ein <unk> , um eine <unk> zu erleben . Aber es ist bei <unk> nicht <unk> werden können .
Sie werden von einem <unk> <unk> , der von Natur im menschlichen <unk> <unk> .
Sie können nur <unk> werden , wenn sie in <unk> mit anderen chemischen <unk> <unk> .
Nun , die faszinierende Dinge sind , dass die <unk> innerhalb der <unk> <unk> <unk> sind , um die <unk> <unk> zu <unk> . Sie fragen sich also eine Frage .
Wie , in einem <unk> von 80.000 Arten von <unk> Pflanzen , finden diese Leute diese beiden <unk> nicht , die , wenn sie auf diese Weise <unk> , eine Art <unk> Version des Ganzen haben , als der Summe der Teile ?
Nun , wir nutzen diese große <unk> , &quot; Versuch und Fehler &quot; , die nicht <unk> sind .
Aber Sie fragen die Inder und sagen : &quot; Die Pflanzen reden mit uns . &quot;
Nun , was bedeutet das ?
Dieser Stamm , der <unk> , hat 17 Arten von <unk> , alle davon , wie sie eine große Distanz in dem Wald unterscheiden , all das , was sie als Spezies <unk> .
Und dann fragen Sie , wie sie ihre <unk> <unk> und sagen : &quot; Ich dachte , man wusste etwas über Pflanzen .
Ich meine , wissen Sie , wissen Sie nicht ? &quot; Und ich sagte : &quot; Nein . &quot;
Nun , es stellt sich heraus , dass man jede von der 17 Arten in der Nacht eines <unk> <unk> und es auf einen anderen <unk> <unk> .
Nun , das wird nicht einen Doktor in Harvard geben , aber es ist viel interessanter als <unk> . Jetzt – – das Problem – das Problem ist , dass selbst die von uns <unk> <unk> <unk> Menschen <unk> und <unk> haben , aber auf die <unk> der Geschichte der Geschichte , der unsere Welt <unk> , sich <unk> .
Nun , die Wahrheit ist im 20. Jahrhundert , 300 Jahre lang , nicht an seine Kriege oder die technologischen Innovationen , sondern eher als die Zeit , in der wir die enorme Zerstörung der biologischen und kulturellen Vielfalt auf dem Planeten <unk> . Nun , das Problem ist nicht ändern .
Alle Kulturen über die ganze Zeit haben sich ständig mit neuen Möglichkeiten beschäftigt .
Und das Problem ist nicht die Technologie selbst .
Die Sioux haben nicht aufgehört zu dienen , als sie den Bogen <unk> und mehr als ein Amerikaner mehr als ein Amerikaner hörten , als er das Pferd <unk> und <unk> .
Es ist nicht die Veränderung oder Technologie die die Integrität des <unk> <unk> . Es ist Macht , die <unk> <unk> .
<unk> Sie sich auf die Welt , Sie entdecken , dass es nicht <unk> sind , zu verschwinden ; es sind dynamische Menschen , die von der Existenz von <unk> Kräften abhängen , die sich <unk> , ob es die <unk> <unk> in der <unk> des <unk> ist – eine <unk> Menschen aus <unk> – von <unk> – ein Volk , der im Wald <unk> , bis vor einer Generation .
Und nun wurden alle zu <unk> und <unk> auf den <unk> der Flüsse reduziert , wo man sehen kann , dass der Fluss selbst mit der Hälfte von <unk> bis zum Süden gelangt , wo die Japaner am Horizont liegen , wo die Japaner am Horizont liegen , oder in dem Fall des <unk> .
Es ist die <unk> , die in der <unk> von Gold gekommen sind .
Oder wenn wir in die Berge von Tibet reisen , wo ich vor kurzem viel Forschung mache , dann sehen Sie ein <unk> Gesicht der politischen <unk> .
Wissen Sie , Völkermord , der physischen Aussterben von Menschen ist <unk> , aber <unk> , die Zerstörung der Menschen des Lebens , ist nicht nur nicht nicht <unk> ; es ist allgemein , in vielen Ecken , als Teil einer <unk> .
Und man kann den Schmerz von Tibet nicht verstehen , bis man es auf dem Boden bewegt .
Ich habe mich mal 17 Meilen von <unk> Meilen von <unk> in West China <unk> , um von einem jungen Kollegen zu <unk> , und es war nur als ich <unk> habe , dass ich das Gesicht hinter den Statistiken des <unk> <unk> habe : 6000 heilige <unk> <unk> bis zu Staub und <unk> , 1,2 Millionen Menschen , die von der <unk> des <unk> getötet wurden .
Dieser junger Vater war der Vater des <unk> .
Das bedeutete , dass er sofort zu der Zeit der chinesischen Invasion getötet wurde .
Sein Onkel <unk> mit seinen <unk> in der Diaspora , die die Menschen nach Nepal brachten .
Seine Mutter war eingesperrt für <unk> .
Er wurde im Gefängnis im Gefängnis <unk> , um unter ihren <unk> zu verstecken , denn sie konnte nicht ertragen .
Die Schwester , die das mutig gemacht hatte , wurde in ein <unk> gebracht .
Eines Tages <unk> sie einen <unk> von Mao und für diese <unk> wurde sie sieben Jahre lang <unk> .
Der Schmerz von Tibet kann unmöglich sein , aber der <unk> Geist der Menschen ist etwas Besonderes .
Und am Ende geht es um eine Entscheidung : Wollen wir in einer <unk> Welt von <unk> leben oder wollen wir eine <unk> Welt der Vielfalt <unk> ?
Margaret <unk> , der große <unk> , sagte , bevor sie starb , dass ihre größte Angst , dass wir auf diese <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> nicht nur die gesamte Reichweite der menschlichen Vorstellungskraft haben , sondern dass wir von einem Traum eines Tages aufwachen könnten , es gab noch andere Möglichkeiten , es gab noch andere Möglichkeiten .
Und es ist <unk> , zu erinnern , dass unsere Spezies , vielleicht schon seit 150.000 Jahren .
Die <unk> Revolution – die uns die Landwirtschaft <unk> , in der wir die <unk> des <unk> <unk> ; die Poesie des <unk> wurde von der <unk> des <unk> <unk> . Wir haben Hierarchie <unk> , ist erst vor 10.000 Jahren .
Die moderne industrielle Welt , wie wir wissen , ist kaum 300 Jahre alt .
Diese <unk> Geschichte zeigt mich nicht , dass wir alle Antworten für alle Herausforderungen haben , die uns in den kommenden <unk> <unk> werden müssen .
Wenn diese <unk> Kultur der Welt der Welt <unk> werden , dann reagieren sie mit 10.000 verschiedenen Stimmen .
Und es ist in diesem Lied möglich , dass wir alle die Möglichkeiten entdecken können , was wir sind : eine voll bewusst Spezies , die uns alle Völker und alle <unk> finden können . Und es gibt große Momente des <unk> . Und es gibt große Momente des Optimismus .
Das ist ein Foto , ich nahm an die Norden von <unk> Island , als ich mich <unk> mit einigen Inuit <unk> und dieser Mann , <unk> , erzählte mir eine wunderbare Geschichte von seinem Großvater .
Die <unk> Regierung war nicht immer der Weg zu den <unk> . In den <unk> zu <unk> , mussten wir sie in <unk> <unk> .
Dieser alte Mann ist der Großvater <unk> .
Die Familie , Angst für sein Leben , <unk> all seine Waffen .
Sie müssen verstehen , dass die Inuit nicht Angst haben ; sie haben es <unk> .
Die <unk> ihrer <unk> wurden ursprünglich von Fischen <unk> .
Dieser Mann wurde nicht von der <unk> von der Arktis <unk> oder der <unk> <unk> .
Er <unk> einfach draußen und zog seine <unk> <unk> und <unk> in seine Hand . Und während der <unk> <unk> er ihn in die Form eines <unk> .
Er setzte einen <unk> am Rand des <unk> und während der letzten Zeit <unk> er einen Hund .
Er <unk> den Hund und <unk> einen <unk> und nahm einen <unk> von dem Hund <unk> und <unk> einen <unk> Hund und verschwand über die <unk> <unk> und verschwand über die <unk> .
Reden Sie darüber nach nichts zu bekommen . Und das , in vielerlei Hinsicht , ist ein Symbol der <unk> der <unk> der <unk> und aller <unk> Menschen auf der ganzen Welt .
Der <unk> Regierung im April 1999 gab es auf der absoluten Kontrolle von den Inuit ein Gebiet von Land , der mehr als Kalifornien <unk> .
Es ist unsere neue <unk> . Es heißt <unk> .
Es ist ein <unk> Gebiet . Sie kontrollieren alle <unk> Ressourcen .
Ein <unk> Beispiel dafür , wie ein <unk> mit seinen Leuten <unk> kann .
Und am Ende , am Ende , denke ich , es ist ziemlich offensichtlich , zumindest alle von uns alle , die in diesen abgelegenen <unk> <unk> , zu erkennen , dass sie überhaupt nicht <unk> sind .
Sie sind <unk> von jemandem .
Sie repräsentieren die <unk> der menschlichen Vorstellungskraft , die bis zum <unk> <unk> . Und für uns alle , die Träume dieser Kinder , wie die Träume unserer eigenen Kinder , werden Teil der <unk> <unk> der Hoffnung .
Was wir also versuchen , bei der National Geographic zu tun ist , wir glauben , dass Politiker nie etwas erreichen werden .
Wir denken , das <unk> – – wir denken , dass <unk> nicht <unk> sind , aber wir denken , dass die Geschichten die Welt verändern können , und so sind wir wahrscheinlich die beste <unk> Organisation der Welt . Wir bekommen jeden Monat 35 Millionen auf unserer Website .
<unk> Nationen tragen unser <unk> .
Unsere Zeitschriften lesen Millionen .
Und was wir tun , ist eine Reihe von Reisen zu <unk> , wo wir unser Publikum auf Orte von solch kulturellen Fragen nehmen , dass sie nicht helfen können , aber hoffentlich <unk> sie sich , und hoffentlich ist es allmählich <unk> , eine neue <unk> der <unk> zu <unk> : dass diese Welt auf einer <unk> Weise existieren kann , dass wir einen Weg finden können , in einer <unk> und <unk> Welt zu leben .
wo alle Weisheit aller Völker zu unserem gemeinsamen Wohlbefinden beitragen können .
Vielen Dank .
Ich werde über einige Dinge sprechen , die in diesem Buch gehört werden , dass ich hoffentlich mit anderen Dingen <unk> , und ich werde versuchen , einige Verbindungen zu schaffen , falls ich sie <unk> .
Aber ich will beginnen mit dem , was ich &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; nenne .
Die <unk> <unk> ?
Der <unk> <unk> aller westlichen industriellen Gesellschaften .
Und der <unk> <unk> läuft so : Wenn wir uns interessieren wollen , wie wir uns interessieren wollen , ist es die Art zu <unk> <unk> .
Der Grund dafür ist , dass die Freiheit von Freiheit und von selbst gut wertvoll ist , <unk> für Menschen .
Und wenn Menschen Freiheit haben , dann kann jeder von uns handeln , um die Dinge zu tun , die unser Wohlergehen <unk> , und niemand muss uns entscheiden .
Um Freiheit zu <unk> ist es die Entscheidung zu <unk> .
Je mehr Auswahlmöglichkeiten haben , desto mehr Freiheit sie haben und je mehr Freiheit haben , desto mehr <unk> sie .
Das , denke ich , ist so tief in der <unk> <unk> , die es nicht <unk> würde .
Und es ist auch tief verankert in unserem Leben .
Ich werde Ihnen einige Beispiele zeigen , was moderne Fortschritt für uns ermöglicht .
Das ist mein Supermarkt . Nicht so groß .
Ich will nur ein Wort über <unk> sagen .
Mit einem <unk> in meinem Supermarkt , wenn man nicht die 10 <unk> <unk> und 12 <unk> <unk> kann , kann man es kaufen , um eine sehr große Anzahl an eurer eigenen <unk> zu machen , in die <unk> , die nicht von dem <unk> <unk> .
Das ist die <unk> .
Und dann gehen Sie ins <unk> , um ein <unk> zu bauen – Sprecher , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> – und in diesem einzigen <unk> gibt es so viele <unk> .
Wir können <unk> verschiedene <unk> aus den Komponenten bauen , die in einem Laden in einem Laden stehen .
Sie müssen zugeben , das ist viel <unk> .
In anderen Bereichen – die Welt der Kommunikation .
Es gab eine Zeit , als ich ein Junge war , wenn man ein <unk> <unk> konnte , solange es von Mama Bell kam .
Sie <unk> Ihr Telefon . Sie kauften es nicht .
Eine Konsequenz davon ist übrigens , dass das Telefon nie zerstört wurde .
Und die Tage sind weg .
Wir haben jetzt eine fast <unk> Menge von Telefone , vor allem in der Welt von Handys .
Das sind Handys der Zukunft .
Mein Liebling ist der mittlere – der <unk> , der <unk> und <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Und wenn man vielleicht das nicht in deinem Laden gesehen hat , kann man auch einen <unk> <unk> .
Und das führt dazu , dass es Menschen dazu bringt , in ihre Läden zu gehen .
Und wissen Sie , was die Antwort auf diese Frage ist ?
Die Antwort ist &quot; Nein &quot; .
Es ist nicht möglich ein Handy zu kaufen , der nicht zu viel tut .
In anderen Bereichen des Lebens , die viel wichtiger sind als es zu kaufen ist , der gleiche <unk> der Entscheidung ist wahr .
Gesundheitsversorgung . Es ist nicht länger der Fall in den USA , die man zum Arzt gehen will , und der Arzt sagt , was man zu tun hat .
Stattdessen gehen Sie zum Arzt und der Arzt sagt , &quot; Nun , wir könnten A oder wir wählen .
Eine hat diese Vorteile und diese Risiken .
B hat diese Vorteile und diese Risiken . Was wollen Sie tun ? &quot;
Und Sie sagen : &quot; Doktor , was soll ich tun ? &quot;
Und der <unk> sagt : &quot; Einer hat diese Vorteile und <unk> . Und B hat diese Vorteile und <unk> .
Was wollen Sie tun ? &quot;
Und Sie sagen : &quot; Wenn du mich warst , Doktor , was würdest du tun ? &quot;
Und die <unk> sagt : &quot; Aber ich bin nicht . &quot;
Und das Ergebnis ist -- wir nennen es &quot; Patient &quot; , das es wie eine gute Sache klingt , aber es ist wirklich ein <unk> der Last und der Verantwortung für Entscheidungen von jemandem , der etwas kennt -- nämlich der Arzt -- zu jemandem , der nichts kennt , und nicht in der beste Form , um Entscheidungen zu treffen -- nämlich der Patient .
Es gibt ein riesiges Marketing für <unk> Medikamente für Menschen wie Sie und ich , die , wenn Sie darüber nachdenken , nicht <unk> .
Warum können sie uns auf uns nicht kaufen ?
Die Antwort ist , dass sie erwarten , unsere Ärzte am nächsten Morgen zu nennen und unsere <unk> zu bitten .
Etwas so dramatisch , wie unsere Identität nun eine Frage der Wahl ist .
Wir haben keine Identität <unk> ; wir können es erfinden .
Und wir werden uns so oft <unk> .
Und das bedeutet , jeden Tag , wenn man morgens aufwachen muss , musst du entscheiden , welche Person du willst .
Mit der Ehe zu Ehe und Familie gab es eine Zeit , in der die <unk> fast alle haben , dass man so schnell geheiratet hat , und dann haben Sie Kinder so schnell wie möglich .
Die einzig echte Entscheidung war der , nicht wann , und nicht , was Sie später getan haben .
Heutzutage ist alles viel hoch .
Ich <unk> wunderbar intelligente Studenten und ich <unk> 20 Prozent weniger Arbeit als zuvor .
Und es ist nicht so , weil sie weniger schlau sind und es nicht weil sie weniger <unk> sind .
Es liegt daran , dass sie beschäftigt sind und fragen : &quot; Sollte ich heiraten oder nicht ? Sollte ich jetzt heiraten ? &quot;
Sollte ich später heiraten ? Sollte ich Kinder zuerst haben ? &quot;
All das sind Fragen .
Und sie werden diese Fragen beantworten , egal ob es nicht die Arbeit ist , die ich <unk> und keine gute Klasse in meine Kurse bekommen kann .
Und tatsächlich sollten sie . Das sind wichtige Fragen .
Werk – wir sind <unk> , wie Carl <unk> <unk> , mit der Technologie , die uns jede Minute jeden Tag von jedem Tag auf dem Planeten helfen kann – außer dem Randolph .
Es gibt übrigens eine Ecke , die ich nicht erzählen werde .
Ich erzähle Ihnen nicht darüber , denn ich will es benutzen .
Was dies bedeutet , diese unglaubliche Freiheit der Wahl , die wir mit Respekt zu tun haben , ist , dass wir eine Entscheidung treffen müssen , immer und immer wieder , ob wir nicht arbeiten sollten .
Wir können sehen , wie unser Kind Fußball spielt , und wir haben unser Handy auf eine Hüfte und unser Blackberry über unsere andere Hüfte , und unser Laptop , wahrscheinlich auf unsere <unk> .
Und selbst wenn sie alle <unk> sind , alle Minuten , wenn wir unser Kind <unk> , dann fragen wir uns auch : &quot; Sollte ich diesen Anruf <unk> ?
Sollte ich auf diese E-Mail reagieren ? Sollte ich diesen Brief <unk> ? &quot;
Und selbst wenn die Antwort auf die Frage lautet : &quot; Nein &quot; , es wird sicherlich die Erfahrung des Kindes <unk> als es wäre .
Überall wo wir schauen , große Dinge und kleine Dinge und <unk> Dinge und Dinge zu leben , ist Leben eine Frage der Wahl .
Und die Welt , die wir gewohnt haben , sind so <unk> .
Es ist zu sagen , es gab einige Entscheidungen , aber nicht alles war eine Frage der Wahl .
Und die Welt , die wir heute sehen , sind so .
Und die Frage ist : Ist das gute Nachrichten oder schlechte Nachrichten ?
Und die Antwort ist : &quot; Ja . &quot;
Wir wissen alle darüber , was gut darüber ist , also werde ich darüber sprechen , was schlecht darüber ist .
All diese Wahl hat zwei Auswirkungen auf die Leute .
Ein Effekt , der <unk> ist , ist , dass es Lähmung erzeugt , anstatt die Befreiung .
Mit so vielen Optionen entscheiden sich die Leute es sehr schwierig zu wählen .
Ich werde Ihnen ein sehr <unk> Beispiel dafür geben : Eine Studie , die von Investitionen betrieben wurde .
Einer meiner Kollegen bekam Zugang zu <unk> von <unk> , der <unk> <unk> Firma von ungefähr einer Million Angestellte und etwa 2000 verschiedene <unk> .
Und sie fand heraus , dass für alle 10 <unk> Spenden die <unk> angeboten wurden , die <unk> <unk> .
Sie bieten 50 Mittel -- 10 Prozent weniger Angestellte als wenn Sie nur 5 Prozent anbieten . Warum ?
Denn bei 50 Dollar um zu wählen ist es so verdammt schwierig zu entscheiden , welches <unk> zu wählen ist , dass man es bis zu morgen <unk> .
Und morgen morgen und morgen , und morgen kommt morgen nie .
Verstehen Sie nicht nur das bedeutet , dass die Leute essen müssen müssen , wenn sie in Rente gehen müssen , denn sie haben nicht genug Geld <unk> , es bedeutet auch , dass es die Entscheidung bringt , die Entscheidung zu treffen , dass sie <unk> <unk> Geld vom <unk> <unk> .
Wenn man nicht <unk> ist , werden sie bis zu 5.000 Dollar pro Jahr auf dem <unk> <unk> , der glücklich war .
<unk> ist also eine Folge von zu vielen Entscheidungen .
Und ich denke , es macht die Welt so . Und zum Schluss , für alle Ewigkeit , Französisch , <unk> , oder <unk> ? Man will wirklich die Entscheidung treffen , ob es für alle Ewigkeit ist .
Sie wollen nicht das falsche <unk> finanzieren , oder die falsche <unk> .
Das zweite ist ein Effekt . Der zweite Effekt ist , dass selbst wenn wir die Lähmung überwinden und eine Wahl treffen , die wir nicht mehr zufrieden haben mit dem Ergebnis der Wahl , als wir es wären , wenn wir weniger Optionen hätten .
Und es gibt einige Gründe dafür .
mit viel unterschiedlichen <unk> zu tun . Wenn man eines kaufen kann , und es ist nicht perfekt -- und was <unk> ist ? Es ist leicht , sich vorzustellen , dass man eine andere Wahl haben könnte . Und was passiert ist , dass es eine <unk> Alternative <unk> <unk> , die man <unk> , und dieses Bedauern <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
selbst wenn es eine gute Entscheidung war .
Je mehr Optionen es gibt , desto einfacher ist es , etwas zu Bedauern zu <unk> .
Zweitens , was Ökonomen <unk> .
Dan Gilbert Gilbert ein großer Punkt darüber zu sprechen , wie viel die Art , wie wir Dinge wertschätzen , von dem wir sie vergleichen .
Nun , wenn es viele Alternativen gibt , um zu denken , es ist leicht , die <unk> <unk> von Alternativen zu finden , die Sie <unk> , die Sie weniger zufrieden haben mit der Alternative , die Sie ausgewählt haben .
Hier ist ein Beispiel . Ich kann nicht aufhören über die anderen <unk> <unk> auf der <unk> Straße .
Hier sollten Sie nachdenken .
Hier ist ein paar auf der <unk> .
Sehr teuer .
Ein <unk> . <unk> Tag . Sie haben alles zu sich selbst .
Was könnte besser sein ?
&quot; Es ist verdammt , &quot; dieser Typ denkt : &quot; Es ist August . Jeder in meiner <unk> Nachbarschaft ist weg .
Ich könnte direkt vor meinem Gebäude stehen . &quot;
Und er gibt zwei Wochen <unk> , von der Idee , dass er die Gelegenheit fehlt , am Tag eines Tages einen großen Parkplatz zu haben .
<unk> von der Zufriedenheit , die wir uns entscheiden , was wir wählen , selbst wenn wir uns <unk> .
Und je mehr Optionen es zu beachten gibt , desto mehr <unk> Eigenschaften dieser Optionen werden von uns <unk> .
Hier ist ein anderes Beispiel .
Dieser Cartoon zeigt viele Punkte .
Es dreht sich auch darum , im Moment zu leben und wahrscheinlich zu tun .
Aber ein Punkt ist es , wenn man eine Sache wählen kann , dann entscheiden Sie nicht , andere Dinge zu tun , die viele <unk> Eigenschaften haben , und es wird zu tun , was man macht .
Drittens : <unk> der Erwartungen .
Das traf mich als ich meine <unk> <unk> .
Ich trage <unk> <unk> .
Es gab eine Zeit in der Zeit , in der <unk> <unk> und man sie <unk> und <unk> wie Mist , sie waren unglaublich unangenehm , wenn man sie trug und <unk> <unk> , und sie <unk> <unk> .
Ich <unk> meine <unk> nach , um die alten zu <unk> und ich sagte : &quot; Ich will ein Paar <unk> . Hier ist meine Größe . &quot;
Und der <unk> sagte : &quot; Möchten Sie <unk> passen , <unk> passen ?
Sie wollen <unk> oder <unk> fliegen ? Wollen Sie <unk> oder <unk> ?
Wollen Sie sie <unk> ?
Sie wollen <unk> , <unk> , bla bla . &quot; Auf und weiter ging es .
Mein <unk> fiel herunter . Und nachdem ich <unk> , sagte ich : &quot; Ich will die Art , wie es früher war . &quot;
Er hatte keine Ahnung , was das war , also habe ich mir eine Stunde lang <unk> , und ich ging raus in den Laden -- Wahrheit !
Ich hab besser gemacht . All diese Wahl kann ich besser machen .
Aber – ich fühlte mich schlimmer .
Warum ? Ich habe ein ganzes Buch geschrieben , um es mir zu erklären .
Der Grund , warum ich schlimmer war , ist , dass ich mit all diesen Optionen <unk> , wie gut ein Paar <unk> <unk> sollte .
Ich hatte sehr niedrige und nicht bestimmte Erwartungen als sie nur in einen Geschmack kam .
Als sie 100 Jahre nach 100 <unk> kamen , sollte einer von ihnen perfekt sein .
Und was ich gut war , aber es war nicht perfekt .
Also fragte ich mich , was ich fragte , was ich erwartet hatte , und was ich im Vergleich zu dem , was ich erwartete .
<unk> für die Leben der Leute können nicht helfen , aber die Erwartungen die Menschen haben , wie gut diese Optionen sein werden .
Und was das führt , ist weniger Zufriedenheit bei Ergebnissen , selbst wenn sie gute Ergebnisse sind .
Niemand in der Welt weiß es .
Und es sieht alle so toll aus . Ich kann nicht <unk> warten .
Die Wahrheit ist eher so .
Und alles war besser , als alles schlimmer war , der Grund war , dass alles besser war , als alles schlimmer war , dass es möglich war , dass es möglich war , Erfahrungen zu erleben , die ein <unk> überrascht waren .
Heutzutage , die Welt , in der wir leben -- wir <unk> , <unk> Bürger und <unk> die <unk> , die es jemals möglich sein kann , ist , dass das Zeug genauso gut ist wie Sie es erwarten .
Sie werden nie überrascht werden zu werden , denn Ihre Erwartungen , meine Erwartungen , sind durch das Dach .
Das Geheimnis des Glücks – das ist es , was Sie alle <unk> – das Geheimnis des Glücks sind niedrige Erwartungen .
Ich will sagen – nur ein kleines <unk> Moment – ich bin verheiratet zu einer Frau und sie ist ganz schön schön .
Ich konnte nicht besser sein . Ich habe mich nicht <unk> .
Aber <unk> ist nicht immer so schlecht .
Zum Schluss – eine Folge davon , ein <unk> Paar <unk> zu kaufen , wenn es nur eine einzige Möglichkeit gibt , zu kaufen , und fragt warum , wer verantwortlich ist , ist die Welt .
Was könnten Sie tun ?
Wenn es hunderte verschiedene <unk> gibt , und Sie kaufen eine <unk> und fragen Sie warum , wer verantwortlich ist ?
Es ist ebenso klar , dass die Antwort auf die Frage lautet : &quot; Du . &quot;
Sie hätten besser gemacht können .
Mit hundert Arten von <unk> auf dem Bildschirm gibt es kein <unk> für <unk> .
Und wenn Menschen Entscheidungen treffen und auch wenn die Ergebnisse der Entscheidungen gut sind , sind sie <unk> über sie <unk> ; sie stimmen zu .
<unk> Depressionen haben in der letzten Generation in der Industrie <unk> .
Ich glaube ein wichtiger -- nicht das Einzige , aber ein wichtiger -- <unk> zu dieser Explosion von Depression und auch Selbstmord ist <unk> , denn ihre Standards sind so hoch und dann wenn sie diese Erfahrungen selbst erklären müssen , denken sie , dass sie in der Schuld sind .
Und das Ergebnis ist also , dass wir im Allgemeinen verbessern , und wir haben schlimmer .
Also lassen Sie mich daran erinnern .
Das ist der <unk> <unk> , der wir alle tun , und es ist falsch . Es ist nicht wahr .
Es gibt keine Frage , die Wahl ist besser als niemand , aber es folgt nicht davon , dass mehr Auswahl besser ist als ein <unk> .
Es gibt etwas <unk> . Ich weiß nicht , was es ist .
Ich bin ziemlich sicher , dass wir lange seit dem Punkt angelangt sind , wo uns Möglichkeiten unser Wohlbefinden verbessern .
Nun , als eine Politik wichtig ist – ich bin fast fertig – als eine Politik wichtig ist , es ist es , was all diese Wahl in <unk> Gesellschaften <unk> .
Es gibt viele Orte auf der Welt , und wir haben von einigen ihnen gehört , wo es nicht zu viel Wahl gibt .
Ihr Problem ist , dass sie zu wenig haben .
Das Zeug , worüber ich spreche , ist das <unk> Problem moderner , <unk> , westliche Gesellschaften .
Und was so <unk> und <unk> ist : Steve <unk> sprach gestern darüber , wie diese teuren und <unk> <unk> nicht helfen .
Es ist ein <unk> .
Was ich Ihnen sage , ist , dass diese teuren und komplizierte Entscheidungen nicht einfach helfen .
Sie haben wirklich weh getan .
Sie haben uns <unk> .
Wenn einige davon in unseren Gesellschaften in unseren Gesellschaften ermöglicht werden , sind wir in der Lage zu sein , zu Gesellschaften zu kommen , die zu wenige Optionen haben , nicht nur die Leben des Lebens , sondern auch uns verbessert werden würde , was Ökonomen &quot; <unk> &quot; nennen .
<unk> <unk> werden besser verbessern – nicht nur arme Menschen – wegen der <unk> <unk> uns .
Um zu schließen .
Wissen Sie , nichts ist möglich in dieser <unk> . &quot;
<unk> Vorstellungskraft , ein <unk> Blick auf die Welt – so lese ich es zuerst .
Je mehr ich darüber nachdachte , desto mehr ich mich auf die Sicht der <unk> <unk> .
Denn die Wahrheit ist , wenn man die <unk> <unk> , so dass alles möglich ist , es gibt keine Freiheit . Sie haben Lähmung .
Wenn man diesen <unk> <unk> , so dass alles möglich ist , dann <unk> .
Man erhöht die Lähmung und <unk> die Zufriedenheit .
Jeder braucht einen <unk> .
Dieser hier ist fast zu <unk> – vielleicht sogar für den Fisch , für uns .
Aber die Abwesenheit eines <unk> <unk> ist ein Rezept für Elend und ich vermute , eine Katastrophe .
Vielen Dank .
Last year , I &apos;ve shown these two slides in order to ensure that the North Atlantic <unk> , which has been found for nearly three million years in the size of the lower 48 states , by 40 percent .
But this doesn &apos;t apply strongly enough of the <unk> of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show you the <unk> of the <unk> .
In a certain sense , the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of our global <unk> .
It grows in winter and <unk> in summer .
The next slide I &apos;m showing you is a <unk> of what happened in the last 25 years .
The <unk> is tagged with red .
As you can see , it grows on the Arctic Ocean , this is the <unk> of ice in winter , and it <unk> in the summer .
This was called <unk> , five years old , or older , is almost like blood from the body here .
In 25 years , it will be gone from here .
This is a problem because warming is the <unk> of the Arctic Ocean , where there are massive amounts of ultraviolet of <unk> carbon , which , if you will , <unk> of microbes to methane .
<unk> with the whole amount of energy in the atmosphere , in the atmosphere , could double if we cross this critical issue .
Already today , in some flat lakes in Alaska , we have methane methane in Alaska .
Professor <unk> Walter <unk> at the University of Columbia has been traveling with another <unk> lake in the middle of winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re fine . The question is , how will it take us ?
And one reason is , this massive <unk> Greenland <unk> Greenland .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
But the volume is far bigger than ever before .
This is the Arctic River in <unk> Greenland .
If you want to know , you know , as a result of sea level , there &apos;s going to be a lot of <unk> coming up here .
Those rivers take <unk> .
On the other end of the planet , Antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
Last month , researchers announced that the entire continent has a negative <unk> .
And the <unk> , which is a couple of <unk> <unk> , is particularly intense in the middle of the room .
This is equivalent to 20 feet like Greenland .
In the Himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you can see new lakes that were a few years ago .
Forty percent of all of the people in the world are getting half of their food from that viewpoint .
In the 1960s , these glaciers are <unk> for this city .
They have <unk> <unk> .
But if they &apos;re <unk> , it also leaves most of the drinking water .
In California , there was a 40 year-old <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the Sierra River .
This is about <unk> .
And the predictions of how they read they &apos;re serious .
This <unk> around the world leads to a <unk> increase in the world .
And the <unk> of all over the world have never been seen in a really <unk> place , and never <unk> <unk> .
<unk> as many as many over the last 30 years in the 1960s , in the 1960s , in the 1960s ,
This is a completely <unk> <unk> .
If you look at this in a historical context , you can see what it does .
Over the last five years , we &apos;ve been producing 70 million metric tons of CO2 every 24 million metric every day in the oceans .
If you look at the realm of the Pacific Pacific , the U.S. continent <unk> and <unk> of Indian <unk> , where there is a <unk> decline in the ocean .
The biggest factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the <unk> of fossil fuels .
Oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem .
The United States is one of the two countries , combined with China .
And the suggestion was , well , the suggestion was to build a lot more <unk> .
But we start to see a change .
Here are the ones that have been completed in the last couple of years , with some of the green alternatives that have been suggested .
There &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
And the <unk> and <unk> have spent a quarter of a month at the store , to store clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
This image reminded me of something .
By Christmas , at home , at home in Tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> <unk> .
You saw it in the news of the news .
This is in all of our country &apos;s <unk> <unk> America .
This was about Christmas .
One of the organizers of <unk> at Christmas was this .
You know , <unk> of <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> exists in <unk> and in America , and it helps us grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> will clean every day .
It &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , and workers stay in <unk> and bread .
Al Gore : This is the source of most coal in West Virginia .
The most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
Video : Don <unk> : Let me tell you a very clear : Al Gore , Nancy <unk> , Harry <unk> , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : And so , the <unk> of <unk> has been <unk> in the world .
This is one , part of her .
Video : an actor : <unk> <unk> as a serious threat to our businesses .
That &apos;s why we put it on the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> to bring a <unk> to the place in which coal .
In fact , coal is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells pretty good .
So , you don &apos;t worry about <unk> .
Excuse us .
Video : <unk> : <unk> coal , you heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s take a tour of these modern , <unk> <unk> .
Fantastic ! This machine is pretty noisy .
But it &apos;s the sound of <unk> <unk> .
And yet , the <unk> of coal on the global warming is the <unk> of the global warming that you see here , everything changes .
Look at it right now , this is what &apos;s coming today , clean <unk> .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative comes with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
Video : Narrator : America is in a crisis , the economy , national security , <unk> .
The red line , which connects all of us , is our dependence on oil spills , like <unk> coal and nuclear oil .
But now there &apos;s a <unk> , new solution to free of us .
Eighty percent of clean electricity in the next 10 years , over the next 10 years , over the next 10 years , in the next 10 years .
A plan to bring America back to work to make us safer and help us stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> America . Find more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : Narrator : It &apos;s a <unk> of America .
One of the fastest ways , one of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , is to reduce our world as <unk> .
Man : The future is here . Wind , sun and a new <unk> .
Man number 2 : New investment to make good pay for jobs .
Narrator : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to accept reality .
Al Gore : There &apos;s an old <unk> saying , &quot; If you want to be quick , please go alone .
If you want to come down , please go together . &quot;
We have to come far from it , quickly .
Thank you very much .
At the last TED conference , I gave you an introduction to the LHC .
And I come back to come back and explain to you how the machine works .
So there &apos;s so far . And for all of those who didn &apos;t have there , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment that you &apos;re <unk> -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
And his job is to create the conditions that were less than a <unk> of the universe at the beginning of the universe , and that up to 600 million times in a second .
It &apos;s just <unk> <unk> .
This is the machine underneath <unk> .
We take pictures of these <unk> in <unk> .
I &apos;m working on this . It &apos;s called a <unk> detector -- 44 meters in diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
Here &apos;s a <unk> picture of the Hubble Space Telescope in which you see the <unk> .
On September 10th , the machine ran for the first time .
And this image was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> that <unk> all around the LHC , <unk> to a part of the LHC to release a rain of <unk> to the detector .
In other words , when we saw this picture of 9 / 11 , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
I don &apos;t know if this is the biggest <unk> of <unk> , or this one , as someone who visited Google and <unk> the <unk> .
It means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific <unk> .
And about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that we had to do with these <unk> -- these <unk> <unk> here .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> when the machine runs on <unk> .
Now , the engineers of you will look at them and say , &quot; No , don &apos;t don &apos;t . These are little <unk> . &quot;
They can afford this , because if you <unk> them very far , they will become <unk> .
So at least as a <unk> degree , as the space between the stars between the stars , these <unk> can <unk> the tension .
In one of the connections , between <unk> magnets at the LHC , there was a <unk> .
And so the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , all of this is still <unk> when you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and a half inches of <unk> .
So we &apos;re <unk> about 50 of the magnets .
They had to remove what we did .
We <unk> them , <unk> them .
They &apos;re all back back on their way back .
By the end of March , the LHC will be <unk> again .
We &apos;re going to <unk> him , waiting for the first data in June of July or July , and we continue to keep track of what the building blocks of the universe are .
Now , of course , in a sort of <unk> case of accidents , there &apos;s the debate about the value of science and <unk> in such a way .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult to reach beyond our borders , is the value of things like the LHC .
I &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words of an English scientist , which , as I guess , when he <unk> the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , who said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the design of the human mind , that there are no <unk> in nature , and there are no new worlds . &quot;
Thank you very much .
I &apos;d like to ask you to ask yourself when you were a kid when you were playing with <unk> .
While you were able to identify the hands of your hands and <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> and move , you actually learned to solve and solve problems in understanding the understanding of the understanding of the causal connections .
<unk> thinking is closely related to how we understand a lot of our surroundings .
As a <unk> -- inspired by the kinds of objects -- with my colleague <unk> <unk> and my colleague <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> : What if we used computers that move like a digital compass on a flat plane -- what if we could take up with both of our hands , and I &apos;d make it physically , physically , we could take pictures like that ,
They could be <unk> as we want ?
And this question was so <unk> that we decided to explore the answer and <unk> the answer .
In short , a <unk> is a <unk> computer in the size of a football field .
They can move through the hand , they can see each other , they can <unk> their movements , and they have a screen and a <unk> .
Much more important : <unk> are physically , so you can move them down like <unk> and <unk> .
And the <unk> are an example of a new generation of data from digital data .
And if these tools are <unk> and develop a conscious awareness of their movements , they recognize each other , and the <unk> of our <unk> with them , we can start with the discovery of new and backward systems .
I start with a couple of simple examples .
This <unk> is <unk> for the <unk> <unk> , and when I push it in a direction , the video is played , when I push it into the other direction , it goes backwards .
And these <unk> <unk> each other .
So if I put them side-by-side , you will be <unk> .
When they &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , they can notice that they &apos;re a little nervous .
And they &apos;re also feeling their movements and <unk> .
So a really interesting consequence of the interaction that we started to see was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , such as colors such as how to do that with <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and I can use it to paint paint in the middle , where they &apos;re mixed .
If we <unk> it , we can be a little <unk> .
There are also some nice possibilities in education , like languages , or <unk> , where we give the people the ability of fast <unk> and <unk> to see the results of the speed of light .
Here I am -- this is a <unk> <unk> that I used with a simple <unk> .
This is a game of words that are a kind of a mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
Basically , you get each shot on every street , randomly chosen letters , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , you will be <unk> of a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , there will be <unk> , and you have a new <unk> and new possibilities .
Thank you very much .
These are a bunch of children who came on a table at the Media Lab , and I could move them to try and take a video of it .
They really loved it .
One interesting aspect of these kinds of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give the people many instructions .
All you have to say is , &quot; <unk> words &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s a couple of people who are testing it .
This is our <unk> <unk> down there .
It turns out he wanted to <unk> the <unk> .
So for him , they were just <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
We wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
This is <unk> .
He can bring new characters into the scene by hiding the <unk> of the table , showing this figure .
Here &apos;s the Sun <unk> .
Now he &apos;s taking a dive in the scene .
Good job ! Yes !
By looking at the <unk> , and giving them side-by-side , the characters can interact ...
He &apos;s making his own story .
It &apos;s a story of <unk> , and it can decide how they evolved .
The last example that I have time to show you today is a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve been thinking recently and in the <unk> as a sounds like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
And you can put these notes into the sequence that you can <unk> in any other pattern in any pattern .
And you <unk> them by just holding a <unk> on a <unk> .
There are effects that can change live , like Hall and filters .
You hook it up with a particular tone and then tilt it into the <unk> .
And then even more <unk> effects like speed and performance that you can put on the whole sequence .
So let &apos;s see .
We start , in which we <unk> the <unk> in two <unk> and put it in a set of <unk> and add a little more of the voice .
Now I &apos;m going to give you a <unk> .
Now I &apos;m going to do something more interesting .
And now I <unk> the filters with the <unk> , so I can control the effect of my life .
I can quickly accelerate the whole sequence of the speed in one or another direction .
And now I left the filter with the <unk> , for a little bit of expression .
I can take the sequence as they &apos;re <unk> .
I don &apos;t have to put it in the <unk> of it , but I can break it down ; they &apos;re <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
And I can <unk> the whole sequence of the whole sequence , by putting the <unk> to the left .
Thank you very much .
So as you can see , I think I &apos;m excited to develop new insights that fit better how our brains and bodies work .
And today , I had time to share a piece of these new <unk> and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
So the thought that I want to leave you with is that we are on the verge of this new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media that &apos;s our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
I &apos;m <unk> .
I write books is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
It &apos;s also my big , enjoyable love and <unk> .
And I don &apos;t expect you to change it .
However , <unk> is a little bit <unk> in my life and my career that has led me completely to rethink my relationship with this work .
This amazing event was that I had written a book recently -- a <unk> <unk> called &quot; Eat , <unk> , Love &quot; -- that , I think , decided instead of all of my previous books in the world , and a major <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The result is , I don &apos;t know where I come from , as if I &apos;m going to be a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> -- the <unk> <unk> !
For example , they &apos;re all worried about me and say , &quot; Don &apos;t you say you &apos;re going to be <unk> this success ?
Don &apos;t worry that you &apos;re <unk> your whole life and never making a book again , the <unk> in the world ? Never again ? &quot;
Okay , that &apos;s really good .
But if I didn &apos;t remember , I wouldn &apos;t remember I would remember , over 20 years , when I was a teenager , when I was a teenager , I wanted to be <unk> with the same kind of <unk> reaction .
People said , &quot; Have you not been afraid of success ?
Don &apos;t worry about the <unk> of your <unk> ?
Don &apos;t worry that you &apos;re <unk> your life for a long time , and never put it on a <unk> of <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> ? &quot;
You know , you know , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m scared of all these things .
And I had always used that .
And I still have a lot more stuff of fear that no one had <unk> , like algae -- and other times .
But when I think about writing , I think I &apos;ve been thinking , why ?
Is that fair ?
Does it make sense that someone should be expected to do the work that he feels <unk> ?
And what &apos;s wrong with the creative <unk> that they &apos;re doing is not making us feel secure about the <unk> of how other jobs don &apos;t ?
My father , for example , was a chemist , and I can &apos;t remember a situation in 40 years as a chemist asked him whether he had been a chemist .
With your <unk> , John -- how are you ?
It just didn &apos;t come , you know ?
But to be fair to be fair -- the group of chemists have not been given the call of <unk> people .
We seem to be this kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but not only the writers , but the <unk> of all of us , seem to be having a term , being mentally <unk> .
All you have to do is to look at the <unk> <unk> of really great heads alone from the 20th century , which were young and often <unk> of their own hand .
And even the people who didn &apos;t actually <unk> <unk> were really <unk> by their <unk> .
Norman <unk> said shortly before his death in his last interview : &quot; Every of my books killed me a little bit . &quot;
It &apos;s a <unk> statement that you can do on your <unk> .
But we don &apos;t even know when we hear somebody like this , because we know this kind of thing that we &apos;ve been talking about as a long time ago , and somehow we accepted the perception of <unk> and <unk> that creativity and suffering , and that art -- at the end of the day , leads to <unk> .
The question I want to leave you with today is : is this idea of all of you ?
Did you think about it ?
Because if you look at a centimeter , I don &apos;t feel like I &apos;m thinking about it at all .
I love them .
And I think they &apos;re dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see how it &apos;s going to take over the next century .
I find it better when we &apos;re living our great <unk> <unk> .
And I definitely know it for me -- in my situation -- in my situation -- I &apos;m going to be very dangerous , this dark <unk> of the head of <unk> -- particularly in the middle of the stadium , in which I &apos;ve been <unk> in my career .
This is -- you see , I &apos;m pretty young . I &apos;m just about 40 years old .
I might have a 40 year-old <unk> in me .
And I think it &apos;s very likely that everything I &apos;m going to write from now from the world as the work that I &apos;m going to write from the most successful success of my last book , right ?
I &apos;m going to say <unk> , because we &apos;re all a kind of friends right now -- it &apos;s probably pretty likely that my <unk> success is behind me .
Oh , Jesus , was a thought !
These are the kind of thought that you can get somebody to get you at 9 a.m . <unk> , and I don &apos;t want you .
I would rather do that work that I love .
So the question is , how ?
After a while of <unk> , I think I can continue to be able to write a sort of a <unk> of a kind of psychological connection .
Somehow , I &apos;ve got to find a way to go through a way to be a safe distance between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction will be on the <unk> .
While I was looking for models of models in the past year , I also searched around in the past , and I tried to find other societies , to see if they could have better or simpler ideas about how to deal with the emotional risks that are associated with creativity .
This quest led me to meet the old Greece and the old Rome .
Please follow me , because the circle will closed again .
But in ancient Greece and Rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
They believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> that comes from a distant , unfamiliar source of the people -- of <unk> reasons .
The Greeks called this <unk> <unk> of creativity .
From <unk> , he said , &quot; He said , &quot; He had a <unk> <unk> who <unk> him from <unk> .
The <unk> had the same idea , this sort of <unk> mind called &quot; genius . &quot;
That &apos;s great . The <unk> didn &apos;t really think that a genius had a particularly <unk> individual .
They believed that a genius of the kind of <unk> nature was believed that it was <unk> on the walls of a <unk> -- about as <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> and the artist in the work of work , and the <unk> of the work of work , and the outcome of the work of work .
This is brilliant -- there &apos;s this , there &apos;s the distance that I talked -- the psychological <unk> that protects you from the effects of <unk> work .
And everybody knew that it worked so well , right ?
And the artist &apos;s artist was protected by a certain things , like , for example , too much <unk> , right ?
If your work was brilliant , you weren &apos;t all <unk> for you ; everybody knew you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
If your work <unk> -- not completely your fault , right ?
Everybody knew your genius was a little <unk> .
So people in the West have been thinking about creativity for creativity .
And then the Renaissance came , and all of us changed . We had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put us into the human individual , all of the gods , and there &apos;s no room for <unk> creatures , and there &apos;s no room for <unk> creatures that take orders from the <unk> .
It &apos;s the beginning of <unk> <unk> , and people started thinking that creativity was completely taken from your individual self .
For the first time in history , you hear people listen to this , or the artist , a genius -- instead of having a genius .
I have to tell you , I think that was a big mistake .
I think you know ? I think a more optimistic person thinks he or she is like the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the source of all of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , is a little bit too much of a responsibility to a <unk> , human psychology .
It &apos;s like asking someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> whole <unk> and all these <unk> expectations of success .
I think this <unk> has <unk> our artists over the last 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s true -- I think it &apos;s a question .
Can we change it ?
Maybe to come back to a deeper understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of <unk> .
Maybe not .
We may not be able to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of 500 years in a <unk> lecture .
And there are certainly people in this audience who are really <unk> scientific concerns about the notion of the notion of -- essentially , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> on their projects , etc .
I &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
But the question I want to leave you with is : why not ?
Why not think about it ?
Because it makes a lot of sense as much as anything I heard when I heard about the absolute crazy <unk> of the creative process of the creative process .
A process that -- as everybody knows you &apos;re trying to do it -- so in other words , in other words , actually everybody here -- is not always rational .
In fact , sometimes he can feel like <unk> <unk> .
I had a meeting recently when I met the <unk> American <unk> Stone , who was now over 90 years ago , and she was <unk> for her whole life , and she was told me that when she was growing up in the field of <unk> , she said , &quot; You know , she could hear and hear a poem about the landscape on her <unk> .
She said it was like a man walking out of air .
They were <unk> over the country .
She felt when it came , because it would bring the Earth under its feet to the <unk> .
She knew she could do it in such a moment , and this was -- in her words -- &quot; running like the Devil . &quot;
They ran like the Devil at the house while they were <unk> by this poem , and it had to get a little bit of a piece of paper , and a pen , so they could capture it when they were walking through it , and holding on the screen .
In other words , she wasn &apos;t fast enough , she ran and ran and ran and ran , but she ran , and she ran the poem through her , and she <unk> it , and she <unk> it , and she said , &quot; Look , I want to go on land and to look for a other poet . &quot;
And then there were those moments -- I never forgot to forget -- she said that there was <unk> <unk> in which they were almost <unk> .
So , she goes down to the house , looking for paper , and the poem is driving through her , and she picks a pencil right now when she <unk> through her other hand , and then she said , &quot; It &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s as if with your other hand , and get it .
It <unk> the poem on its tail , and moved it back in your body and took it on the sheet of paper .
With those opportunities , the poem came down and looked at the paper on paper -- but backwards from the last word for the first time .
When I heard this , I thought , &quot; That &apos;s creepy -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process works . &quot;
That &apos;s not like my creative process -- I &apos;m not the channel !
I &apos;m a <unk> . To get to work , I have to get you up at the same time , and I love <unk> and really <unk> <unk> .
But even in my <unk> , I sometimes get this thing <unk> .
And I guess many of you have done that too .
Even I had been working or ideas that came from a source of me that I don &apos;t really identify .
What &apos;s that thing ?
And how do we manage to lose our minds without losing our minds , but even at the contrary , even in domestic health ?
For me , for me , the best example of how to do this is to interview the musician &apos;s musician , and I could interview him a few years ago for a magazine .
We were talking about this topic , and you know what ? Most of the time he was alive with the <unk> of the poet modern <unk> , who was trying to master these <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> with them .
But then he was getting older and <unk> . He told me that he was driving a <unk> in Los Angeles , and he was all changed for him .
He was driving at high speed when he heard a little bit of a melody of a melody , which is often a <unk> of <unk> , and he wants to have it , and he wants to have it . It &apos;s <unk> , and he can &apos;t believe it .
He doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
So he &apos;s starting this old <unk> in him , like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose this thing , and I &apos;ll be haunted by this song forever .
I &apos;m not good enough , I &apos;m not making it . &quot;
But instead of walking in panic , he just stopped listening .
He <unk> all the <unk> and did something completely new .
He just climbed in the sky and said , &quot; Excuse me , can &apos;t you see I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Would I like to be a song like I could ?
If you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment , if I can take care of you .
If you don &apos;t , someone else &apos;s got somebody else .
<unk> and Leonard Cohen . &quot;
His whole host of <unk> has changed .
Not the work itself . It was still as dark as all of us .
But the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds him was when he took the genius of the genius , where he didn &apos;t put it as a <unk> and then he had a <unk> where he had a <unk> , and he realized that it wasn &apos;t a <unk> , <unk> thing .
It could be a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> collaboration , a kind of a conversation between Tom and the <unk> , <unk> thing that wasn &apos;t very Tom .
When I heard this story , it also transformed the way I worked , and it saved me once again .
This idea saved me when I was in the middle of the <unk> of &quot; Eat , <unk> , Love &quot; , and I fell in love with one of those <unk> of <unk> in which we &apos;re not going to work on anything , and it &apos;s not going to be done , you think it &apos;s going to be a disaster , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> book that you were written .
Not just bad , but of the <unk> of all time .
I started thinking , I should just give you the project .
But then I remembered what Tom was talking about in the quiet sky , and I tried .
So I took my look at the <unk> and I talked to my comment in a blank corner of the room .
I said , &quot; Listen , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Because you see all that I have , I don &apos;t have anything I &apos;ve done , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to have better to have it , you have to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Okay , but if you don &apos;t , you know what , you know what , you know what , you know what ?
I &apos;m still going on , because that &apos;s my job .
And I want to give you to Protokoll , which I was here for you today to be part of the work of the job . &quot;
Because , by the way , it &apos;s like , in the end , it &apos;s been answered , and centuries ago , in the <unk> of <unk> people , with sacred <unk> and music <unk> that were <unk> for hours , for the <unk> .
These <unk> were always great , because the dancers were <unk> and they were fantastic .
But again , very rare , very rare , very rare , one of the <unk> was actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I mean , you know what I mean , because I know you &apos;ve all seen a <unk> of these <unk> .
It was like the time , and the dancers were walking through a kind of <unk> , and he didn &apos;t do anything different than ever before -- a thousand nights earlier , but everything combined .
And all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to have a long time in the world .
He was <unk> by the inside , and he pulled down from the bottom , and all of a sudden he <unk> through a burning fire .
When something happened , people knew what it was . They called it to his name .
They put the hands together and they started singing , saying , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know ?
Interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came along with this <unk> , the <unk> changed over the centuries of , of course , of Allah , Allah , <unk> , <unk> , which is still listening to <unk> and <unk> .
If a police officer in Spain has done something called a <unk> , &quot; Allah , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And that &apos;s great , because we need this .
But , the hardest part of the next morning , when the dancers themselves , when the dancers themselves come and realize it is 11 o &apos;clock in a row , and there no longer a <unk> of God has been stuck in it .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and perhaps there &apos;s never going to be going to rise up again .
And perhaps someone will be calling up the names of God when he turns it , but what &apos;s going on with the rest of his life ?
That &apos;s tough .
This is one of the most primitive <unk> of a creative life .
But perhaps it doesn &apos;t really have to be full of <unk> if you didn &apos;t believe the <unk> aspects of your Facebook page of you .
If you just believe that they &apos;re a <unk> <unk> -- from a <unk> source of a <unk> time of your life that someone has been transmitted to someone else when you &apos;re done with it .
When we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
So I started thinking , and I think in the last couple of months , I think , in the last few months , when I was working on the book , I think when I was going on , as a dangerous , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What I have to say to myself is , when I &apos;m crazy about it , I &apos;m not afraid .
Don &apos;t be <unk> . <unk> just <unk> job .
Be still there for the rest of the contribution , which is also <unk> .
If your job is dancing , it &apos;s dancing .
If the dumb genius that you &apos;re sent to the site , you decide to show a <unk> of miracles by your effort , then , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
And if not , still , <unk> dance still <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; for you despite <unk> .
I believe , and I feel like we should teach this .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; for you despite <unk> , just for you to be the mere human love and the <unk> to be there .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : <unk> !
You know , I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects earlier , about the human genome , and what that might mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
In fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point of view : We &apos;ve <unk> biology , and now we &apos;re trying to move from the digital code into a new phase of biology , and we build a new life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to make major questions .
What is life ? It &apos;s something that I think many biologists have tried to understand and that on a variety of levels .
We &apos;ve been trying to simplify various approaches to <unk> components .
We &apos;ve been <unk> for nearly 20 years , when we have the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> world of biology , to the digital world of biology .
Now , we &apos;re trying to ask if we can regenerate lives , or can we make new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , <unk> <unk> that can have the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve been trying to do it with a smaller genome .
We managed to have a hundred genes at about a hundred genes , or anything that is here .
But if we look at this <unk> map , which is very simple , compared to ours , trust me , but if we look at all of these genes that we can see from one another , it &apos;s very unlikely to be a living cell .
So , we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go to research , to actually <unk> this <unk> thing that allows us to <unk> the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started to ask the question , can we a <unk> <unk> ?
Did you see the chemistry these really large molecules had never been done before ?
And if we can do that , we can start the <unk> ?
A <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> material .
Our steps of life were exponential .
Our ability to write genetic code very slowly , but still <unk> , and our last point would be on a <unk> curve .
We started with it 15 years ago .
It actually took a couple of years of starting with a <unk> Review before we did the first trials .
As it turns out , <unk> is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make little pieces of DNA from DNA , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so you can make a piece of mistakes , the more errors happen .
So we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together and correct the mistakes .
That was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome of <unk> X <unk> .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We made little pieces , we made a <unk> and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
And the exciting stage came when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> and gave a bacterium , and that bacterium started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
The <unk> of particles were <unk> by the cells and came back and killed E. <unk> .
Recently , I talked to the TED community , and I said , well , this model was exactly <unk> .
They laugh more than you &apos;re doing here , and so we think that this is a situation in which software can actually build your hardware hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to go a lot further . We wanted to build a whole <unk> <unk> , and it was more than <unk> of genetic code , so we thought we could build it in <unk> of the size of the virus that we could <unk> the size of the brain to understand what the individual components of a living cell are .
Design is the key , and when you start with digital information in the computer , this digital information has to be <unk> .
If we took the genome for the first time in 1995 , the <unk> was a mistake of a mistake per 10,000 <unk> .
We found the <unk> of 30 error ; if we used to use the <unk> sequence , it would never have been possible .
Part of the design is to make pieces of paper long and <unk> that have to go with other parts of the room to build smaller sheets of paper in order to build these <unk> .
We have unique elements here .
You may have heard that we have <unk> <unk> .
Think about it : We have a <unk> Code : A , C , G and T.
<unk> of these letters -- these letters are about 20 <unk> ; and there &apos;s a single possibility for each of these <unk> .
So we can use the genetic code to write our words , phrases , thoughts .
First of all , we have <unk> .
Some people were frustrated that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We built the pieces of furniture that we could just put on with <unk> ; there &apos;s <unk> that <unk> these <unk> and again .
And we started to make pieces , starting with <unk> , <unk> of <unk> letters , <unk> these together to make a little <unk> of <unk> to <unk> these <unk> .
In each step , we made these pieces of paper that we could <unk> them , because we tried to build a very , very <unk> process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
We &apos;ve been trying to get the <unk> <unk> .
So , this looks like a <unk> .
If we &apos;re going to get to these really big <unk> -- with over 100,000 species -- that &apos;s not just going to grow in E. <unk> , it <unk> all the possibilities of modern <unk> , and so we <unk> other mechanisms .
We knew about a mechanism called the <unk> <unk> , which is the biology to <unk> DNA that can <unk> these pieces .
Here &apos;s an example of this : there &apos;s one organism called the <unk> <unk> of the three million <unk> of radiation .
You can see in the upper branch that its <unk> can fall apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything was <unk> as it was .
We have thousands of organisms that can do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> , they can even live in a vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space and can move forward , looking for <unk> conditions .
In fact , NASA has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
Here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we made by using these processes -- in fact , we used to use these processes -- in fact , with the right design of the pieces , we <unk> them , and yeast <unk> it .
This is not a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see with the Higgs boson .
This is footage from six seconds in six seconds .
This is the <unk> <unk> that we have recently completed .
These are about <unk> letters of <unk> code . It &apos;s the largest molecule that has ever been created by people .
It has a <unk> of over 300 million .
If we were to put it with a <unk> of 10 and a half and wouldn &apos;t <unk> it <unk> pages , just to add this genetic code .
Now , how do we start a <unk> ? How do we activate it ?
Obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus that &apos;s very simple to deal with bacteria .
It &apos;s as much easier when you &apos;re doing it in <unk> like we &apos;re doing , you just take out the <unk> and you put another one in it , and this is exactly what you &apos;ve heard about <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> of the cell phones in the cell , but just recently , we &apos;ve shown that you can have a full <unk> of a <unk> of a cell to another and that can be the gateway .
We <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> . <unk> said these two times as people and mice , and so we could take some <unk> of <unk> to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing when we gave it a cell -- and it was very amazing when we gave it to a cell -- and you will appreciate our very <unk> <unk> .
The new paradigm went into the cell .
In fact , we thought , here &apos;s the end , but we &apos;ve been trying to push the process down .
This is the <unk> of evolution here .
We can see all kinds of species here that have taken a second <unk> or a third of <unk> , each time , thousands of <unk> <unk> in just a second .
So people who think about evolution as a gene that has changed a time of biology .
There are <unk> called <unk> <unk> that actually <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell was no one ; the chromosomes that we have .
It was <unk> in the cell and realized the other <unk> of <unk> materials were <unk> and so on , we had a cell phone with a new <unk> .
It <unk> blue because of the genes we had <unk> .
And after a very short period of time , it had lost all the <unk> of the species and <unk> completely in a new new new new software that we gave in the cell .
All the proteins changed the course of the brain -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we found .
It may sound like <unk> sound sounds , but we can move by changing things quite dramatically .
Now I found that this is not the <unk> -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
And I found that we may be able to build a new form of the <unk> explosion in which there could be massive new data based on this digital design .
Why should we do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
We are <unk> by nine billion people in the next 40 years .
To put it in my relationship : I was born in 1946 .
Today , three people on this planet have existed for everyone in the year of the year , in 40 years , they will be four .
We have problems with <unk> , with <unk> and <unk> water , medicine , <unk> billion people .
It &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine .
We need over five billion metric tons of coal , <unk> billion <unk> of oil .
If we think about biological processes or to replace a process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
Then , of course , there &apos;s all of the CO2 from this material that lands in the atmosphere .
We have now , from all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and I want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
The <unk> had a dozen components and looked at the diversity of it .
We &apos;re <unk> here in the limits of biological reality and at that point of our imagination .
We have technology today , because we have these rapid transport tools to do what we call <unk> genetics .
We now have the ability to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
If you think about these 20 million different genes or to optimize these processes to make <unk> or new new vaccines , we can change with a very small team of <unk> than the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just <unk> selection . We can be <unk> by <unk> , production of chemicals , and so on .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re working on , where you &apos;re actually <unk> and new species on the computer <unk> .
You know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it will look like ; we know exactly what the <unk> code will look like .
We are now focusing on <unk> of the fourth generation .
They haven &apos;t seen corn ethanol recently , which is a bad experiment .
We have <unk> of the <unk> and third generation that will be coming up with a lot of <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But , as we think , the only way of biology is to have a huge impact on the price of the price of food , or the limitation of its energy as a <unk> , and so we &apos;re working on cells that are going on .
And we think we &apos;re going to be the first ones to be <unk> of the fourth generation , and in about 18 months .
So sunlight and CO2 are a method .
But in our discovery , in the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , near <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s turning carbon dioxide into methane as a source of hydrogen as <unk> .
We can study if we could use CO2 that could be <unk> , <unk> CO2 in fuel with that process .
Within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
You know , we really have -- we really have -- <unk> targets like the <unk> industry , right ? If you can &apos;t do that at TED , where you can &apos;t be doing that at TED where ?
But the same thing we &apos;re working on right now is to use the same approach for the development of <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we &apos;re always a year at the end , and we have a dollar too low when it comes to the right vaccine .
I think that &apos;s going to be changed by <unk> vaccines in the Arctic .
So this is what the future might look like with changes in the future , can be accelerated with <unk> bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
We &apos;re not making human progress from people , but our dream is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . Thank you very much .
What I &apos;m going to show you as quickly as quickly as possible is that the basic work of a new technology that we have Microsoft as a matter of one year , that &apos;s <unk> . This is <unk> .
And it &apos;s an environment in which you can see either locally or from <unk> amounts of visual data .
We see many , many <unk> of digital photographs here , that you can see <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> in any way .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how tall these <unk> are or how large the images are .
Most of them are digital <unk> of a camera , but this is an example of a <unk> of <unk> , and it &apos;s in a field of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing the performance of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in your screen .
It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
This is <unk> House from Dickens . Every Tuesday is a chapter .
To prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not a picture , we can do something like this , to really demonstrate that this is a real <unk> of <unk> and no picture .
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
I wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
This is a <unk> case . This is a copy of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
And this gives you the pleasure and the good experience of a magazine or a newspaper article or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium of medium at several scales .
We also did something on the corner of this particular edition of The Guardian .
We designed a red display with very high <unk> that &apos;s much higher than a regular display , and we added additional information .
If you want to see the functions of these cars , you can see here .
Or other models , or even technical <unk> .
And this really does <unk> these ideas , these limitations for the <unk> place on the screen .
We hope that this is not a <unk> and other nonsense of other things -- that shouldn &apos;t be required .
Of course , the <unk> is a really <unk> application for a technology like this .
And I don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to that realm too .
But these are all roads in <unk> .
On the top line , up on the <unk> picture of NASA .
Let &apos;s take a look at something else .
This is actually live on the Internet , you can <unk> it .
This is a project called <unk> , which connects really two different technologies .
One is <unk> , and the other is a very good research about <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> university at the University of Washington , under the <unk> of Steve <unk> at the time .
And Rick <unk> was done by Microsoft , and a very good collaboration .
So this is live on the Internet ; it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
You can see this when we &apos;re creating these kinds of views that we can <unk> through images , and we can make this experience of <unk> <unk> .
But the spatial <unk> of the imagery is actually critical .
The <unk> of these tapes , they put together these pictures , so they have been <unk> the actual space that all of them have been <unk> near the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re looking at the elements of <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things were all <unk> <unk> in relation to each other .
I don &apos;t know exactly if I still have time to show you other environments .
There are those who are much more <unk> .
I would like to leave you with one of the <unk> <unk> of Noah , and this is from an early prototype of <unk> at first in the summer , to show you what I think it really does , and this is not necessarily so evident when you look at the environments that we &apos;re on .
We had to worry about lawyers and so on .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> Dame who &apos;s just in the computers .
Let &apos;s just give you an example of Flickr from Flickr , and you &apos;ll just see <unk> Dame in Flickr , and you &apos;re <unk> images of men in <unk> and on the hook etc .
Each of these <unk> <unk> represents a picture that has been discovered as to this model .
So this is all <unk> , and they &apos;re all <unk> in relation to each other .
And we can <unk> this very simple way .
You know , I never believed I would be working at Microsoft anyway .
I &apos;m very grateful for the <unk> here .
I guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : all of a sudden , all of a sudden , of course , of the <unk> <unk> , a pretty large number of them that all of you have been <unk> in this environment .
And as soon as possible , I &apos;m going to find some of the <unk> , many of you are <unk> of faces , etc .
<unk> here are a set of <unk> -- here they are .
This is actually a poster by <unk> lady that was right .
We can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
The point is that we can make things with the social environment .
It &apos;s all of the collective memories of how to look at the Earth -- and everything is connected to each other .
All these photos are connected , and there &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
They get a model that comes from all around the world .
Consider this as a <unk> of the work of Stephen <unk> on Virtual Earth .
And this is something that through the complexities of the complexity that people use , and the benefit of the user is getting bigger and greater .
Your own photos are related to <unk> <unk> that have a different person .
If anybody has the difficulty of taking care of all of these data , and knowing who they are all , then my photo of the <unk> <unk> of all of these data , and I can use them as a starting point in this room , in those spaces , the photos of other people , and I can use a kind of <unk> of social experience with the use of other people .
And of course , all of these are the vast rich virtual models of any interesting part of the Earth , not just by <unk> and <unk> and so on , but through collective memory .
Thank you very much .
CA : Chris Anderson : Are I right ? Your software enables you to be used at some point in the next couple of years , all of the images that are used by someone in the world will be connected to each other ?
<unk> : Yes . It doesn &apos;t matter if you want to put it together , and if you want to put it in between the images .
And it does this because of the <unk> in the imagery .
And this is really exciting when you think about the richness of the <unk> information that many of these images have come .
How if you &apos;re doing a <unk> for images , where you spell sentences and the text of your website contains a lot of information about it , which is a picture of it .
But how would it be if you connected with all your images ?
Then , the <unk> of <unk> and the abundance of it , is really <unk> .
<unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
CA : <unk> , that &apos;s really amazing . <unk> : Thank you very much .
You know , you know , one of the great breakthroughs in the world , and one of the most interesting studies of the research is to live with the people who remember still remember the old days in the world , and you can touch them in the wind tunnel , put them on the <unk> rocks of the plants .
Just knowing the knowledge that <unk> beyond the Milky Way , or the importance of the <unk> of the rest of the world , or that in the Himalayas , the <unk> of the <unk> will continue to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , which is the notion that the world we live in doesn &apos;t exist in absolute life , but only as a model of reality .
And as a result of a group of options , of course , as a consequence of a group of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share the same <unk> .
We &apos;re all born . We bring children to the world .
We &apos;re going through <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> <unk> of death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dancing and art .
But interestingly , the unique <unk> of the Higgs field , the rhythm of <unk> in each culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a matter of <unk> in the forests of <unk> , or the <unk> in Haiti , or the <unk> in the <unk> Islands of <unk> , or a <unk> in the middle of the Sahara , this is happened by a fellow I traveled to the desert in a month , or even a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
Everest , the <unk> of the world .
All these people teach us that there &apos;s other <unk> , other <unk> , other ways to move on Earth .
And this is an idea that , if you think about it , you can only meet hope .
Together , the <unk> cultures in the world form a web of <unk> and <unk> life that the Earth is <unk> and the good of the Earth is as important as the biology of the biology .
You can imagine thinking of this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> of all kinds of minds and dreams , myths , <unk> and <unk> that have been generated by the <unk> of consciousness since the 1960s , be defined .
<unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we are capable of as an amazing species .
And just as the biosphere became <unk> , this was happening with the <unk> -- just with even bigger speed .
Not a <unk> would suggest that about 50 percent or more of all species are just <unk> , because it &apos;s not true , and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> in the field of biological diversity -- hardly much of what we &apos;re known as <unk> <unk> in the field of cultural diversity .
And the key principle of this is the <unk> of languages .
When each of you were born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken on Earth .
Now a language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
A language is expressions of the human mind .
It &apos;s a means to which the soul of a certain culture can access the <unk> world .
Every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of <unk> possibilities .
And of these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , we don &apos;t <unk> that in the ears of children .
They &apos;re not taught anymore , and this is when they &apos;re not going to be done , they &apos;re actually already dead .
What could be <unk> as a silence of silence , one of the rest of your people who speaks your language , not having a chance to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or the hope of children ?
And yet , this terrifying fate of these awful fate on Earth somewhere around the world , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an elderly person who dies and he takes the last <unk> of an old language in the grave .
And I know some of you will say , &quot; Is it not better ? &quot; I know the world isn &apos;t a better place if we all share a language ? &quot; And I said , okay , let &apos;s be Yoruba .
Let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
And then you suddenly realized what it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
And so I &apos;d like to take you on a journey of <unk> , a little trip , through the <unk> , to try to make sense of what had been lost .
Now there are some of us who are kind of forgetting that I said , &quot; Well , if I said , &quot; I think , &quot; different possibilities of <unk> , &quot;
For example , for instance , this kid of <unk> in the Amazon River , the people of the Amazon River , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east in the <unk> of sacred snakes .
This is a human , which is not between the colors of blue and green , because the <unk> of the forest is <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> : You have to marry someone who speaks a different language .
All of these are <unk> in the Arctic Circle , the <unk> of these big houses in which the <unk> were spoken by six or seven languages , but you never hear somebody who learns a language .
They just hear and start talking .
Or , one of the most successful tribes that I ever lived in , the <unk> of Ecuador , was an amazing person who was first introduced to 1958 in the first year of 1958 .
Back in 1957 , five <unk> were trying to take contact and make a mistake .
They threw <unk> photos from all over the place , which we would <unk> as a <unk> gesture of <unk> , and what they found is that these people never saw anything of the rainforest in their lives in their lives .
They were <unk> these <unk> of <unk> , trying to see the face of the face , and found nothing and found that this was <unk> of <unk> and killing the five <unk> of the <unk> .
But the <unk> didn &apos;t only kill <unk> with the <unk> .
They <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths were done by <unk> .
We were tracking the <unk> eight generations ago , and we found two cases of a natural world , and when we looked at people with <unk> , you admitted that one of the people who died because of his age , and we killed ourselves with the <unk> , but at the same time , they had a clear <unk> of <unk> , which was amazing .
Their <unk> were able to smell the <unk> of a <unk> in 40 steps , and decide what <unk> of that <unk> were .
In the early &apos; 90s , I got a really amazing job when I asked my professor at Harvard , if I were interested in Haiti and <unk> the secret societies that were the foundation of <unk> and <unk> and the venom of <unk> and the venom of <unk> .
To give you a sense of a sense of sense , I had to know a little bit about this <unk> faith of <unk> and <unk> is not a <unk> of black magic .
On the contrary , it &apos;s a complex <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I asked you to ask yourself , what would you say ?
<unk> , Islam , <unk> , <unk> or whatever .
A continent will always be <unk> , because the <unk> didn &apos;t give you a religious belief , of course , there was one and a <unk> of this very , very <unk> of this very religious thought that during the <unk> Diaspora of <unk> <unk> .
But what seems to be interesting is that this live relationship between the <unk> and the dead relationship .
The <unk> <unk> the spirits .
Those minds may be <unk> by under the large water , responding to the rhythm of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , so that the <unk> will be a little <unk> moment to God .
<unk> say , &quot; You guys love the <unk> , &quot; you know , your white man goes to church and <unk> in God .
We dance in the temple , and become God . &quot;
And because you &apos;re obsessed with it , you will be taken by the mind , how can you be <unk> ?
Look at this amazing <unk> : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> of coal without <unk> , an amazing <unk> of the mind of the mind that this is <unk> when it gets into a state of extreme <unk> .
Now , of all of the people I met , I met the <unk> of the Sierra Leone , the Santa <unk> in <unk> , which was <unk> .
<unk> of the ancient civilization of <unk> civilization , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and in the aftermath of the <unk> of <unk> , this people in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a Buddhist continent , these people were the only ones who never were <unk> by the <unk> .
Up until today , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the training of education is very extraordinary .
The young <unk> are separated at the age of three and four years of the <unk> world , and in a <unk> world of <unk> , at the <unk> of the glaciers for 18 years , for each nine years , waiting for the nine months of pregnancy to the pregnancy of her mother , they &apos;re now <unk> in the <unk> of the great mother .
And as all of the time , you will be <unk> into the values of your society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers and their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say that environmental growth -- is maintained .
At the end of this amazing , one day , and for the first time in her life , when the first time in her life , in the age of 18 years , she sees a <unk> , and in that <unk> moment of consciousness , when the sun begins on the <unk> of the amazing beautiful landscape , suddenly all of a sudden , all of a sudden , all of a sudden , all of a sudden , all of a sudden , what they &apos;ve learned in the research is , in the course of
And he says , &quot; Look ? It &apos;s really how I told you .
It &apos;s so wonderful . You have to protect it . &quot;
They call themselves the older brothers and saying that we are the younger brothers in the world &apos;s destruction .
Now this level of intuition becomes very important .
Whenever we think of <unk> and landscape , we either <unk> and the old <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> thought , or on the other hand , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
So , <unk> are not <unk> , nor are they <unk> by <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t stay a lot of place for the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or the cold <unk> of Tibet , but still <unk> a <unk> <unk> of the Earth , which is not based on the idea , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the Earth only exists , because it &apos;s <unk> into the human consciousness .
Well , what does that mean ?
It means a little kid out of the <unk> who believes in the belief that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> , who will be a <unk> , and a different relationship with that resource or this place , as a little kid of Montana , <unk> in the belief that a mountain is a pile of stones that can be <unk> .
Whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a pile of <unk> , is irrelevant .
The interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the nature of nature .
I grew up in the forests of <unk> <unk> and believed that these forests are there to be <unk> .
This led me to another person as well as my friends , who believe that these forests of <unk> , who believe that these forests are <unk> and <unk> , who live on the <unk> of the world , who live on the <unk> of the world , who will be participating in their <unk> .
Now , when you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create various realities , you can understand some of the extraordinary discoveries of these plants .
It &apos;s a photo that I took last April in the Amazon of the Amazon <unk> .
This is <unk> , of many of you have heard , the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> .
What &apos;s fascinating is not just the <unk> potential of this <unk> , but the processing , it &apos;s really made of two different sources , on one side , there &apos;s this <unk> <unk> , which a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> smoke on its consciousness , but it <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of a family , but it &apos;s going to be <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
with the name of <unk> <unk> .
This plant contains some very strong <unk> that the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are very similar .
If you &apos;ve seen the <unk> of these things , like this stuff , this substance that it contains from various species of species in the world also .
This <unk> of <unk> is about as much as a <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> and landing on a sea of electricity , and it &apos;s not going to be <unk> of reality , but resolution of reality .
I actually met my professor , Richard Evan <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> with the discovery of the magical mushrooms in Mexico in the 1990s , and I realized that you couldn &apos;t use these <unk> as a <unk> , because in the moment , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
Because they &apos;re <unk> by one in the human intestine , of course , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
They can be <unk> with some other chemicals that <unk> the <unk> .
Now , the key thing is that the <unk> that are contained in the <unk> are <unk> of the kinds of species that are required to <unk> the <unk> , ask yourself yourself .
How can these people from a <unk> of 80,000 species of <unk> plants not find these <unk> plants , that if , in this way , can we build a sort of a <unk> version of it , so that the whole thing is bigger than the sum of its parts ?
We use this great <unk> , trial and error as a <unk> .
But if you ask the <unk> , they say , &quot; The plant speaks to us . &quot;
So , what does that mean ?
This tribe , the <unk> , have had 17 varieties of <unk> , which they see all at a distance in the woods that appear for our eyes as a species .
And then you ask them , how they <unk> their <unk> and they say , &quot; I thought you were a little bit of plants .
I mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; And I said , &quot; No . &quot;
So , it turns out you have all of the 17 varieties of <unk> in <unk> , and they &apos;re singing to one in a different configuration .
Now , that doesn &apos;t bring you to Harvard at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> . Now , the key thing is that the problem is that even of the <unk> of the <unk> , they &apos;re as <unk> and <unk> , but it &apos;s kind of limited to the past , as the real world , as the real world , our world , <unk> .
So , in fact , the fact that in the 20th century , in 300 years , for the universe , or technical innovation , but rather than a period of the time we were <unk> and <unk> the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on Earth on Earth either , the problem is not the change .
All cultures have been involved in the dancing of the dancing <unk> .
And the problem is not technology .
The <unk> didn &apos;t listen to the Sioux , when they were flying , when they bow and landed when the Americans were American when they were horse and <unk> .
Not change and technology <unk> the integrity of <unk> . It &apos;s power , the <unk> face of regime .
And wherever you go around in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not the <unk> <unk> , these are dynamically living peoples , that are <unk> <unk> of <unk> forces , whether it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> , of <unk> , a people who lived in the woods in the woods .
And now , <unk> and <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , from where they can see the river met the Gulf of <unk> , almost <unk> <unk> in the Arctic Ocean , from where the Japanese <unk> on the horizon are willing to fill up the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that they have <unk> the forest , or in the case of the <unk> .
When they were <unk> , where they were <unk> during the stadium , they were <unk> .
Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet where I &apos;m a lot of <unk> , you will see the <unk> face of political <unk> .
You know , the <unk> , the <unk> extinction of people , is <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> , the destruction of people &apos;s lives , is not only <unk> , but <unk> and <unk> as part of a <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the suffering when you haven &apos;t experienced it on the <unk> level .
I visited a young couple of weeks of a young couple of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , and when I went to <unk> , I saw the face of the statistics of you listening to the statistics of what you hear , 6,000 of those who were <unk> and <unk> , 1.2 million people that were <unk> during the <unk> of the <unk> River .
And the father of this young man was identified as a <unk> Lama .
That meant he had been killed as soon as the Chinese invasion were killed .
His uncle <unk> with her <unk> in the Diaspora to bring people to Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned as a <unk> for the crimes of the crime .
He was <unk> in the prison for the age of two years to hide under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live .
The sister who <unk> this <unk> act was brought in a <unk> .
One day , she jumped out of <unk> <unk> , and for those of you who had had to go in a <unk> for seven years , for seven years .
The suffering may be <unk> , but the most powerful minds of human beings is a <unk> .
And at the end of the day , we &apos;re really , really , really , really , like , in a more democratic world , or in a global world of diversity ?
Margaret <unk> , who said long before she died , that it &apos;s their greatest fear of <unk> that as we move towards a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , not only the whole range of the human imagination , but that we wake up a day of a dream , and forgetting that there &apos;s been some other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to think that our species has existed for 600,000 years now .
The Industrial Revolution , which brought us to agriculture , and at that moment , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and hierarchy of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> -- was only 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrial world that we know is hardly 300 years old .
Now , this <unk> story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we are facing in the coming ages .
When we ask this <unk> of <unk> , they will respond with 10,000 different voices .
And in this song , we will be <unk> the possibility of what we are : people with conscious conscious minds that are aware of the importance of people and <unk> a space , and there are great moments of optimism .
Here &apos;s a photograph I took at the northern end of the <unk> when I went on with <unk> on the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his <unk> .
The Tunisian government is not always very good with the Inuit and over the next few years in the <unk> of our regimes , they forced us to draw in <unk> .
<unk> of this old man <unk> .
The family that had been worried about his life was all of the guns and all the tools .
Now you have to know that the Inuit don &apos;t fear the cold , they use it to their advantage .
The <unk> of their <unk> were originally made of fish that were made in <unk> <unk> .
The man &apos;s husband didn &apos;t care about the <unk> night or the <unk> storm .
He <unk> out , he pulled down his pants off and he <unk> in his hand , and when the <unk> started <unk> , he <unk> it into the form of a <unk> .
He was <unk> <unk> on the sides of the <unk> and when he was completely <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and he <unk> a <unk> , he <unk> the skeleton of the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> another dog , and he <unk> on the <unk> with the <unk> on the <unk> .
You can &apos;t do anything , and this is a symbol of the <unk> of the Inuit and all the rest of the world .
In April , the Egyptian government had found the <unk> in April 1999 , 1999 , which is bigger than California and Texas .
It &apos;s our new <unk> , and it &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> area . They all control the <unk> .
It &apos;s an amazing example , like a nation , a state , which is seeking to seek and achieve .
And finally , I think it &apos;s quite evident , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant targets , to realize that they &apos;re not far from behind .
They &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
They represent parts of the human imagination that are <unk> in <unk> times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , are part of the <unk> of hope .
What we &apos;re trying to do at National Geographic is that we believe that politicians don &apos;t achieve anything .
We believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not <unk> , but we believe that <unk> can change the world , and so we may be probably the best institution for <unk> in the world , and our website gets 35 million <unk> <unk> every month .
<unk> nations are <unk> <unk> .
Our journals will read by millions .
And we take a series of trips in the <unk> where we take our audience to places of such cultural <unk> , and hopefully , they will take one of the most compelling <unk> of <unk> , that this world deserves to be able to find in many ways , that we can find a <unk> in the world that we can find a <unk> in a really <unk> world .
With the wisdom of all of us to contribute the wisdom of people to our shared well-being .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book that I already heard , and try to make connections , and try to make connections if you haven &apos;t noticed .
I want to start what I call &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> of what ?
<unk> <unk> of all western <unk> .
The key thing is , if our goal is to be the <unk> of the <unk> of our citizens , this is largely due to the <unk> of the freedom of the individual .
And the reason for this is that freedom and good , valuable , meaningful and essential is for the <unk> .
If people have freedom of freedom , each of us is <unk> to do the things that are <unk> , and no one has to decide for us .
The path of freedom to <unk> is the choice of choice .
The more choices people have , the more freedom they have , the more freedom they have , the more <unk> they have .
This is , I think , so deep in us , that it would be so far from us , to ask you to question it .
And it &apos;s also <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we &apos;re doing today .
This is my supermarket . Not big .
Just a little bit of <unk> .
There are 175 <unk> in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 different <unk> and 12 <unk> that you could buy to make a large number of of your own <unk> , in the <unk> case , in the <unk> case of the store .
So here &apos;s how the supermarket works .
Then you &apos;re going to go into a <unk> <unk> -- speaker , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , and in that one <unk> , there are so many <unk> .
We can <unk> <unk> million different <unk> from the components that are going on in this business .
They have to admit , this is a big choice .
In other fields -- the world of communication .
There was a time when I was a boy , there was a time when I had a boy , you know , I wanted you to go from Ma to Miss Bell .
You <unk> the phone and bought it .
As a consequence , the phone was never broken .
Those days are over .
We now have an infinite set of <unk> <unk> , particularly in the world of mobile phones .
These are the cell phones of the future .
My <unk> is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And if you haven &apos;t seen that till you haven &apos;t seen it in your business , I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to be very soon .
It brings people to walk in businesses and ask this question .
You know the answer to that question ?
The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s impossible to buy a cell phone , not too much .
For other people , which are much more important than <unk> , the same is true for the explosion of choice .
Public health -- in the United States , is no longer the case that you go to the doctor and you say what to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says , &quot; We could make A or B . &quot;
One has these benefits and risks .
B has these benefits and risks . What do you want to do ?
And you say , &quot; Doctor , what do I do ? &quot;
The doctor says , &quot; One has these benefits and risks and B those benefits and risks .
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; If you were a doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you . &quot;
The result is , &quot; <unk> , &quot; it sounds like a good thing , but it <unk> the burden of giving you the <unk> of someone who knows a little bit , and therefore not in the best condition , and therefore not in the best condition to decide -- namely , the patient .
There &apos;s a <unk> marketing of <unk> medicine for people like you and me , which , if you think , don &apos;t make sense , because we can &apos;t buy it .
Why are you <unk> us if we can &apos;t buy ?
Because they expect us to call the doctor the next morning and ask a change of <unk> .
Something as <unk> as our identity is now a matter of choice to be present .
We don &apos;t <unk> identity , we invent them .
And we &apos;re <unk> ourselves as much as we want .
<unk> every day when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what a kind of person wants you to be .
In terms of marriage and family <unk> , almost everybody had one , and you married so quickly and you got married as fast as you could .
The only real choice was &quot; Who , &quot; not when , and not what you did afterwards .
Nowadays , it &apos;s easy to have .
I teach wonderful intelligent students , and I give them 20 percent less work than ever before .
Not because they &apos;re less smart , or because they &apos;re less careful .
It &apos;s because they &apos;re preoccupied with other things ; they ask yourself , &quot; Should I marry ? &quot;
Or later ? Should I be children , or make you a career ? &quot;
Those are all <unk> questions .
And they will answer these questions , even though they don &apos;t make their jobs and don &apos;t get a good grade in my class .
And they should be doing that , and these are important questions .
Work -- we &apos;re <unk> like Carl <unk> , with the technology that allows us to work every minute on the planet every single day on the planet -- to the Randolph .
There &apos;s a corner of the room , by the way , I &apos;m not going to tell you a little bit about the <unk> .
I don &apos;t say anything I want to use .
This incredible freedom of choice in terms of making decisions , again , again , and again , if we should work or not .
We can play our children at soccer games , with <unk> cell phones on a hip , and our Blackberry , and our laptop probably on our lap .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute of our child when we &apos;re watching a child &apos;s eye , we ask ourselves , &quot; Should I accept this call ? &quot;
The <unk> answer ? The letter writing ? &quot;
And even if the answer to the question of &quot; No , &quot; it &apos;s going to be your experience of your child &apos;s mind , very different than it would have been .
Everywhere we go , big and small things , physical things and lifestyle , life is a matter of choice .
And the world that we lived in was like this .
I want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
And the world in which we now live in .
And the question is , are you good or bad news ?
The answer is &quot; Yes . &quot;
We all know what &apos;s good on it , so I &apos;m going to talk about it .
All these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
A effect , <unk> way , is that he <unk> instead of free .
With so many options , with so many options , people will be very hard to decide .
I &apos;m going to give you a more optimistic example of a study of investment in sub-Saharan Africa .
A <unk> of mine had access to <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different backgrounds .
And what she found was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that went down to two percent .
They offer 50 rupees -- 10 percent less <unk> than if you were only five . Why ?
Because it &apos;s 50 <unk> that are on the operators , so it &apos;s so hard to decide what you &apos;re choosing to pick it up for tomorrow .
And then tomorrow morning , and tomorrow morning , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , I never come .
Now , you know , that &apos;s not just because people have to eat <unk> when you go into the <unk> , because you don &apos;t have enough money to <unk> it , it also means that your choices are so hard to leave you with your <unk> .
If you don &apos;t contribute to 5,000 U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. dollars a year , that would have been happy to reproduce your contribution .
<unk> is a consequence of many choices .
And I think it &apos;s a concern that the world looks like this , and you really want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
They don &apos;t want to choose the wrong <unk> <unk> , or even the wrong chord .
So that &apos;s the effect . The other effect is that even when we walk through paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the outcome of choice , than if we had the opportunity between the choices of choice .
And there are several reasons for this .
One of them is <unk> by the great choice of multiple <unk> when you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what <unk> is perfect ? It &apos;s easy to imagine , and what happens is that you <unk> the choice of the choice , and this <unk> of happiness is <unk> to the satisfaction of your <unk> choice .
It &apos;s also a good choice .
The more opportunities there is , the easier it is , the easier for the choices you meet .
The second thing is , the economists call <unk> .
And then Gilbert has made a big point of time today , because he tells you how much the species of things we value when we compare things to it .
Well , if there &apos;s a lot of other kinds of thinking , there &apos;s just a possibility of imagining the potential of alternatives that you &apos;re making , which you &apos;re less happy with the alternatives that you have chosen .
Here &apos;s an example . For those of you who aren &apos;t New Yorker cartoons , I &apos;m <unk> .
But here &apos;s what you should think of .
Here &apos;s a pair of <unk> .
Very expensive <unk> .
<unk> beach . <unk> day . They have all of it for yourself .
What could be better ? &quot;
The man thinks , &quot; It &apos;s August . Everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
I could just park in front of my house . &quot;
And he spent two weeks following the thought of the thought that he has failed to have a great parking lot .
<unk> lower the happiness that we get through our choosing , even though what we &apos;re choosing is fantastic .
And the more opportunities there is to be a choice , the more <unk> properties of these choosing <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
Now , this cartoon makes some statements .
He &apos;s making a statement about this now , and perhaps as well as things slow down .
But a key point that he &apos;s doing is , whoever you decide for a thing , you don &apos;t decide to do other things , and these other things may have a lot of <unk> properties , and it becomes what you &apos;re going to do less .
Third : <unk> of expectations .
This struck me when I wanted to exchange my <unk> .
I &apos;m wearing <unk> , almost all the <unk> .
And there was a time in which there was a time in which there was a kind of <unk> , and you bought you , and you had a lot of <unk> , and if you wore them long enough , you started to have a long time <unk> , you started <unk> .
So for many years , I went to buy the <unk> for many years , and I said , &quot; I &apos;d like a couple of <unk> , here &apos;s my height . &quot;
And the <unk> said , &quot; Do you want <unk> , slightly <unk> or wide ?
Do you want buttons or <unk> ? stone or <unk> <unk> ?
Do you want <unk> with <unk> ?
You want to be cut down , <unk> , blah blah blah blah , and so on .
My foster father was at the bottom , and I said , &quot; I would love the kind of thing that used to be the only thing . &quot;
He had no idea what that was , so I spent an hour trying to <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> , and I would say -- and I say to the truth -- and I &apos;m telling you the truth of the <unk> that I had you had .
I had better . All of that choice made me better .
But I felt bad .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to explain myself .
And the reason I felt was that I felt bad about all of these available capabilities , my expectations of what a good pair of <unk> would be <unk> .
I had very low expectations . I had no expectations of <unk> expectations than there were only in a way .
If you came in 100 species , you were doomed to be perfect .
And what I got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
And so when I received what I had been expected , and what I had had was <unk> compared to what I expected .
<unk> of possibilities in the lives of people &apos;s lives will inevitably increase the expectations of the possibilities of how good those capabilities will be .
And this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though the results are good .
Nobody in the world knows this .
Because if you did it , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was going on .
Truth is more like this .
The reason is , the reason it used to be better than anything was worse when everything was worse , was to make it possible for people to be a <unk> <unk> .
In fact , today , in the world we live -- we <unk> , <unk> citizens , with <unk> as expectation -- the best thing you can hope to do is to make things as well as you expect them .
They never will be <unk> <unk> because your expectations , your expectations , are <unk> .
The secret to <unk> -- this is what you &apos;ve all come up with -- the secret to <unk> are low expectations .
I want to say -- a brief moment -- that I &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
I couldn &apos;t make it better . I didn &apos;t <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of a <unk> of a bad <unk> when there &apos;s only one way to buy it , and you ask why you &apos;re <unk> , and you ask yourself why , why ?
The world is responsible .
If hundreds of different kinds of data are available , and you buy the <unk> , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
It &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : you .
They could have done better .
With 100 different species of <unk> in the world , there &apos;s no excuse for mistake .
And so when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , you feel disappointed about it , you &apos;re <unk> yourself .
<unk> depression in the world &apos;s industrial world in the last generation .
I think a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> to this <unk> of depression , and also a <unk> of people who are <unk> , because your standards are so high , and then when you have to explain those experiences themselves , they think it would be their fault .
And so the key thing is that it &apos;s getting us better , and we feel bad about it .
So let me remember you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , which is one that we all think of right now , is completely wrong . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no question of a choice that is better than no one , but it doesn &apos;t follow that much choice than a choice .
There &apos;s a magic lot . I don &apos;t know what it is .
I &apos;m pretty sure that we missed a long time in the selection of our <unk> .
Now , as a matter of fact , as a matter of fact -- I &apos;m almost finished -- as a matter of fact , as a matter of fact , as a matter of thinking about it , what all of these choice is possible in the richer societies , that material is wealth .
There &apos;s a lot of places in the world , and we heard of many of you who don &apos;t have too much choice .
Your problem is you have too little .
So the things I talk about are a <unk> problem of modern , rich , Western societies .
And what &apos;s so frustrating and <unk> : Steve <unk> told you yesterday that this expensive and difficult <unk> didn &apos;t help .
This is a <unk> .
I &apos;m telling you that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re not helping .
They &apos;re even <unk> .
They worry that we &apos;re getting worse .
If a lot of people in our society are making decisions in societies where people don &apos;t have too much choice , not only the lives of people , but of course , of course , the lives of people will be better , but economists would call it a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> will make sure it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these great choice <unk> us .
Finally , please read this cartoon , and a wise person says , &quot; Ah !
They don &apos;t know anything in this room . &quot;
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way I read it first .
But the more I thought , the more I thought , the more I thought of the fish of fish .
Because the truth is , if you <unk> the <unk> so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom ; you have paralysis .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that everything is possible , you lower happiness .
They increase paralysis and lower happiness .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is certainly too limited -- possibly for the fish , but certainly for us .
But the lack of a <unk> <unk> is a recipe for misery , and , I guess , disaster .
Thank you very much .
