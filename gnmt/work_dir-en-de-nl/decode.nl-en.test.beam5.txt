Now , a couple of years ago , Peter <unk> here , at TED , at TED , was a <unk> .
The <unk> .
And the idea is very simple : four of them , a very large one , very large one , they Spaghetti <unk> , a Meter , a Meter and a <unk> .
The Marshmallow was he used .
And , obviously , it &apos;s very simple , so it &apos;s very nice , because this is a very good job , because that is a very schnellen <unk> .
And I think this was a very interesting way , and beschloss in a <unk> in a <unk> .
And there &apos;s a huge Erfolg .
And then , in the same way , I used this Übung in about 70 <unk> <unk> in the world , Designern , Architekten and Architekten , and , and , over the name of Fortune 500 <unk> .
And I have a lot of the Übung in people in the way that people zusammenarbeiten , and I &apos;ll give you a few davon .
In fact , the first one is that people are going to pay for this stuff .
You know , they have to talk about what was going on , and they &apos;re <unk> .
Then they set up .
And they pick up and <unk> .
In fact , they have a huge amount of time from the time of the <unk> .
And then , when the way it comes in , takes one of them to get them up and get them out of them , do get them up , do get them up and ... <unk> !
They bewundern them .
But , really , really , really , it &apos;s true that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be in a &quot; <unk> &quot; , because the very <unk> , very <unk> , has <unk> the very <unk> <unk> .
<unk> people think about the &quot; oh , &quot; <unk> than others .
And so , the real world is actually taken out of a MBA .
They are <unk> , they betrügen , get out , and they get mad <unk> .
In addition , he &apos;s out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then , for the best of these , when they are <unk> <unk> .
This is very beeindruckend .
And Peter said , dass she nicht nur the United Nations <unk> all the <unk> .
So , how do you ever think that was why ? Warum ? What do we do ?
<unk> antworten : &quot; Keine Ahnung from the kids of the spaghetti sauce of spaghetti . &quot;
They don &apos;t have an experience of <unk> .
But he &apos;s another one .
And so , dass Ökonomen ausgebildet are , um die einzig richtige Lösung zu finden .
And they have to do it .
But , was that when they got the Marshmallow , they don &apos;t have a lot of time . And so ?
It &apos;s a Desaster .
Klingt so much ?
<unk> .
They start with the Marshmallow .
They Prototypen Prototypen , and they Prototypen Prototypen .
With the Marshmallow , you know , so they have a long <unk> , and they have a very good way of making good Prototypen .
<unk> are the <unk> of Kooperation as the <unk> .
In each case , let &apos;s give a positive note to all the time , and that &apos;s how it didn &apos;t work .
So the Prototypen of Prototypen is very <unk> .
But let &apos;s see a couple of <unk> phones .
The Durchschnitt for the meisten men is about 50 inches ...
<unk> won at the least , <unk> , <unk> , and not so much .
<unk> , the meisten Erwachsenen .
And how do they do the best ?
<unk> and Ingenieuren , right .
The biggest <unk> that I &apos;m going to do is a Meter big .
And so , how ? Because they are <unk> and <unk> <unk> Strukturen , who are the <unk> of bare <unk> .
<unk> &apos;s , very much less .
But now , it &apos;s interesting : when it comes to the Team of the Team , they have a <unk> .
<unk> . The Team and thinking : &quot; Those are going to get gewonnen . &quot;
So , you know , and why ?
Because they can get out of it .
They &apos;re going to do the <unk> .
And every single Team who , well , has been <unk> and <unk> for the power of the Team .
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> , in a way .
At the same time , when they do 10 phones , they &apos;re doing this one in the six years ago .
And I took a very interesting way .
And I thought , well , I was making it a lot of aufregender .
So I got 10,000 dollars to Software on the phone .
And was do you know that these <unk> ?
What did he do ?
The one .
No one has a single <unk> <unk> .
One of the <unk> , which , in a matter , is a huge amount of magnitude , for a half .
Interesting , which has huge amounts of trauma .
We have a lot of the effort to play with the students .
And was he thinking that he was happening ?
And so , you know , they have the <unk> of Prototypen .
And the most part of the Team of the <unk> in one of the best .
They made the <unk> <unk> in the slightest .
So , that &apos;s a great Lektion for us about the <unk> and Erfolg .
What do you ever think about it was going to be an hour of a <unk> ?
And the way I work with digital Werkzeugen and Prozesse , and Prozesse , in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and visuelle Effekte .
And the <unk> of the hidden <unk> of the hidden <unk> .
Because , right , fair enough , every was a very Marshmallow .
We have a shared experience of a shared experience , a gemeinsame woman , and a gemeinsame institution , um the greatest ones in the morning .
And so , that &apos;s the value of the kind of such <unk> .
And for example , the <unk> is going to be <unk> .
In the middle of this blog , you know , you can do the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
He have a couple of minutes of all the people in the world and they set out to have a couple of years ago .
So , there are <unk> .
And the most amazing thing is , I think , really , really , is Design a <unk> .
And so , for all of our Sinne all of our Sinne , and all of our Sinne , and all of the people who are thinking , well , you know , you know , you know , you know , for the lack of the people who are on the verge of people .
And so , you know , a small way in this particular set of all the way in this particular experience , in a &quot; oh , &quot; -Moment , in a &quot; <unk> &quot; -Moment .
And that &apos;s a huge Unterschied .
Vielen Dank .
<unk> can do this by a Maschine , a giant Maschine , a <unk> .
And every one here you can .
In the same way , you can get it in the same time in the time , but not here .
I &apos;m going to tell you , was going to be like , because I &apos;m going to spend this very much time all the way out of all the time , and all of a sudden , all of them , and all of them .
All of the time they are going to be in for the second , or Twitter <unk> .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m überzeugt that he was a very , very <unk> , to <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to get there .
But I don &apos;t even talk to you .
I &apos;m not going to be out there , and not because I &apos;m going to be <unk> -- but I &apos;m sure enough of the people in the world .
They don &apos;t necessarily have to go .
So I &apos;m going to get you in the Machine and I will be in the same way .
In the same amount of time , you &apos;re living at the same time you &apos;re living in the world , and you will see Gesundheit , Wohlstand , poor , death , death , <unk> .
It &apos;s not what he did .
My <unk> starben all over 60 .
I think there were all about 70 .
And my Eltern are in the 80 .
So I kind of , in a way , I might be able to get a piece in the 90 .
But it &apos;s not just about us .
He &apos;s a lot more of it .
The way in New Delhi has been born a Lebenserwartung and a Lebenserwartung at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Think about it . This is the incredible fact .
And why is that ?
We have the Pocken . We have to have a million people in the world of the Lebens .
They have a change in the world of the same way that they were doing all the time .
But they don &apos;t have it . They are gone .
We made them out . <unk> !
In the <unk> world , there &apos;s a variety of different ways of creating Millionen of babies , so much of the more than not .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
Anyone else was here ?
<unk> , modern Medizin , for many years , all of the children of education , all of the <unk> of all the <unk> .
And for me , the wissenschaftlichen <unk> , the <unk> of all the time , and so it can work , and falls , falls no one of the größten Errungenschaften der Menschheit
That &apos;s the good news .
Leider is that all the great Neuigkeiten of all the time that he has a bunch of different kinds of other people , and one of them , and one of them is that , trotz all of our generations , he , trotz all of our generations , in the world , and every year .
We have a lot of <unk> , and so it gets schnell , and that &apos;s a Schande .
And not only did that , in fact , in fact , in the fact of the language , in the way that we have , in the world , the world is very abundant .
<unk> water , <unk> , <unk> , Gas , Gas , Gas : it &apos;s going to be <unk> , and when you don &apos;t have , you &apos;re going to have to go out .
The question is that -- can I do ?
I think it &apos;s obvious that , in the way , in the <unk> for a long country , ohne Land , an dem Land , in dem wir leben .
I think we can make all the world of <unk> , that they don &apos;t even get in the <unk> .
I mean , I &apos;m sure , and , well , no <unk> .
But that &apos;s where I lie at night -- one of the things I lie at night .
So , you know , you &apos;ve been out of the same wissenschaftlichen Fortschritt , no one and you can &apos;t , and you can &apos;t , in the way we &apos;re going to use it .
In fact , for the <unk> Fortschritten in all sorts of things .
And I think , in fact , in fact , in a few Jahren , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way for the years of the crime , and for the years , for a long time , in the same way that , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way .
And so , when they give birth to the <unk> , so that they &apos;re fast unmöglich , so it &apos;s fast unmöglich .
And , listen , all of you are right in your own opinion ; everybody agrees with a certain <unk> , but do you know , wo you don &apos;t have right ?
You don &apos;t necessarily have to be on your own Tatsachen . No , no .
And I &apos;m going to have a long time to do this .
Vor one Dutzend Jahren , I wrote a little bit about <unk> for <unk> for the New Yorker .
I mean , what I &apos;m striking to do is , in fact , in the very , very effektive <unk> for the <unk> in the same way .
I don &apos;t know very much how to do this , so I just kind of , and I kind of wrote it on and out .
I think a little bit smaller and a little bit about genetically engineered .
Again , that &apos;s the same thing , but very much worse .
People are going mad .
So I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about , and I &apos;m going to tell you , and I &apos;m not going to understand why the people &quot; <unk> &quot; were thinking , warum they thought , well , in the way that they thought , in a way , in the <unk> , a mere zufälliger Art , an der Natur .
But , you know , I was going to do this , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about , and I &apos;m thinking , well , I &apos;m going to be a Journalist , and I am a Journalist ; we wake up ; we wake up , we &apos;ll be <unk> , and that &apos;s where it &apos;s .
But the stories were kept going to me , but I can &apos;t do that , but I can &apos;t do that .
And so , for the fact , the <unk> that I didn &apos;t really have the <unk> <unk> .
They were <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So here we are , right ?
And so , that &apos;s what I didn &apos;t do so much .
But then , when I thought , well , you know , I think , right now , in this way , in a way , in the middle of the world , in the same way that we don &apos;t have the same Verhältnis bis zu Fortschritt .
We talk about he <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> because of <unk> .
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
All right , so I have a couple of these Gründe , and I think you know .
We have an opportunity to be lost in a <unk> , in a way , and in the same way , and , in the way , in the Wissenschaft , and he &apos;s not talking about .
So , you know , some set out a few set of people , and the people verstehen .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Massenvernichtungswaffen , not very good <unk> .
I &apos;m like , ever , depending on the <unk> .
And he &apos;s asking for people , and they thought , well , they thought , well , they thought that they have to do so much .
<unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , don &apos;t worry .
But here , when you get back , then , when you got back , you can do it , and you can &apos;t do it so gut .
And the way I tell you that was that , in a way , in a way , in a dead way , and you can hoffen , dass sie so früh wie möglich <unk> .
For 12 years , he has a very radical historical event , which was a Zusammenhang zwischen the <unk> of Autismus and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> are going to be set out to be out of the way that .
And so , there was a terrible thing .
The data came out .
In the United States , in England , in England , in Schweden , in Canada , in Canada , and the same results : no Zusammenhang , no Zusammenhang .
But he doesn &apos;t do it , because they don &apos;t have an <unk> an <unk> , we glauben , was an image of how we think and was thinking , was that , was it , was , was it really , really , if you think real .
We don &apos;t have an opportunity to put a lot of money in the back of the <unk> <unk> , and so I &apos;m going to get you all over and I &apos;m going to get there and I &apos;m going to get there .
But do you know ?
Now , these were kind of <unk> , <unk> , and , in fact , the United States is one of the few countries in the world , where the <unk> is one of the few <unk> in the world .
And that &apos;s a Schande , and so on .
&quot; No matter . &quot;
And was he in the way that they were able to do that ?
Now , I &apos;m going to end up . I &apos;m going to end up .
So , how do you get <unk> ?
Does anybody think of the child in the brain of <unk> ?
<unk> don &apos;t .
And so there &apos;s no way of doing it , but it &apos;s very , very <unk> in the world .
This is a lot of töten by <unk> , 20 to the <unk> .
But here , because there &apos;s no way of doing it , and the <unk> , and the people who are a Jenny <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> Live .
And they can do that , because they can &apos;t Unterscheidung between <unk> and zufälligen <unk> .
They don &apos;t understand that these things are very much at the same way that it &apos;s not real .
And so , that &apos;s etwas , das wir lernen müssen , und so schnell müssen wir lernen .
This one you have , Jonas <unk> .
There was a unserer schlimmsten <unk> .
No way , no <unk> . <unk> , <unk> !
The one in the first place in the right .
It &apos;s called Paul <unk> .
And there they set up a Impfstoff at the <unk> <unk> .
This is the one in the world of 400,000 to about 400,000 children in Entwicklungsländern .
Okay , right ?
Well , it &apos;s okay , except for Paul <unk> , with <unk> , and how wertvoll they are .
And so people can get out of <unk> .
And so , there &apos;s so much better .
So , Paul &apos;s a Terrorist .
As soon as , when there &apos;s a öffentlichen Talk , it can still be in <unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> to be in the <unk> , because he &apos;ll give them a lot of the way that they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
And why ? Because Paul has a Impfstoff .
I don &apos;t have to tell you , but they are <unk> .
People are going to get away , and they got to get back to this and that &apos;s very , very common Krankheiten .
We have a <unk> in this country .
And it &apos;s still <unk> , and bald will he sterben a lot more to the way that it &apos;s going to happen .
And they don &apos;t even have to go to <unk> .
So , was do you know ?
One of the ehemaligen <unk> in a couple of weeks , and I have a couple of weeks ago , and I said that they were a very special <unk> .
Nobody did this one .
They didn &apos;t even give it to the <unk> .
In this Fall .
Gut .
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have a <unk> .
Yesterday , there won &apos;t be a <unk> .
But , you know , now , morgen he would have to go to a farm in Lagos , and it &apos;s going to be in Los <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be in Los <unk> .
In a couple of Stunden where there is a search and <unk> a Auto and comes to Long Beach , where there is an amazing TED conference .
And then , after you don &apos;t think that there is a <unk> Krankheit , and we don &apos;t know , so we don &apos;t know so much .
This is the planet that we &apos;re living . This is not a <unk> .
We &apos;re just going to stay out of <unk> .
Is there any <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , am Tag ?
I &apos;m sure , because the help of the U.S .
They <unk> it , and they &apos;re using alternative Medikamenten , and so he doesn &apos;t recognize how long , you know , why you didn &apos;t understand , so much .
The data is very different for that .
They &apos;re getting down the Urin . And virtually so efficient .
OK , when you &apos;re 28 Milliarden Dollar for the <unk> Urin for the <unk> , and so it &apos;s so .
<unk> Urin . <unk> .
You know , why do you know ? Why do you know ? I think I &apos;m going to hear that , I think , I &apos;m going to know , I don &apos;t know , right ?
We hassen the <unk> . We <unk> the <unk> .
And so , there &apos;s a lot of it . Unsere <unk> are <unk> .
They are for Millionen unserer <unk> .
In fact , they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> and <unk> for all of us who are going to give them a cash .
We are running out of it , and where are we <unk> ?
We shot in the poor by the poor <unk> .
It &apos;s amazing . I am a big <unk> .
But , well , you know , this is very , very long , and he has a long run of money .
I have a couple of things here .
<unk> , Täuschung , <unk> , Täuschung , <unk> , I don &apos;t know that , but we don &apos;t know , but he &apos;ll pay for a half dollars .
And you know , when I was going to start , when I was going to start calling all the people , and they say , &quot; Was why was that ? Let &apos;s do that ?
They &apos;re very good for them . &quot;
And you know , you know , was wrong .
Because I don &apos;t care about the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that says , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t have an effect , an dem , was my Experten in <unk> . &quot;
One of the other <unk> , who are Patienten mit <unk> .
So , when you start , you start with <unk> and <unk> , and , you know , <unk> , where people can &apos;t succeed .
<unk> in the South Africa of <unk> <unk> .
There is a <unk> for 400,000 people , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> were effektiver as the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
Hundreds of thousands of <unk> töten in a country , in a way , is that , in fact , more than anything else .
Don &apos;t tell me that these things have no deal .
They have them . They have them .
Now , the most common natural natural world is that , in fact , there are the <unk> Kampf between the <unk> of <unk> and the organic <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> . It can stop .
It &apos;s about Wörter , Metaphern .
<unk> , not Wissenschaft .
All of us , all of us , every <unk> Reis , each <unk> , every <unk> , of every <unk> , has been <unk> .
So , for a minute , he said , &quot; <unk> Paradies . &quot;
This is not <unk> .
We don &apos;t have any <unk> . All of them .
We schufen them in the very few 11,000 Jahren .
And some of the ones that we were going to do was that they didn &apos;t mix up .
We didn &apos;t care about that .
You can do that very <unk> .
And so , there &apos;s a huge amount of <unk> .
But we can make a Reis in the <unk> A in a healthy way , and they have a long way to live and have long lives .
You know , how do we not ?
I can tell you , I don &apos;t know .
We &apos;re not a genetically engineered treatment .
And why ?
Well , that &apos;s the way that all of you can do : a lot of Chemikalien , Pestizide , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and , at the very large , very large environment , so that it &apos;s very massive .
We don &apos;t need to do Firmen who are living in a living <unk> .
We don &apos;t believe in the <unk> in the <unk> .
And you know , was that I &apos;m telling you ?
You know , he have right . <unk> , and he .
It &apos;s where it &apos;s true . It &apos;s not a Wissenschaft .
It doesn &apos;t have an <unk> .
This is the end of the woman , Moral , <unk> .
In fact , there is no <unk> .
No country .
We don &apos;t know ; it &apos;s a shot .
And it &apos;s a shot , and it &apos;s still , and it &apos;s still not .
But the fact that , in the way that you can do this is not enough for our own work , because he really , for a long time , and Millionen von Leuten aufzuhören , Millionen von Leuten aufzuhören .
In the 50 years , in the 50 years , we &apos;ve got 70 percent food in the last 50 years .
70 percent .
This is a picture of the Investment in Africa for the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
They can get out of it , and we can just take them out .
And the talk ? <unk> <unk> .
We can &apos;t support the <unk> food as <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> is the fact that it &apos;s worth the power of a billion to <unk> .
We have a lot of Kalorien . <unk> .
In fact , it &apos;s not an infection to Proteinen , and researchers have an <unk> , and they have an <unk> .
And so , you can &apos;t get food in the way that you &apos;re blind .
They didn &apos;t cheat in a way , and they know how ?
That might be perfect . It &apos;s not going to be <unk> , but it wäre toll .
And I said , well , so I can tell you that , why are we ?
I mean , can you even ask : why are we like ?
Because we don &apos;t really have to <unk> ?
This is about Gene . It doesn &apos;t have to be with Chemikalien .
So , you can &apos;t , too , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not about Rice <unk> , where it &apos;s going to be like , Menschen in life .
And that &apos;s where you &apos;re beginning to see , was the way that it might say .
Because , well , guess what ?
When we didn &apos;t do it and weitermachen as well , they &apos;re guilty , they &apos;re guilty for a very , very <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t have any other way of doing that .
It &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , and he can really do it .
And then , after that , in this sort of <unk> <unk> , maybe you &apos;d like to say , &quot; You can do this with the lächerlichen Long Now <unk> ? &quot;
Absolutely . <unk> I will .
Now , they &apos;re in the right now , but we have a fantastic Chance .
We can do the Time for all of this , for all of you .
We can put them in a middle of a right , and they &apos;re going to be able to do it , and we &apos;re going to go back to them .
We can walk out of the <unk> , and we can have an <unk> , but when we reach out and walk out , and they &apos;re going to be happy , and they &apos;re going to be very good for .
I &apos;m thinking , well , I can do it , and that &apos;s , for a very , very , very <unk> .
Vielen Dank .
Vielen Dank .
The New York Times
Steve <unk> , walk an hour ...
In the middle of Los Angeles ...
And then , when there &apos;s fantastic Musik .
They come from one .
<unk> you .
<unk> , <unk> , obdachlos .
On the other hand , you &apos;re looking at a Geige with two Strings .
I have a lot of all of you know about all of you know ...
The addition of Steve was made by Steve ?
I think for a very nice part , a film made for a film .
Robert <unk> <unk> playing the part of Steve <unk> ...
JO <unk> Anthony Anthony <unk> .
The very serious <unk> <unk> .
Those of you who are made out of the way they took up ...
And so , for paranoid <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> in ...
And 30 years later , there &apos;s been obdachlos .
In the world of Los Angeles .
You &apos;re going to be talking about Steve &apos;s Buch or the Film .
Not only for the rich Band ...
They were born between those two Kerle .
But for the sake of Musik , the role of Musik spielte ...
I think there &apos;s a personal status when I said ...
We have to get rid of the <unk> .
I come in 2008 in 2008 .
In a <unk> .
There was a <unk> and <unk> Symphonie from Beethoven ...
And they come up and they set up .
There &apos;s an <unk> and Social and soziale Art ...
Over <unk> and Hillary Clinton .
<unk> said that the Dodgers won &apos;t get the World Series .
All of this in a very difficult <unk> .
In the letzten <unk> of Beethoven .
We talk about Musik . I &apos;ll give birth to a piece by Steve ...
I think that the <unk> of <unk> can give you a <unk> of <unk> .
You know , you know , <unk> are not going to be <unk> .
And then , as soon as there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> ...
And this is what they &apos;re going on in there .
Now , that &apos;s when it &apos;s ...
<unk> of Schizophrenie .
In the schlimmsten <unk> ...
<unk> ...
We just wanted to go through this .
There was an <unk> <unk> .
And you &apos;re living with the <unk> and the Unordnung of life in your head ...
It &apos;s a huge scale .
In this way , in this way , in a way , in the <unk> .
And then , when we started the first kind of meeting .
There &apos;s a <unk> glow in the <unk> .
It &apos;s going to end up .
And there &apos;s about ...
<unk> Dämonen and Rauch ...
And one of the ones that we were going to have in a food form .
I have a lot of stress .
Not for me , I didn &apos;t know what about .
I don &apos;t have to get rid of it .
I think there might be a change in this way .
And I think that I was with the <unk> .
I think when I started <unk> ...
<unk> and other exciting things ...
of that , for a long time , of that .
So I started to walk out .
I am the first part of the <unk> of Beethoven .
And when I was looking at ...
I think there &apos;s a very klare experience .
In the <unk> .
And so , when you did that , you can do a perfectly good <unk> .
I think a chemical kind of thought , I think , ...
The spread of what .
The <unk> Erregung , of <unk> ...
<unk> in response .
In quiet Neugier and <unk> .
So , when you got to get your own Geige , there would be a <unk> .
And I started talking to the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> ...
<unk> , <unk> .
We started talking about Musik , of Bach ...
<unk> and <unk> ...
<unk> , every B .
From <unk> to <unk> .
I think there was no longer ...
I think there &apos;s a <unk> positive <unk> .
But , you know , in the middle of the Musik .
And so , there &apos;s a lot of passion .
And that &apos;s the way I and my Kollegen ...
Over the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
So , by the way , Musik and about Musik , to reden ...
And you know , you know ...
of the paranoid , you know ...
<unk> the streets .
from Los Angeles .
<unk> ... <unk> ...
brillante , very serious Musikern .
<unk> is <unk> .
For <unk> , Musik is a gesunden Geist .
Now , in order to make Musik like this .
and <unk> ...
And by the way , through your face and the right .
In the way .
So , so <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> .
I think that the Essenz of the arts is .
This is why we &apos;re doing Musik .
Because , you know , it &apos;s all wrong in all .
<unk> .
Unsere Emotionen .
And so , in terms of the künstlerischen head ...
In fact , through the <unk> , the Emotionen can verzerren in the way .
The reality of the <unk> ...
All of you have .
We have getroffen , inspiriert and <unk> .
<unk> ...
This is a bunch of thousands of seconds ago .
The <unk> power of Musik , and that made it possible ...
in a single <unk> .
that they were going through ...
Those of you who are <unk> .
and they turn out .
I &apos;m always going to play with <unk> .
Ob in Walt Disney <unk> Hall ...
And there &apos;s an idea of an <unk> .
I don &apos;t have a <unk> .
Danke .
Danke . Thank you .
Robert <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be able to get a piece of <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> me .
I am a couple of <unk> <unk> .
For every 10 years , I &apos;ve been working for Spiele .
And my time for the nächstes Jahrzehnt , for the very , very simple , ist , in the real world , in the real world , in the real world , so on .
Now , I have a plane , and the plane will be <unk> , and all of the people , you know , will be <unk> , um an experienced and besseren Spiele .
In the way , we &apos;re hearing three Milliarden Stunden pro Woche online .
Some of you think , &quot; Well , that &apos;s a lot of you can play Spiele . &quot;
And so , for a long time , there are so many of the great kinds of problems in the real world that we can do .
But in my case , I think , in the Institute of Technology , the <unk> for the <unk> , which is true .
Three Milliarden Stunden pro Woche is not genug , in the world of <unk> problems .
See , I think , in the case of the year , I think , when the nächste Jahrhundert in the world is going to survive , that we can have the power of <unk> .
I &apos;ve been berechnet , in the middle of the day , in the middle of the Woche .
Now , that &apos;s a very strange idea , so I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
As many of us , as Hunger , Armut , global , global , global , global , I think , dass wir versuchen , to spend more 21 Mrd. hours right now for the next 10 years . No , I &apos;m really sorry .
This is the talk . This is very good for all of these Spiele , which is very good for the people in the world .
This is a Portrait of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And there ’ d ever been going to the emotion of <unk> .
So , there &apos;s a <unk> for the Spielern of the <unk> .
And that &apos;s a very typical experience of happy .
Now , when you don &apos;t have a <unk> , it &apos;s got a little delusion in this one .
So , you know , the sense of <unk> , a little bit of a way , but very much , but a huge amount of power , a very schwieriges Problem .
When you &apos;re a <unk> , you &apos;re a couple of Nuancen here : the way that it &apos;s all about the eyes and the Mund of the <unk> .
And the beauty of the <unk> in the <unk> .
This is a <unk> that &apos;s called a <unk> <unk> .
Ah , you know , right . Okay , good .
So here &apos;s a couple of <unk> here .
A <unk> <unk> is a very positive <unk> , so positive , dass man no longer wusste , dass es bis zum <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t even matter .
And when you &apos;re here , you &apos;re überrascht , you &apos;re <unk> , was a <unk> .
This is a price of the <unk> <unk> .
And this is the end of all Millionen <unk> in the way that you &apos;re looking at all over the world , but in the case of the <unk> for the years .
The one of the people who , in all Erwartungen , at the point of all the time is a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
But , too , really , you know , in the täglichen Lebens , in the täglichen Lebens , when they take pressing problems .
I mean , this is , I was &quot; I Ben <unk> &quot; , was &quot; The <unk> was &quot; .
And I think it &apos;s all I did , right ? Yeah . All right . Gut . Gut . Gut .
This one , I am the &quot; I Ben No Good Samaritan &quot; .
This is a very Graffiti one in Berkeley in Berkeley , California , where I was in my PhD , in the same way in Spiele .
And this is a lot of the Spielern .
Wir fühlen , dass wir nicht so gut sind in the right way in the right .
And I &apos;m not going to be like gut , I don &apos;t know , very erfolgreich , all of that .
You can do it in Games . But I mean , but I &apos;m like , well , I can offer you a lot of it , etwas zu tun , an <unk> , inspiriert zu arbeiten .
And when we &apos;re in a Videospiel , I think , glaube I , the meisten people in the best face of ourselves , the <unk> , which most of us have .
For a long time , for a long time , for a long time , for a long time , you can stay out of it .
And then , in the real world , the <unk> <unk> , when we are concerned with Hindernisse , we &apos;re very often not .
We have <unk> . We &apos;re very <unk> .
We Feel Fine , rather , very , very , very , very <unk> .
We don &apos;t have the Gefühlen of the people .
They don &apos;t have to play it .
So that &apos;s how I was going to study when I was going to study a class .
So , for a part of a part of Games , do you not feel like , if you can &apos;t get anything ?
And so , how do we get the creative <unk> and apply them to the real world ?
So I kind of looked at Spiele , so of Warcraft of Warcraft , and so on , for many of the <unk> <unk> Umwelt .
And I started to get a couple of things in the right place in the online world .
One of the first that I realized is that every single one of the <unk> of Warcraft , and most of Warcraft of Warcraft , he has a lot of individuals who are made by a <unk> Auftrag .
But not just a line , a line , a line that looks at the way that it &apos;s rational an <unk> . Right ?
So , you can do it .
They don &apos;t have a Herausforderung that they don &apos;t have a Herausforderung .
But it &apos;s an absolute <unk> .
But he has no Arbeitslosigkeit in World of Warcraft .
They &apos;re not supposed to be <unk> .
It &apos;s a very profound one , and so it can happen .
And he &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
Every person in this way , he , he , is a couple of tausende kids who are paid to get out of a living <unk> .
This was a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very <unk> .
And so , that he has a special narrative , and this fantastic thing that tells us how to tell you and was here .
And so all positive Rückmeldung that we have .
You know , you know , of the <unk> and <unk> power , and <unk> Intelligenz .
<unk> <unk> in the real world is not a living .
As I kind of sitting here in the middle of this room , I don &apos;t have to get an email from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I mean , I &apos;m not going to get a positive word .
Now , the living world with the world of Warcraft as the World of Warcraft , so that it &apos;s very fond of the amount of time in the middle of a year , and so on , all of the time , for all of our time , for all of our time .
So , it &apos;s the way the right thing .
<unk> of World of Warcraft , and all of these have <unk> Millionen years of living in the same way that they were living at the same time .
Now , that &apos;s not a se .
I think it &apos;s very good .
At the same time , for sure enough , there were <unk> million years ago , the first person in the first place .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
So , when we &apos;re talking about the amount of time in the way that they &apos;re living in the classroom , the only way in the way that they might have , in the same way , is that , in the same way , in the same way that you &apos;re talking about in the same way that it &apos;s true .
But it &apos;s also true . Because it turns out that , in the way that we &apos;re living in the way that they &apos;re living in a long time , we can see where people are living in .
So , in a way , in a very different way , it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
This is where I think that .
So , think about this interesting thing .
This was a Forscher der University of the Carnegie Mellon University .
One of the most likely junger ever , in a middle school , in a middle of 30 years , is to have 10,000 Stunden long , you &apos;re going to have to have a decade long ago .
Well , 10,000 Stunden is a very interesting number for two Gründe .
One of the first , for a minute in the United States , is an hour worth the amount of time in the classroom of the fünften <unk> , for the fünften <unk> , bis hin zum <unk> .
So , you have a long set of education , where we have a long <unk> of medicine , so many of you beibringen so many of the rest in the classroom .
Now , some of you know about <unk> &apos;s <unk> &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
So , you know , well , you know , you know , you know , the 10,000 Stunden <unk> are <unk> .
In fact , it &apos;s an amazing , <unk> Studie , which says that , when you &apos;re paying attention to 10,000 years old , you might be able to do so much , if you were 21 years old , he <unk> .
We &apos;ve got to be very good at the way that we do it .
And so , for example , this is a whole Generation of developing kids who are <unk> in the <unk> .
So , the big thing is : &quot; Wo are the <unk> ? &quot;
Because , as we can go back , we can have a very happy person in the human Potential .
This is a lot of the people who are now in the world right now to play a hour of online games .
This is our <unk> .
500 million people who are incredibly good at all .
And in the other decade , there are another 2,000 players in the same way that they were paying less in a way .
Well , when you don &apos;t know , this is where it &apos;s .
So , the <unk> is <unk> , which has not been able to have a lot of power , and with drahtlose <unk> , so the <unk> Internet of the world , the United States of all over the world , most of the world , China and Brasilien online .
They think of a billion players at the same year , but in the other decade .
This is a 1.5 month .
I wondered , in a way , in the same kind of <unk> .
I have four of them . The first is <unk> Optimismus .
All right . This is like extreme <unk> .
<unk> Optimismus is the same way of doing it , and to <unk> a <unk> , which is a <unk> , mit the Glaubens , mit dem Glauben , dass wir Zugang zu Erfolg haben .
<unk> can tell you , &quot; <unk> &apos;s a <unk> &quot; where it &apos;s always <unk> , and so it can happen .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> in the <unk> of a dense <unk> .
So he has a lot of interesting footage , in fact , in fact , when we &apos;re talking to the fact that they &apos;re having a Spiel to play with them , all of them , all of them .
The talk can you ever get a Spiel to play a Spiel .
We vertrauen the way that they spend their time in the same way that they wanted to play the same Regeln , dass sie an demselben <unk> streben , so that they are still alive .
So , a Spiel here , when you get a Spiel , the <unk> and Zusammenarbeit .
And then , in a way , we have a lot of the difference in China &apos;s population .
<unk> . Great .
So , he &apos;s a talking about the same World of Warcraft , at the same time , at the same time , for 22 Stunden , and so , very much as an <unk> .
Because that &apos;s because , when you &apos;re having a Spiel , we &apos;re also glücklicher to work , and so , very often , very , very , very , very <unk> .
We know , when the people are made by the way , they made Mühe to the <unk> .
And the Spieler are gewillt to work very often , when they get the real stuff .
And then , <unk> Bedeutung .
<unk> have an opportunity to bring out an ad out of <unk> .
And so , very , very , very <unk> ,
You know , all of you know Wikipedia , the greatest <unk> in the world .
The second world in the world , with fast 80,000 pictures , the World of Warcraft .
In fact , five million people at the same time .
They have <unk> of World of Warcraft to the Internet of Warcraft , in the same other way in the Internet .
They set up a special thing .
They have a <unk> <unk> about World of Warcraft .
Okay , this is four <unk> that has a different one .
<unk> are <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
One of the things that they &apos;re glaubt is that they &apos;re individuell in the <unk> .
And the only way that they &apos;re glaubt is that they &apos;re living in their own virtuelle Welten and not the real world .
This is the Problems , das ich versuchen will .
He &apos;s a Ökonomen , Edward <unk> .
<unk> is brilliant . There &apos;s a lot of the way that people spend so much time and the power and the power of labor and money on .
And so , &quot; We don &apos;t have a single deal with no less than a real body <unk> in virtuellen Welten and online . &quot;
And there &apos;s a Ökonom , which is also rational .
And so , there &apos;s no way I , I &apos;m a <unk> . I &apos;m <unk> .
But there &apos;s a lot of the logical thing that it can do is that the <unk> can be killed in a way in the real world .
They can have a gesellschaftlichen experience in Spiele , in the real world .
And they have a besseres Feedback positive Feedback and you feel <unk> in the real way .
The way that it says is that the Spielern of the fact is that the players spend more time in virtuellen Welten in the world .
Well , I also got a very rational way of thinking that that &apos;s rational .
But there &apos;s no optimal situation .
We really have the real world to do very well .
And so I took my own Inspiration for a very , very <unk> way .
This is a very powerful part of <unk> . Okay ?
And then , for the cool , we have <unk> .
And that &apos;s the first of all Werkzeugen of Werkzeugen to that , in <unk> , entworfen von Leuten .
And then , when they come from the alten <unk> <unk> <unk> , they may be familiar with this .
The Erfindern of the first Spiel and how they saw .
<unk> said that Spiele , the <unk> , were <unk> in the Reich of <unk> in the <unk> .
In fact , what this was happening in this is that , in fact , that König of <unk> entschied to convince you a little <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> .
It &apos;s a extreme situation .
So , you know , <unk> , they made <unk> <unk> .
One year , everybody &apos;s food .
The next year , everybody &apos;s playing .
And they &apos;re going to be in the way that they &apos;re going to be in our <unk> , because of the fact that they &apos;re so exciting , and so , in such <unk> , in the <unk> , so that they didn &apos;t have a food supply .
The next year , they were playing <unk> .
And they took the second .
And they thought , well , they were going to give back 18 years of all .
They überlebten a single Hungersnot by the one day , and am am nächsten Tag to play .
Well , I think , well , I think , right now , in the way that we &apos;re using Spiele .
We &apos;re able to work for the living world of the real world .
We &apos;re using them , for all of them , in the real world , in the real world , all the way in the real world , and all of it , was not very <unk> , and they have an experience .
But here is not going to end up .
This is very exciting .
After 18 Jahren , in 18 Jahren , in a variety of <unk> that we didn &apos;t have .
So , the König of this is that they were going to be a very lucky <unk> .
They teach the entire Königreich in two .
And they ’ re going to play the <unk> , and the subject of the Spiel of the Spiel of the <unk> .
They were going to be <unk> , and they moved to a neuen neighborhood .
So , so far more than that , in the way that they were going to survive in the <unk> , and hoffentlich , and hoffentlich , they &apos;d be able to do the Zivilisation differently .
Now , that &apos;s very nice , right ?
But in fact , in fact , the <unk> showed that the <unk> , who are suffering from the <unk> , the same DNA as the natural gas .
And so researchers have a special theory of <unk> theory , which is very special .
And Geologen figured out at the fact that , in a Klimawandel , fast 20 years , in this situation , in this situation , in a way that we might be able to erklären that this was true .
And I think this very nice thing can do .
And so , in the way that they can get out of the <unk> , in the way that they come in , in a Spiel , in 18 Jahren , and so , in a Spiel , and so so , so many wussten they were going to be in the same way that they were going to get their own Zivilisation in the way that they were going to go .
Okay , so we can .
We are living of Warcraft in 1994 .
The first kind of <unk> in World of Warcraft . That &apos;s what &apos;s about 16 years ago .
They were going to work in 18 years , and they were living in 16 years of Warcraft .
I said , well , I &apos;m going to get out of our own epic Spiels .
In fact , they took the helped in the first place in the children .
So , that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to spend my 21 Milliarden Stunden in the morning .
We &apos;ll give that many of us to spend a Stunden an hour , and for a hour , for many times , in the real world .
Well , I know , I know , I was thinking , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , when you &apos;re living out of life ? &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to spend the letzten few years in the last few years , the <unk> .
We have a <unk> in the middle of Palo Alto , and the way that we &apos;re going to tell , in the case of how we can Umgang mit the <unk> .
We don &apos;t even have to acknowledge it .
We &apos;re just making sure .
We can just imagine the best way of doing it .
And then , when we give people the power of the power , the cause of Realität .
We will have a huge impact on it , and yet , and when people give the money to the <unk> , they have a positive <unk> .
I &apos;ll have a couple of these things for three Spiele , and I have a couple of times , um Leuten zu ermöglichen , ihnen zu geben , um an <unk> <unk> zu können in der Zukunft .
Okay , that &apos;s the world Without Oil .
In 2007 , in 2007 , in 2007 .
This is a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , but we have genug <unk> , um an average person in the real world , and so on , when you &apos;re living on the planet , if you don &apos;t have an Öl .
And his father &apos;s <unk> and <unk> die , who man will , zeigen , was the right cost of Öl , who has gone wrong , so you know , as the <unk> has been beeinflusst , oder the classroom has been <unk> , or the classroom are geschlossen .
And , you know , you know , when you &apos;re alive , like this , when that &apos;s true , if this was what was happening . And then , and then , you know , he , he , he was a Blog to launch Videos , Videos and Fotos .
This is a Spiel of <unk> names in 2007 .
And we folgten for them for the three years .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that this was a <unk> Erlebnis .
No way , no one will be able to change the way that it &apos;s good for the world , or for the way we can .
But when you put them in a <unk> <unk> and they said , &quot; We don &apos;t have to do it . &quot;
This is a fantastic way of looking at it .
So , for example , you &apos;re going to be able to see what was going on .
And the best of the players they did was they kind of <unk> in this Spiel .
So , for the nächsten <unk> , they beschlossen , in a way , many times , many of it , many of it .
We created a Spiel called <unk> am Institut for the <unk> .
One of the things that you saw was that a Supercomputer and 23 Jahren in terms of the Earth .
Now , this Supercomputer that was called Global <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We asked people to get online to a Jerry <unk> film .
You know , I mean , Jerry <unk> , the <unk> is a <unk> .
You know , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to have <unk> the world .
But in fact , in the middle of a way , they have an average of five people in the <unk> , and everybody in the <unk> , and so it &apos;s our Job to work in the <unk> , the <unk> of Ernährung , der Zukunft of Gesundheit , the Zukunft of Gesundheit , the Zukunft of all the <unk> .
We asked 8,000 people to play in eight Wochen .
In fact , 500 of the great kreativen <unk> , who ever been in Google <unk> .
And then , in the same game , we put it in three März . This is a Spiel in Zusammenarbeit with the World Bank .
When the <unk> were <unk> by the World Bank , when the World Bank Bank , 2010 , 2010 , 2010 , 2010 , 2010 .
<unk> with <unk> Africa , and we <unk> them , and we <unk> them , um soziale Innovation .
We have a <unk> . We have a <unk> . Wir haben a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , sehr , very , very , sehr <unk> .
I &apos;d like to give you all of this work to share with kids , all the way in the world , mostly in the world , mostly in <unk> , the Vorteil of getting out of it ; their own friends in the world , and their own hands in the world .
So I &apos;m going to get down .
I will ask a question .
And was do you know ?
We have all these amazing guys , and they have all these Spiele , the Ideen of all who we can do , but none of them have the real world .
Well , I hoffe , dass all the way that the players are becoming a menschlichen <unk> that can do the real world , dass Spiele a rich woman can have a rich Plattform for Veränderung .
We have all these amazing <unk> , <unk> Produktivität , the way it &apos;s going to be a dense , the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , the response of <unk> Optimismus and a <unk> .
I really hoffe , dass , in fact , in the same way that they &apos;re capable of doing that , in the same way that you can have , in the way that you &apos;re living on the planet .
And my hoffe , that they &apos;re going to do , in the way that they &apos;re sitting in doing Spiele .
At the same time , I &apos;m going to work in the nächsten 10 years , I &apos;m going to have a couple of all of these Dinge , dass wir all right in all of their own friends , and all of you can do all the Spielen of all the Spielen .
So I said , well , let &apos;s start with the <unk> .
Vielen Dank .
For a long time , I am interested in the <unk> .
This can be very seltsam for a real place , except for the same kind of time , when I was that , that &apos;s a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very <unk> .
Just because the person in this thing thinks that , was that , was a <unk> , or something else .
So , for the way , in the way that you &apos;re talking about , you know , in the way that you &apos;re talking about , you have a <unk> <unk> , and you have a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> .
One of the things that really is , is real , because of the perception of the <unk> .
Um sicherzustellen , dass wir einander verstehen , möchte ich Ihnen einen very simple <unk> zu geben .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a very difficult problem for the 50 percent of the 50 children .
I made it out of the <unk> in the <unk> in the 1970s .
I &apos;m going to do the same thing , and I just gave it out .
And then I got out of that , just like I was here .
That &apos;s how he has been .
And so , the <unk> , the way you ever saw , my right ?
I &apos;m going to try to fit the <unk> in the way I &apos;m going to hold on .
I &apos;m going to have a lot of <unk> .
And he , in fact , he , in my Ärmel , I &apos;m not going to be in my Ärmel , I &apos;m going to put up in my <unk> .
So , you know , he doesn &apos;t have a movement .
So I kind of lived there , he can &apos;t walk in and out of my Ärmel .
It &apos;s very simple .
I got my wife and I , hoffentlich , is , when it &apos;s okay , I &apos;m going to be able to make the <unk> that I &apos;m going to love the <unk> .
And so , the fact is that , in fact , in fact , that I &apos;m going to be able to put on the ground , and so I can put on the way that it &apos;s not auf the ground .
No one in my Ärmel , no Täuschung .
<unk> !
And this particular particular day , very young kids , who , in <unk> , will be interested in <unk> , because , you know , you can get a lot of <unk> in the <unk> .
So , even though that &apos;s very simple , very simple .
And so many of you know , many of you know of this particular thing .
That &apos;s how he has been .
I am wearing the <unk> in my hand .
I said , I &apos;m going to tell you my Handgelenk , and so on and out of my Ärmel .
That &apos;s lied .
The way I &apos;m going to show my Handgelenk is because there &apos;s the secret of Illusion .
In the moment , when my right hand , my son , <unk> , bewege my <unk> out of a place in the way that it &apos;s going to be so <unk> .
&quot; Nice girl . &quot; One of the things that you don &apos;t have , in the back .
So that &apos;s how it works .
And when I got up , I got my Finger .
We can tell you why this was <unk> , warum you don &apos;t realize that he &apos;s lying down here .
This is because the Gehirns , in a way , in a way , at a way , is not one , two , three , two , but <unk> .
But that &apos;s not real .
You know , the fact is that the fact is not by the Magnetismus , but by Täuschung , by the way , by the way , I &apos;m going through my <unk> .
And when I did my right hand , that .
And then , when I got back to this , this is where I &apos;m going to get my Finger back in the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get rid of the <unk> .
You know , a very nice little girl , and a lot of your family can do .
Well , was can this with <unk> ?
About a year ago , I had a shot at the <unk> , and I had a very proud <unk> .
I &apos;m not a Wissenschaftler , also , for me , what was amazing .
It turns out that , when you put a Placebo in the place of a weißen <unk> Pille , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> effect .
<unk> as the <unk> , in a smaller Pille , and in a smaller Pille , and in a very short <unk> , and in the same text , is the <unk> messbar effektiver .
We don &apos;t have any of those same <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
But a weißen Pille is not as good as an Blau .
And so I didn ’ t have the <unk> .
But for example , it &apos;s still <unk> .
So , in fact , there is , in fact , in the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
We have a very active opening , the gray one , the other way in the other way , is to be a weißen .
<unk> spielt Rolle .
Now , the fact is that no way , no very much less than three times , I &apos;m not going to try to get the case for the second , I &apos;m not going to be thinking , sorry .
But the case is ...
<unk> spielen .
And this is a kind of <unk> .
And for the ultimativen <unk> , there are the <unk> .
Yeah , right ? One of the <unk> with a couple of <unk> with a group of <unk> , in a <unk> , in a <unk> , in a single <unk> .
This is a huge amount of power in the <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of paint , the very <unk> Pille .
And then , at the same time , at the same time , you have a Graphik , when you &apos;re <unk> .
The point is that the weißen Pille is not as good as the only thing that the Kapsel is , is not as good as the <unk> .
And you don &apos;t have a real <unk> <unk> .
You know , right now , you know , it &apos;s real in your body , and you have a <unk> Effekt .
I wanted to look at the <unk> in a way .
I thought , well , I wanted to get a lot of the real Trick in the way that it &apos;s real .
We all know about the fact that , when the real world comes to the <unk> .
This is a <unk> of fast 18 cm .
I &apos;m going to be a little <unk> here .
This is really my Fleisch . This is not a particularly <unk> <unk> .
This is my Haut . This is not a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get rid of the <unk> and the <unk> by my Arm , I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
So , when they were <unk> <unk> or so on the very <unk> -- I took a couple of minutes for a few Freunde , and so , for a few seconds , I didn &apos;t know .
The way she did was that , for a way , she was taken .
So , I think , when you &apos;re <unk> , you know , when you &apos;re <unk> , you know , I was the first <unk> .
So , you know , but <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> .
That &apos;s how he has been .
On my arm , I &apos;m going to get a small Loch .
Sorry , you know , do this <unk> ?
So , in my sense , I &apos;m going to get a little bit in the way that in the other way .
So , in the same condition , in the same condition , in the same way .
<unk> .
But can you have my Finger right now , right ?
I &apos;ll show you . Here , two , three , four , five .
Yeah ...
I think the way people think about it .
They think , &quot; There &apos;s certainly not blöd genug for a few Minuten of entertainment for a few Minuten of entertainment . &quot; Let me give you a <unk> .
So , you know , right ? It &apos;s right .
Yeah , I &apos;m sure . The one in this room says , &quot; Okay , so I &apos;m not real . &quot;
Let me show you this in a way .
This is real my way . This is not the Hollywood <unk> .
This is my Fleisch . I can put the pin .
Sorry . When it gets you too much , and not in the way .
Every one of the times in the back of the year , when the Bildern was asked to say , &quot; Well , this sieht so aus , and when it comes to the real <unk> , but when it &apos;s real , there &apos;s a Loch and there , if it würde , falls it real , there &apos;s a <unk> for you . &quot; Lassen Sie mich , I can do this a very Blut .
Yeah , there &apos;s it .
At the same time , I &apos;ll tell you the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be able to make my Arm <unk> , and I &apos;m showing you no substance .
But in the same way , and with the idea of something that really doesn &apos;t seem to be like , and so I &apos;m going to have the Nadel in the way that I &apos;m wearing the <unk> .
In this case , I am a couple of years ago , I &apos;ve got a couple more of it .
And so , you &apos;re going to start out here . Thank you very much .
I have a lot of a lot in my life .
I have only two of them .
The first one that , in a very strict <unk> .
It &apos;s a very nice , very , very , very , very good , white , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
This was a fish .
<unk> , the <unk> for the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of Nachhaltigkeit .
So , you know , how do you get a gut positive ?
I &apos;m going to give you a relationship between the very few Monate .
One year , the head of the <unk> and bat , I wanted to talk to you an event in the <unk> of the <unk> .
&quot; Absolutely . &quot;
So here , there &apos;s a kind of a kind of <unk> that was going on in the way that the most beautiful people in terms of the <unk> .
You know , how do we do that ?
In the last 50 years , in the same 50 years , we have <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not very much of the <unk> .
In fact , 90 percent of the big ones , who , in order to take the probe , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they are <unk> .
It &apos;s not about it .
So , so , as good , egal , wie schlimm , <unk> , <unk> , has been a Teil unserer Zukunft .
And so he had a lot of <unk> .
<unk> verschmutzen , the meisten ones of them , they are <unk> , they are <unk> .
<unk> .
It &apos;s about 15 to one .
And that &apos;s how he was going to be 15 billion years ago , for a bigger scale , a bigger scale .
Not very nachhaltig .
And so it &apos;s not very good .
So here , there are a kind of company that he saw in the way that he did .
I wanted them to raise them .
Let me show you the <unk> of the <unk> .
Let &apos;s call them .
&quot; Don &apos;t &quot; , I said , &quot; Um all the Fakten hell out in the sea , you know , so far in the sea , you know , so much in the ocean . &quot;
&quot; The right thing . &quot;
And so , in a way , they said , &quot; Well , in fact , it &apos;s a <unk> .
The <unk> ? 2.5 one , say , &quot; <unk> in the <unk> . &quot;
2.5 one , amazing .
&quot; 2.5 , for 1 was ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> Proteinen . &quot;
&quot; Great . &quot; I said . And I set up the phone .
And the Nachts lag I was in Bett and thought , well , was do a nachhaltiges Protein ?
That am nächsten Tag , I didn &apos;t mention .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about <unk> ? &quot;
There , there &apos;s no way . There was no way .
So I &apos;m going to stand a couple of people in the <unk> .
No , no , no , no .
I happened to get the <unk> in the <unk> .
Let &apos;s go .
I said , &quot; Well , what are some Beispiele for <unk> ? &quot;
Well , there &apos;s a couple of <unk> , and a couple of <unk> , and then , and then , when there &apos;s <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
We said , &quot; Yeah , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; Welcher Prozentsatz deines <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> , two percent .
&quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent . &quot;
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t know that he was about <unk> ? &quot;
He &apos;s going to be a long <unk> in the following and said , &quot; He &apos;s a lot in the world in the world . &quot;
My love for the fish .
No , no , I don &apos;t want to play a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I mean , I am .
No , I lost my love for the fish , because , I &apos;m going to get out of the conversation , the <unk> for Hühnchen , the fish in the <unk> .
The second fish , which is very different .
And so , the romantic ones , the way it &apos;s , is that , in the way that you &apos;re thinking , well , you know , the fish is so much of the fish .
I am going to show you in a <unk> in <unk> .
You know , a <unk> Journalist is about this fish .
They have a way of doing it very much .
And there ’ s a hell of hell , hell , big , big , big , <unk> .
And that was a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a very , very <unk> .
<unk> very , very much .
So , how do you get a fish out of your <unk> ?
I don &apos;t , but I don &apos;t .
Let &apos;s go Miguel .
In fact , it &apos;s Miguel .
And there &apos;s no <unk> . There &apos;s no <unk> .
Zumindest at the way , and I understand .
There &apos;s a Biologe in <unk> La <unk> .
This is a <unk> in the <unk> of Spanien .
Over the <unk> <unk> .
In the 1980ern , the <unk> in the <unk> .
They <unk> , in a very common way .
They did that by the <unk> .
They set up a very komplexen <unk> and <unk> the water from the Land .
They wanted them to do it , not ökonomisch .
And ökologisch , which is a Desaster .
In fact , 90 percent of the Voegel were gone .
And for example , a lot of the Vögeln .
And so , in 1982 , there &apos;s a Spanisch called <unk> <unk> .
Was do they do ?
They did the <unk> .
They were constantly making the <unk> .
Anstatt water out of the water , they used to use the <unk> , they used to carry the <unk> in the water .
They put the <unk> in the water .
They set up a 1,100 Hektar , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and they have a fish , and they have a fish , and they have a fish , and there &apos;s a fish , and there &apos;s a fish that the ökologischer Zerstörung has absolutely <unk> .
The <unk> is fantastic .
I mean , you know , no one &apos;s the way of that .
So , the Horizont of the <unk> is far away , and you &apos;re <unk> all the <unk> Kanäle and the tall , rich , rich Sumpf .
I don &apos;t even know what I &apos;m going to do with Miguel .
There &apos;s a fantastic <unk> , <unk> Charles Darwin and a <unk> <unk> .
Right ? Here are the <unk> by the <unk> , I <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
There &apos;s a seltenen <unk> <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s an <unk> of the very <unk> .
And here , there &apos;s a <unk> that you &apos;re thinking about the <unk> <unk> .
So , you know , Miguel in the world &apos;s Karriere in the <unk> Park in Africa .
I wondered , wie there &apos;s been going to the <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ? I don &apos;t know of the fish .
I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot;
And then , you know , in this way , so in this way , about seltenen Vögeln and <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t understand , it &apos;s really faszinierend , it &apos;s really faszinierend , a Art biologischer society .
I mean , it &apos;s amazing , but I &apos;m bringing things in .
And my <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , die I am at the stage .
And so I gave him a way . I said , &quot; Miguel , so how do we so much ? &quot;
There was an <unk> .
&quot; I understand , the <unk> , the <unk> , the family , the <unk> .
But was that food ?
What is the <unk> ? &quot;
And then , when I was going to tell you , dass es so a rich System , so that the Fischen was in the wild essen .
And the <unk> , the Phytoplankton , the <unk> Plankton , that &apos;s the case of the <unk> .
The System is so gesund , so it &apos;s absolutely <unk> .
He &apos;s not <unk> .
One of the <unk> you don &apos;t have any of the resources ?
I &apos;m going to talk to you , I &apos;m going to start with a walk in the middle and bat that , I said , &quot; Well , for a place , I said , &quot; You know , for a place , I think , &quot; <unk> , in the way I &apos;m going to show you ? &quot;
In the same way , when it &apos;s kind of a <unk> <unk> .
And we walked out of it , and this was very amazing , tausende and Abertausende pink <unk> , in a very pink Teppich , very pink Teppich .
&quot; That &apos;s the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Look at the <unk> , pink .
They are <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? I am totally <unk> .
I said , &quot; Miguel , are they not going to be an <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah ! &quot;
&quot; We 20 Prozent unserer Fische and <unk> for the sun . &quot;
Last year , there were 600,000 Vögel , more than 250 individuals .
In fact , it &apos;s the largest and one of the wichtigsten private <unk> in Europe . &quot;
I said , &quot; Miguel , well , do you know that , who can &apos;t be the <unk> , who will man an <unk> ? &quot;
There ’ d not be <unk> .
We said , &quot; We <unk> <unk> , not very intensiv .
This is a ökologischer Netzwerk .
The <unk> of the <unk> .
The Garnelen food actually eats the very <unk> .
So , you know , you know , <unk> the <unk> , which means the same System . &quot;
Okay , let &apos;s go back to that .
One of the <unk> , who is not a single solution , and a <unk> , who are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , but a <unk> .
Oh , so , the <unk> , the <unk> , who can &apos;t be here .
In a tiny square kilometer , in a small Kilometern area , in a small way , in the <unk> .
Every morning , they Fliegen 250 miles in the <unk> .
And every time they Fliegen 250 miles .
They do that , because they can do the raw material of the domestic <unk> .
No Scherz .
I used to show up a <unk> , and I looked at Miguel .
I said , &quot; Miguel , do they Fliegen 250 miles an hour in the <unk> and at 250 miles ? &quot;
<unk> that for that ? &quot;
And so , when I was looking at the Whitney <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s no . You know , they can do that , in the way that they &apos;re doing food . &quot;
I have the <unk> of my own , which I don &apos;t mention , which is amazing , and I am not <unk> .
I don &apos;t care about it . I don &apos;t know he <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> Geschmack .
I didn &apos;t make it very much .
But when I got out in the <unk> in the <unk> , we didn &apos;t get it in <unk> .
There &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , if you took a breath from the Ozean .
I said , you know , at the Miguel and <unk> .
We said , &quot; The <unk> works as a <unk> .
It &apos;s the way that it &apos;s going to be the very <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s a spread to the <unk> . &quot;
And then , in addition , there were no <unk> .
Okay . One of the <unk> that has not taken .
One of the <unk> , which has come out of your own lack of <unk> .
And then , when there &apos;s a <unk> , the <unk> that has no <unk> , so there &apos;s a huge <unk> , because the water has been made by the <unk> in the <unk> .
This is a Fluss of all the <unk> , the most likely that they tend to <unk> , chemical <unk> , <unk> .
And so , when they are out of the <unk> and <unk> , the water has fallen in the same way .
This System is so gesund , so that it &apos;s the water <unk> .
So , not only the <unk> that they don &apos;t don &apos;t have a single <unk> , no <unk> that they have to reach out of the world , but a <unk> , who are <unk> at the <unk> .
And not only for the Fischen , but for me .
Because when the water breaks down , it &apos;s in the Atlantic Ocean .
I &apos;m going to take a very much one in the water , I &apos;m thinking , well , I &apos;m going to do it , and so , and so on , I can do this , because the <unk> , which romantic , is <unk> .
You can say that it &apos;s a Rezept for the case of good Nahrung , oder wir sprechen über <unk> oder Rinder .
Because , you know , that was a <unk> <unk> , one in the way that the Nahrung is really good .
But for a lot of the people who are radikal .
We don &apos;t have <unk> ; we <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We lieben <unk> .
We take small <unk> .
We talk about local food .
We &apos;re organic .
And then , when you think that this was the case of all the way that all of you are paying attention to and say , &quot; Hey , I &apos;m supposed to be <unk> <unk> , and you say , &quot; Hey , I am <unk> <unk> <unk> , but how do we feed it ?
You know how to feed the world ? &quot;
I mean , I &apos;m fair ?
I don &apos;t care about that .
No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
One million people have been talking to it today .
One billion -- that &apos;s more than that -- because of the huge amount of inequality , not the way .
I don &apos;t really care about the fact of the Logik unseres <unk> in the last 50 years .
<unk> Getreide , for example , in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the whole <unk> of the <unk> , and the whole <unk> of the <unk> said , &quot; You know , when you feed your own <unk> ? &quot;
And that &apos;s the <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> .
The U.S . Army war <unk> .
And then , when we were there , there was a set of <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> , which has a place in <unk> <unk> , so the cost of <unk> the <unk> .
And that &apos;s not a job and it &apos;s not <unk> .
In fact , it has been fighting in the world , not by the <unk> , but by <unk> <unk> , not by the <unk> <unk> , not by the <unk> and <unk> , but in <unk> , not by <unk> , but in <unk> , not by the <unk> and nice , but in the water , and not by the <unk> and nice and nice , but in the water .
Willst du <unk> ?
Let &apos;s start with the question : What are you going to do ?
Or , in the way , in the way that we set out to set out food , where do we manage to feed your own choices ?
At the same time , not for the <unk> for the day .
It &apos;s alt and it &apos;s <unk> .
It has a huge amount of money , Chemikalien and <unk> , and so it &apos;s not a very good thing for us .
Just in the right <unk> .
This is the black one in two billion years of life .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> who aren &apos;t <unk> , <unk> who <unk> the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> , who aren &apos;t very <unk> , but <unk> in Beziehungen , because they &apos;re all <unk> in schmecken .
And as I &apos;m very , very fair , they are a besserer Koch , if I got to you .
So , I think I &apos;m okay , I think , because when the case of good is , it &apos;s going to be fine .
Vielen Dank .
I grew up at a constant heart of Science .
In the <unk> , I went to the Bus in the middle of the Bus , a Stunde of a day .
And I mean , I mean , I &apos;m going to get through a very , very , very <unk> magazine , so I think in Gedanken , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , and that , in <unk> , my <unk> &apos;s Neugier .
And so , the Neugierde <unk> , in the way I don &apos;t , when I don &apos;t , in the classroom , I am in the <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , Schlangen , and <unk> , and it took them out of the <unk> .
You know , I mean , I mean , I &apos;m a real <unk> .
But it was all of the way in the world , the Grenzen of the <unk> .
And I think of Liebe for Science Fiction , as in the World Trade Center , I think , because , was that he , in the way that he was in the späten <unk> , we walked in the <unk> , and Jacques Cousteau in the world , Jacques Cousteau , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , who were unable to imagine .
This is what was happening to the very , very <unk> <unk> .
And I think a doctor .
I &apos;d wake up . I &apos;d wake up .
And so he didn &apos;t have a video of the <unk> and all the <unk> of <unk> Filmen and all these photographs in the Medienlandschaft , and then I got the scene in the <unk> .
Well , you know , all of the sudden , when we were going to hear a very good one , and then , at the end of the sentence , and then , at the scene , the Beschreibung of the <unk> , in the <unk> .
And so , I think , when I set up , I Malen , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all of these things .
I went through <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
And so , that &apos;s the kind of girl who was a Ausweg .
And he was very interesting to me , Jacques Cousteau &apos;s hands , and they were very excited about the fact that he , in fact , in the fact that he in the world .
I think there &apos;s no way in a living world in a solar Raumschiff .
This is very <unk> .
But here , what I &apos;m going to do , in this way , in the way I &apos;m going to be able to go down here , the way so rich and exotic , which was so rich , as all I was going to get out of the books in the way that I was going to play out of the books .
So , I am able to have a Taucher in 15 <unk> .
And the only way that , in a small reef in Kanada , I live in a small Dorf in Canada , 600 miles am year .
But I didn &apos;t get through <unk> .
I &apos;m going to take a chance in a minute , bis es endlich an <unk> in Buffalo , New York , in Buffalo , New York , kurz over the place where we were living .
And I took a sign in a <unk> , in a <unk> , in the Winter , in Buffalo , New York .
And I saw the Ozean , a real Ozean , no two years later , when we were in California .
In the <unk> 40 years , I am about 3,000 Stunden in the middle of the ocean , and 500 Stunden , in <unk> .
And I have been able to get in the wild environment , and in fact , the flachen Ozeanen , so so rich , so reich , so rich are living in the world .
The <unk> of the Natur is so <unk> , in the very small , very common way .
In the same way , I have a big bet for this in the water .
And there ’ n <unk> Liebe for the Ozean of the Ozean so much more than them .
But when I was a kid , when I was going to remind you , which led to the <unk> .
And so , for the best way , that I had to tell you , um Geschichten zu erzählen , mit denen , mit denen ich <unk> , um an image zu schaffen , um an image zu erschaffen .
And as a kid , I was very excited about <unk> , etc .
I mean , movies and Erzählungen together and Erzählungen together . And so , very good .
And they were natürlich the stories that I noticed , Science Fiction , &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; The <unk> &quot; .
And with &quot; The <unk> &quot; , I &apos;m going to give up Liebe for the <unk> and in a <unk> .
<unk> , the two Leidenschaften .
There was a very interesting one in &quot; The <unk> &quot; , that , in a very profound way , in the movie , in the movie , and in a way , in a form of flüssiges , <unk> , <unk> .
And this <unk> in the first soft <unk> , <unk> Animation that you &apos;re in a film .
And so , despite the fact that the film has no <unk> , I didn &apos;t even tell you , what was I really worried about was , which was , what was the Publikum , the World Heritage <unk> , what was the World Heritage <unk> , which is what was happening in the <unk> .
Well , you know , it &apos;s Arthur <unk> , so many of you can &apos;t even stand out of it , of course , of <unk> .
And they were really <unk> .
And I was very enthusiastisch .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , so I can think that <unk> can be in the <unk> . &quot;
So , with &quot; <unk> Two &quot; , was my second film , which was a lot in the way .
<unk> with <unk> , and they made the <unk> <unk> in the movie .
And so they did . And so , very , very <unk> .
And we have a very different effect of the child .
And then , you know , for a very , very , very , very much energy back .
So , for the two reasons , in between the two reasons , this is dead , this is a very neuen World , a very neuen world of Kreativität .
So I started a company with <unk> Winston , my guten Freund , my guten Freund , as the most <unk> and <unk> , which was the <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> of the <unk> , which was a Sprung to the analog Prozessen of optical power , and so people and so forth , and so we würden sofort digital <unk> .
And so , you know , and they have , and they gave uns a <unk> Vorteil .
But then , in fact , in the <unk> , in the 90ern , in the 90ern , in the <unk> , in the <unk> and <unk> , for the <unk> .
So I kind of wrote this guy called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which says , &quot; Avatar of all the <unk> &#93; , from <unk> Effekte , who , where realistic menschlichen emotionalen <unk> , in <unk> , and the <unk> , and all the <unk> , and the World Trade Organization , and the <unk> in <unk> and the <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to tell you about the people in a foot , dass wir still not in the way that they were going to do this .
So I set out the same thing in the Kühlschrank and I took the other film in a huge Schiff .
I verkauften that in the Studio , &quot; Romeo and Julia . &quot;
This is a epic romantic , leidenschaftliche film .
I was going to do what I wanted to do , what was going on , I wanted to be the real <unk> of the Titanic .
And that &apos;s why I made the Film .
And that &apos;s the truth . No , the Studio was not .
But I kind of überzeugten them . I said , &quot; We walked in the <unk> . We &apos;re going to get it out .
We &apos;ve got to use it in the <unk> .
It &apos;s a huge scale . It &apos;s a fantastic charge .
I überzeugte that she had a Expedition to volunteer .
<unk> . But this has been very difficult for your Vorstellungskraft by the way for your Vorstellungskraft .
Because , in fact , a true reality in a year , in a russischen U-Boot , two and a half mile , two and a halben mile in the North Atlantic Ocean , schaute to the real Titanic , not a film , not a film , not a film , but real .
And so I am totally <unk> .
And there ’ s a bunch of <unk> , and they can set out the <unk> and the whole thing .
But that &apos;s a lot of the way that all of you have , in the way that we were looking at the ground .
You know , you know , there &apos;s a very low-tech and a half <unk> .
The point in this place is falling in the middle of the dunklen <unk> in the middle of this dunklen environment , where he doesn &apos;t come out of the Hoffnung .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , so I &apos;m going to walk in a Science Fiction <unk> .
This is very cool .
And so , you know , I was able to <unk> the <unk> in the Tiefen Ozean .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> .
It &apos;s what it &apos;s going to do . It &apos;s what kind of <unk> . It &apos;s what kind of <unk> .
Because , you know , I can stand a single person , and I can give you a <unk> , and I can give you a <unk> , and I didn &apos;t even imagine that , was I made up of the painting .
As we did a lot of the same thing in the next couple of these people , and I would have a couple of these things , and I didn &apos;t even think of the way that I hadn &apos;t been in the way that you hadn &apos;t , the way that you hadn &apos;t seen before , who didn &apos;t predict the way in the moment of all the time , and <unk> .
So , what I &apos;m going to do is absolutely <unk> and <unk> .
And so I made a very funny thing .
After all , the Titanic of the Titanic , I said , &quot; OK , I took up a job as Hollywood , and I have a long <unk> , and I &apos;m going to spend a long <unk> . &quot;
And so we started to set up the pages .
And we went to the <unk> , and then <unk> the <unk> .
We went to the <unk> of the Titanic .
We set out small <unk> , and they set out the <unk> .
And the idea is that , in the way , in the way that you were going to do this , and you have an <unk> Forschung , which was done in the first place .
No one in the <unk> of the <unk> . They didn &apos;t have the money to do it , also entwickelten Technologien .
So here , I am the <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> in a U-Boot , and in a U-Boot , in a very large way , in a very large way , in this case , in this case , in the way I was going to know that the band had to play .
And I am a small <unk> of the <unk> .
When I said , I &apos;m going to give you a huge Bewusstsein , I think , in the <unk> , I think , when I was in the <unk> of the Titanic .
And so , the <unk> type of <unk> <unk> that I had to do for a place , and I was going to get all the time in the way that they were going to be out of the <unk> , because I &apos;ll give back a few Monate , in the set of the <unk> , as I am the World Trade <unk> .
And the set of <unk> , which was based on the <unk> .
So , that &apos;s a very profound thing .
And I think that the <unk> Erlebnis , so the real way that you can do this is that , in the <unk> <unk> , in the middle of your body , in the other condition , in the <unk> .
It &apos;s really <unk> .
And a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very <unk> , has been in many different ways , in many of these <unk> <unk> , in many cases , in many of these <unk> <unk> .
So , the thing that has happened here , and really , really , really , really , really , really , really , in the deep world , as in the deep world , in the deep world , the amazing amazing fact .
They &apos;re virtually extinct in the world here .
They live in a <unk> .
They don &apos;t know in the <unk> System , so on the way .
And so , the way you &apos;re looking at the right is that , in the way , the way that it &apos;s in terms of 500 <unk> <unk> .
We think they can &apos;t be safe .
At the same time , I &apos;m going to take very much an opportunity in <unk> , so the Science Fiction , in the way Science , the way it works .
And I &apos;m going to start in the <unk> , very <unk> , <unk> NASA , <unk> , real <unk> , I went to Russland , and I went to Russland , I went to the <unk> biomedizinischen <unk> and all the kinds of things , in the middle of the Sahara , in the <unk> , in the <unk> .
And that &apos;s what was amazing .
But that was a huge scale , so I was a lot of the people in the middle .
And they were going to get out of the <unk> , the <unk> Wissenschaftlern , the <unk> , the people who were going to take over the extreme distances , and they were going to be out in the <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> and <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> and <unk> .
So here , there were a similar film to this , but in fact , this was a very , very , very , very <unk> .
I had the Kreis to come out of the Science Fiction , you know , well , you know , as a way , and all of this can do .
And so , you know , in the way that night , I got a lot of <unk> .
And I was a lot of the art of Wissenschaft . But I lernte a lot of <unk> .
Now , you know , a <unk> , a <unk> , unfortunately , that , of course , , Captain of the Schiff and so on .
I didn &apos;t know about <unk> , or I didn &apos;t know about .
Because I said , &quot; Was do I was here ?
Why do I do this ? What I &apos;m going to do ? &quot;
We don &apos;t know that they &apos;re living with the <unk> .
They don &apos;t have <unk> . It &apos;s not a <unk> .
People think that I was going to have fallen from &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; am Strand .
I have all these Filme , all of these <unk> , for a very , very <unk> Publikum .
No <unk> , no hope , no Geld . Was do you ?
You can do it for the work for the work , and the Ozean is the most <unk> Umfeld that he has , for the excitement of the <unk> , and for a very , very important bond , a small group of people in common .
Because all of these things were made by the <unk> for the <unk> .
In the middle of the year , for a long time , for a piece .
And by the end , you know , the <unk> , the <unk> Respekt that you have for them , and that , for you know , will man , dass man eine Aufgabe hat , and , you know , dass man eine Aufgabe hat , who man nicht erklären kann .
After all , when they come out and they said , &quot; We can do this and the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and that and that , all of the technology , and that , all of the technology , the menschlichen effects of all the way out of the work , das kann man nicht erklären . &quot;
And so , this is a bond , a Band of Respekt .
As I took back to the next film that I took up at the same way that the &quot; Avatar &quot; was going to work at the same kind of <unk> , which is , was that man will respektiert your Team , and she deserves a chance to support her Respekt .
And so , really , the power of the Dynamik .
So , in a very small Team , I &apos;m going to bring up a small number of things , &quot; Avatar . &quot;
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to have a Familie , in the four and a halben system .
And I didn &apos;t think that I was making Filme .
So , you have a chance of having <unk> , so the Ozean of the Ozean , and then you put on the outside Pandora .
For me , what was happening in the same way , the Prozess of all the time , the Prozess that was going on .
So , was can you get out ?
Well , was there a <unk> ?
Now , I think a lot of a girl .
It &apos;s the mächtigsten person , it &apos;s got to be the power .
<unk> is the real power that you can do right now .
And the <unk> of your Team is wichtiger in the world .
And he &apos;s a young lady who come up and say , &quot; Gib me a couple of Rat , and he said , &quot; <unk> , I have a Rat for that . &quot;
And I said , &quot; <unk> &apos;t <unk> .
Other people can do this for you , do not , do not , do not , do not .
And they are <unk> . &quot;
NASA says , &quot; <unk> is not a choice . &quot;
No , <unk> can be on the ground , because it &apos;s a shot in the <unk> .
And you don &apos;t have a huge set of Innovation , which is not a lot of a year .
We &apos;re getting out of the <unk> .
And that &apos;s the idea that I &apos;m going to leave you out in this way , that , in a way , some choices , but not .
Now , when I &apos;m going to tell you a great idea , it &apos;s all around the data , and it &apos;s all the data that we &apos;re using , so the Summe of the <unk> .
Anstatt <unk> , I thought , well , I think , as you can do , so I think , in terms of Information , um <unk> , and Trends , Trends to <unk> and Trends , die sonst unsichtbar bleiben .
This is a typical <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> , I &apos;m able to use a short <unk> .
It &apos;s called <unk> . With <unk> , I &apos;m going to drop out at a single <unk> , in a way .
I &apos;m going to be a very different part of the same second .
This is because here in the Mitte of the <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> .
We can go back to the outside , and for the <unk> .
We see the <unk> and <unk> and Krebs the üblichen Verdächtigen , but not for everybody .
In fact , when we moved out and down at the same time , 40 years ago , 40 years of jünger , you know , there &apos;s been a huge cause of death .
So , when you think about it , you know , the most important thing for people .
So , you know , I think , in this way , in the way that , in the way , in the way , in a lebenden <unk> .
So , when you can do that out there , why can &apos;t you deal with Inhalte ?
And this is the picture of every year of play <unk> that you &apos;re making .
All of you have here . It &apos;s all right .
You can go back to the back , and this is how to get my Talk .
With <unk> , you can zoom in a Jahrzehnt .
You can zoom in a bestimmten <unk> .
You can jump across a third .
So I &apos;m like that . I &apos;m looking at the Athleten who are in the <unk> .
I &apos;m like to tell you about <unk> Armstrong , and so on , I kind of pulled out , and I have all of these concepts , in the <unk> Armstrong .
As soon as I &apos;m going to look down at the end , I think , &quot; Why not all that <unk> ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to get a job in that .
I &apos;m looking at Greg <unk> .
So , you know , when you think about it , you know , in the way that it &apos;s <unk> , smaller and <unk> , in and out of it , you don &apos;t have to do it .
You know , it &apos;s very different .
And he &apos;s in between , and they &apos;re thinking , well , you know , you know , you can use the information .
I &apos;m going to kind of <unk> it , a little <unk> .
So here we have an image of Wikipedia , and we have a small patch of <unk> .
This is a small patch of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , um an <unk> teilzunehmen .
I &apos;m going to show you the top 500 beliebtesten <unk> .
But in this very small way , you can do very much .
We have to have a clue of all the Themen of Themen , who are <unk> on Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to move around and do government .
I &apos;ve been going to the U.S . Regierung , I think that the <unk> that was most likely that people in the first year of the year .
Now , this is very , very wichtig , because the <unk> were in none of the separate <unk> .
So , you can get out of a Schritt , and you can all have an <unk> and all the way .
So , when I was in one of the <unk> , I found tiefer in the back of Time Magazine in the Time Magazine , and all of the time for all the time .
One of all , all of these people all over all of these people in the face of Politik .
And some of the <unk> .
A very small part of the Geschäftswelt .
This is my Chef .
One of the <unk> .
The interesting thing is that Bono is a TED <unk> .
We can also jump to all the TED Talks .
So , in the same way , in the same way , when it comes to the Web , when it &apos;s real , it &apos;s a Web , not an image to stand out to the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show you another one else , I &apos;ll have a different set of <unk> .
Let me show you the New York Times .
<unk> , the service -- I &apos;m not calling a Browser , it &apos;s not a Browser . It &apos;s not a Browser , but they &apos;re going to turn out to the <unk> -- we can bring down the <unk> for every shot .
I &apos;m going to get a shot in a straight line , right , right in a certain place .
And the way that this is , is that I &apos;m going to ask you all the way out in the way that I &apos;m going to look at the same way in the same way in the same way .
I &apos;d ever been in a very difficult way of doing this in certain moments .
So here &apos;s the <unk> I have .
I can do some of my work at the same time .
When I got a little <unk> and everything in my life , I can control my <unk> <unk> .
So here , I did a couple of <unk> Forschung , I went to Bing , and there were Live Labs <unk> .
And I think of that out of the way that I found out in this way , and she &apos;s going to start out .
It &apos;s a kind of Metapher that happens every single time , and every time it &apos;s all the same time in the middle of all the microbes in the world .
Today , in our world , we have a <unk> , right ?
We have about the <unk> <unk> Information .
We have in terms of <unk> .
At the same time , when you can put it in the same way , and the Web at the same time , in the same way that , in the same one , we can uns an extra thing in the back , and so we can get a lot of things in a very different way , and so the Mustern können , and so the Mustern spielen können .
If you can do this , you can &apos;t get it in the same way , you can get out of it .
In order to go out of the information , he can get out of <unk> .
As you know , he knows , well , he might be <unk> .
Thank you very much .
We have a lot of talk about Glück .
And I have a couple of these Bücher , in the letzten five Jahren , in the letzten five Jahren , in the <unk> , and so on , and so on , and so on , there were a very <unk> .
He &apos;s a lot of exciting , for a lot of young .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
The way we &apos;re doing is to make people glücklicher .
But in fact , the power of the power is a very different heart disease that makes you feel less or less positive to hope .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you about the kognitiven <unk> .
All of the sudden , the ordinary people who are thinking about their own Zufriedenheit , and so it &apos;s true for all of the people who are thinking about Glück , because it &apos;s so much .
The first reaction is that , in the <unk> , in order to make Komplexität .
And so , when it comes to that , it doesn &apos;t get a positive Wort in the way that you &apos;re doing so much .
I think he was a bestimmten white person , but all of it , but for all of you , it was that you can aufgeben , and you can akzeptieren the <unk> Vision , an <unk> Vision von <unk> .
The second case is that the <unk> of Erfahrung is that , in the way , in the middle of it , in the middle of it , in your Leben and glücklich , über your Leben and glücklich are über your Leben .
And that &apos;s two totally different kinds of things that are made up of a lot of <unk> .
And the third pitch is the Illusion of konzentrieren and the unglücklichen Umstand , dass wir nicht an der richtigen Stelle an der richtigen Stelle , ohne an impact on the impact on the planet .
I mean , this is a kognitiven decline .
He doesn &apos;t have a certain way of getting it .
Now , I &apos;ll start with a single case of jemandem , der in a <unk> and <unk> , in a von a meiner Vorträgen .
And this is what the story of the story .
And there , there &apos;s an object in a <unk> , and so it &apos;s all fantastic Musik , and this fantastic Musik , which and am Ende of the Aufnahme , what he &apos;s going to do is a schreckliches Geräusch .
And then , you know , really , really , really , really , really , really , all of these kinds of things were happening .
But that &apos;s not true .
There was a clue to the future .
There was this kind of Erlebnis .
And there &apos;s a fantastic role in there .
They were no longer <unk> , because there &apos;s an opportunity to stand out of it ; this idea , and that &apos;s what was happening , and that &apos;s what was going on , and that &apos;s what was happening .
And so , this was one of the <unk> that we &apos;re going to do , and others , two individuals .
He &apos;s a <unk> I have in the Gegenwart of the Gegenwart and the Gegenwart of the Gegenwart is that in the state of the room , but in real the Gegenwart .
The Arzt is going to be dead , dead , when the Arzt said , &quot; Is that when the Arzt says , &quot; <unk> , when I &apos;m here <unk> ? &quot;
And then he , and I am the <unk> , and the <unk> I was the <unk> and the story of all unseres Lebens , and so on , and so on , the person in the way that fragt : &quot; Woher are you denn ? &quot;
of &quot; You know , &quot; or &quot; You know , &quot; or so .
This is two very different things , and I am the <unk> and the <unk> I and the <unk> in between both the <unk> and the <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s a <unk> .
And so , really , really , really , really , really , in fact , of all the time of our Erinnerungen , it starts unmittelbar .
We don &apos;t tell the story of all the time , when they Geschichten all the time .
And so , in fact , the information tells us , who said , &quot; Well , was can tell you , all of you can run away from all unserer Erfahrungen .
And I &apos;m going to start with a couple of <unk> .
This is a very typical shot .
And so that &apos;s the real time that they have a <unk> Eingriff .
I <unk> all the Details . This is not very <unk> , but it &apos;s very schmerzhaft in the &apos; 90s in the 90er .
They mussten every 60 Sekunden to take over ihren <unk> .
And that &apos;s two Patienten .
This is our <unk> .
And he said , &quot; How much of you can have a chance ? &quot;
And that &apos;s a very nice person .
So , you know , the chance of having a chance of having the chance of the <unk> .
And there &apos;s a long time there , and for every minute , and for every minute , the Patient , the Patienten , the Patienten of the day , you have to have a long <unk> .
But here &apos;s a different question : how many Schmerzen think these Patienten are ?
And I think that makes a sense that the Patient is a very mild Gedächtnis for the <unk> of the <unk> .
And the stories of the <unk> <unk> , because a very wichtigen Abschnitt of all the time -- and none of the stories of the story is very inspirierend oder genial -- but one davon ist sehr inspirierend .
And the real thing that happens is that , in the way that happens , that &apos;s the way that happens in the way that happens in the <unk> .
This is a <unk> story .
You know , how do you know ? Because we asked all these people to <unk> the <unk> , and so much später , &quot; You know , &quot; So , &quot; You know , how much ? &quot;
And so , for a long way , for B , in the way B , in the way it &apos;s .
Well , this is a straight Konflikt zwischen the <unk> and the <unk> .
And I think of the viewer in the <unk> , I can get B very <unk> .
Well , was that you can do with a <unk> A , and we have clinical trials , and so it can happen , and so it can happen , and so it can , ever , the <unk> of the <unk> from the Röhre in the very <unk> .
And so , that can give you a chance of Schmerzen , but not many , many very , very much less .
And so , for a couple of minutes , for a few minutes , you know , for the <unk> I made of a <unk> A in the <unk> , and so I made a very different way from Patienten A , weil der Patient A so <unk> , weil der Patient eine bessere Geschichte hat .
What do you know ?
And so , for the fact , for all the time , for all the time , and it &apos;s an image for all the stories that wir erfinden .
I mean , this is a story of all the time , difficult times and <unk> .
<unk> are very , very wichtige , and in this Fall , which was the <unk> .
Well , I &apos;m sure that I &apos;m living there are constantly living .
There &apos;s certain kinds of things in the future .
And do you ask : was can he in this moment ?
And the fact is very simple .
They are lost forever .
I mean , the meisten times unseres Lebens -- I &apos;ve got the <unk> -- well , the psychological right dauert about three Minuten , saying that , you know .
This is , well , you know , in a minute , in a minute , you have 600 Millionen .
In a Monat , he &apos;s about 600,000 .
We don &apos;t have a <unk> .
Over the best , I don &apos;t have a lot of attention from the <unk> .
And yet , you know , one of the more or more of the way that falls , will man , dass all diese <unk> , was that all dies in the <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> Ressource that we <unk> , but it &apos;s the <unk> .
And so , you know , so it &apos;s important to be relevant , but I don &apos;t have the same thing that I &apos;m going to spend for you .
So , I have a lot of it , and I am the <unk> and the <unk> I &apos;m going to be very different .
The real Unterschied in the same way that they &apos;re in the <unk> .
In the same way , I &apos;m going to tell you a Urlaub one in the morning , and the second one in the morning , so the only one in the two Wochen in the morning is zweimal so gut wie the Urlaub one in the morning .
So , I don &apos;t think for the <unk> .
At the end of the day , I &apos;m going to give you a Urlaub in two Wochen in the morning for the Ferien einer Woche , weil he keine neuen Erinnerungen <unk> .
You don &apos;t have to have the history .
And so , in the way , the critical variable I did is that I unterscheidet all of the variable I took from .
Over the course of the story .
And I think I am thinking about it , and I was an image of all the time and Erzählungen .
It &apos;s the person who takes them Entscheidungen , when they have a Patienten , and they have two <unk> in between two different Chirurgen and so on entscheiden , and entscheiden entscheiden , welche to do that , for the least of a very good idea , and that &apos;s the Chirurg , the <unk> , and that &apos;s the Chirurg , den er will .
And I don &apos;t have the word in the choices .
We don &apos;t have to move on .
We can move back to the experience of an experience . <unk> , and , right , when we think in the morning , they don &apos;t even think in the future .
We think of all the time as an instant injury .
And so , ever , in the way that , when a Diktatur , I think , as a Diktatur , I &apos;m like the <unk> , and the <unk> , I think , like the <unk> , I am a very <unk> Erlebnis , das ich nicht brauche , so I am the very <unk> , dass , wenn wir so Urlaub nehmen , dass es im Urlaub ist , um an Urlaub zu machen , so in Urlaub , so in Urlaub , so in Urlaub for the <unk> .
And that &apos;s very schwierig , I think .
I mean , how much do we use it ?
This is one of the Erklärungen bias that falls of the <unk> , I think .
And I think , when I thought I was thinking about some very Urlaub in the same way in the Antarktis , and I think , well , in the Antarktis , and I think he very , very much for the other <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to find all my time in the Urlaub for three Minuten in the morning for about 25 Minuten .
Now , when I had a lot of the <unk> , I had a long <unk> , I &apos;ll give you a little more Stunden .
This is also three Wochen , and that &apos;s a fast 80 Stunden .
He seems to be a <unk> .
Well , maybe I am a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , dass wir so much an average an an Erinnerungen beteiligt haben , mit denen wir an Erfahrungen arbeiten ?
So I &apos;m going to talk about a <unk> .
At the same time , you &apos;re going to be able to all den Urlaub out on the edge of all the <unk> , and so on a Pille , and so on a Pille , and so on , dass man nichts mehr erinnern kann .
If you &apos;re going to do the same Urlaub ? And then , when you &apos;re a different <unk> , he würde a Konflikt zwischen the two <unk> .
And man muss darüber nachdenken , wie man diesen Konflikt löst .
And so , that &apos;s not as if you think about it , when you think in terms of time , you can have a single letter .
And when you think about it , you can have a different set of people .
And so , for example , the <unk> wählen that we &apos;re going to wählen , is that , in a way , in the Zwei <unk> .
In fact , the two <unk> of happiness are going to be true of happiness .
It &apos;s true that he can have two types of Zufriedenheit künstlich , one I can do .
So , you can ask : So , what am I going to do is that I am <unk> ?
And then you can ask : how many times are you in the Lebens of the <unk> ?
And they &apos;re all -- the Glück is a very komplizierten Prozess .
What are the Emotionen of the <unk> ?
So , in fact , there are a very good idea in the way that I &apos;m going to have a very good idea of all the Glücks in the morning .
So , when you think about the Glück , I &apos;m a total different <unk> .
This is not a way of looking at anybody .
And so , when you talk about it , you know , when you &apos;re an average person , you &apos;re thinking about it .
<unk> very different .
All of the sudden , all of those Konzepte in a couple of occasions , and I &apos;m going to give you a <unk> <unk> of the Glück , and I <unk> bis zu einer <unk> for a couple of years of all the time , and for a very , very long <unk> of all the way .
And so the Unterschied of the Glück of the Glück I and the Erfüllung des <unk> at the <unk> , and he also <unk> the two separate <unk> , and he also , for the fact , the two separate lines , the Gallup Organization has a global disease , in the <unk> , in der mehr als eine halbe Million Leute , and so on .
And he took over the same way in the same way .
In the letzten paar Jahren , in the middle of the Glück , in the Glück of the U.S .
And the most amazing guy , who , I think , is , I think , is the real difference .
You know , you know , you know , you know , when you &apos;re born , and you know , you know , you know , very wenig darüber , wie glücklich , so glücklich , so glücklich , so glücklich .
So , for the Zufall , the relative Zufall , that Zufall is about 0.5 .
And so , when you think that , when you think , when you &apos;re born and you &apos;re saying , well , you know , this was a mile 80 , where you &apos;re going to be a Meter 80 ?
You know , it &apos;s about all of you , but he &apos;s a lot of Unsicherheit .
So , so far , so I have a lot of Unsicherheit , when I was telling you that , you know , someone in the middle of 10 , so much of 10 , so you have a lot of Unsicherheit , so you have a lot of Unsicherheit darüber , wie glücklich sie sind .
And so the mate is schwach .
We know about that , I know , in a very positive way .
We know , the money is very , very , very wichtig , Ziele and so on .
In fact , if you know Glück , people are happy with people , mit denen , mit denen wir , mit Leuten , mit denen wir uns auseinandersetzen können .
He &apos;s got a different <unk> , but that &apos;s got up .
So , when you &apos;re living out of the way that you &apos;re going to maximieren , it will be a very different way of saving it very , very different .
And the conclusion was that , in the way I said that , dass Glück real people aren &apos;t considered a <unk> .
It &apos;s a very different <unk> .
And so , very schnell -- another talk , warum wir nicht an Glück <unk> -- dass wir nicht an so much Glück suchen , wenn wir über das Leben nachdenken .
So , when you ask the very simple person in California , you don &apos;t have to get the right person in California .
When the people think that they &apos;re glücklicher in California , when they &apos;re <unk> in a <unk> in Ohio .
And so , when they think in California in California , they think about the <unk> in California and other people in the same room , in the same case , in the same way .
It turns out that the Klimawandel is not so much for the <unk> I didn &apos;t expect to do that , so I don &apos;t have to do so much , so I don &apos;t know , so glücklich , wie glücklich people are .
But I think that when I was thinking the <unk> that you can do -- dass manche Leute in California in California .
And the interesting thing that he was interested in was , in a way , in Kalifornien , in California , in the <unk> .
Well , the <unk> won &apos;t be glücklicher .
We know .
But one thing he has happened . They think they &apos;re glücklicher , denn , when they think about it , they thought , well , when they think in a way , it &apos;s amazing what was happening in Ohio .
And they thought , well , they made the richtigen <unk> .
It &apos;s very , very schwierig , <unk> über Wohlbefinden , and I hoffe , dass ich Ihnen eine Ahnung habe , so dass ich Ihnen eine Ahnung habe .
Vielen Dank .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you .
Thank you very much .
If we were on a few Wochen on the end of the <unk> , he said , he had a very interesting case of the <unk> .
If you can do this with a couple of minutes ?
Daniel <unk> : Yeah , I think the most interesting Ergebnis in the <unk> is that , at the <unk> , that we &apos;re not supposed to have .
And I think it &apos;s an Glück of the Glück .
So , when you think , when you look at the physical perception of the <unk> ?
In fact , in the $ 60.000 $ 2,000 in a year , for the <unk> , and it &apos;s about a very large group of Amerikaner , in a very , 600 <unk> , a huge degree of <unk> , and a Einkommen in the $ 600,000 $ 2,000 pro year .
CA : 60,000 DK : 60,000 60,000 dollars pro Jahr , they &apos;re unglücklich , and they have , and they have , when they got ärmer .
BJ : On the one hand , there are a very <unk> line .
I don &apos;t have a look at the <unk> of the <unk> .
It &apos;s obvious , was that he has no <unk> , but a lack of money , and so you can &apos;t handle a lack of money , and you can do the benefit of a huge , very , very large , very large , very großen , very large , very large .
And for the other hand , I , I , I , I , I , is a very different story .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , very <unk> , you know ?
That &apos;s not true for Emotionen .
CA : But Danny , the whole American continent has grown to live , Freiheit and global Streben .
As a result , when people think about it , it &apos;s all about it in the way that we &apos;re thinking about , &quot; <unk> and <unk> , and so .
Is he a chance of having the belief that this nation , in the middle of this thing , and the öffentlichen law is suffering , and the öffentlichen law do that ?
DK : <unk> , I think he has Anerkennung of <unk> in the öffentlichen law .
The way that it has happened in the United States is not an Zweifel , but in the same case , but in the U.K . , in the UK , and in other countries .
So , when they realize that they &apos;re thinking about Glück , when they think about the <unk> .
It &apos;s going to have a time to wake up and streiten over the way that they &apos;re going to study or <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> , how many years ago .
So , you know , very different from the way that you &apos;re thinking about , and you &apos;re thinking about it , or you &apos;re thinking about the <unk> oder so I am <unk> .
In this case , in the back of the year , I think .
In the United States , in the United States , they &apos;ve managed to <unk> the <unk> .
I mean , there might be been in a been in 20 years of the <unk> .
CA : Okay , so I think that , in the case , the very interesting thing is that , for the next few years , for the years , for the years , there might be been for for the next few Jahren .
Thank you very much for the power of <unk> .
Danke , Danny <unk> .
I have to talk about the power and Klima .
And so , that might be very überraschend , because my Vollzeitjob , in the great way , is to work in the world and the Samen , in the same way that people die and the world , for the ärmsten two Milliarden .
But the water and the extreme Klima is great for all of these people , the same way of doing the same way in the world .
The Klimawandel has not been going to their own food .
It &apos;s a lot of rain falling out of it , too .
Things are going to be able to change your zerbrechlichen Umwelt , and you can &apos;t afford it .
And this has an Hunger to Hunger . It führt zu <unk> .
So , the Klimawandel has a certain metric for them .
The power of the power is great for them .
In fact , when you &apos;re out at the same time , you can do that , um günstiger and <unk> , to reduce the <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s very , very , very dense in the <unk> .
In the World Trade Organization , in the industriellen Revolution , and , in the 20th century , in the 20th century , which was a very schnellen <unk> for the power , and so , in the same way , in the same way that we can make modern Materialien and so many things .
And so you have a fantastic situation in the reichen world .
But now , because we &apos;re billiger -- and we can do it so billig -- and so on , it &apos;s a neuer Einschränkung , and you can do it mit CO2 .
And so , CO2 from the <unk> of the planet , and the Vergleich of carbon dioxide is very simple .
As one of the <unk> , the CO2 that has <unk> , which führt up dead , and that Anstieg , and that Anstieg , has a very negative impact .
And so , the impact of this and , well , very , very <unk> , the <unk> effects , dass natürliche Ökosysteme , and so it can &apos;t fit into the schnellen situation , and so on and so on .
Well , the right amount of time , in a finite amount of CO2 in order to reach out and where the positive <unk> is that you &apos;re all <unk> , you know , but not very much .
And there &apos;s a lot of Unsicherheit in ways that very , very much , but they &apos;re serious .
I have a very , very <unk> .
can you really get out of it ?
If we don &apos;t have a <unk> or <unk> ?
And the answer is that , in this way , in the middle of nowhere , the <unk> is ansteigen .
And this is a huge Herausforderung .
In the same way , this is very different in a way that they &apos;re going to get a four Meter hohe LKW in the middle of 25 Meter , and so on .
This is a very , very <unk> .
Well , we have a lot of carbon dioxide in the world , more than 26 million metric tons .
At the same American , this is about 20 Tonnen .
For the poor countries in poor countries , it &apos;s less than any metric .
It &apos;s a typical way of looking at all the time .
And we can have , as you can , very , very , very <unk> .
It &apos;s getting out of it .
So , but a huge amount of time , and you can have a huge amount of death , and you can have a huge decline in a <unk> , and a Rückgang at Null .
The second is four Faktoren .
A little <unk> .
So , you know , you have a huge power , carbon dioxide , that you will have to <unk> , and that &apos;s based on the individuals , the <unk> Service , the <unk> Service , the <unk> for every single Service , and the CO2 emissions from the <unk> .
So , you know , also , you know , also , in the way that you &apos;re thinking , well , you can get out in Null .
One of the ones that you &apos;re going to have , is one of the <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> , but let &apos;s face it .
First of all , we have the <unk> .
Today , the world has been <unk> Milliarden .
This is an average of neun Milliarden .
At the same time , when we were able to do this very well with people , Gesundheitspflege , <unk> Gesundheitssystem , and maybe 10 or 15 Prozent , but there &apos;s a Zuwachs about 1.3 .
The second Faktor is the <unk> that we &apos;re using .
All of that , all of this , the food that we cook , Kleidung , <unk> , <unk> .
This is a very good thing , and that &apos;s how many of it , Armut , all the way of all the people around the world .
So , here &apos;s amazing , as the number of <unk> .
In the reichen world , maybe the top one Milliarde , you can probably reduce the rate of <unk> and <unk> , but at the same time , this is the equivalent of the <unk> , and so on , the <unk> Services , and so on , the <unk> Service is more than verdoppelt .
This is a very simple <unk> .
So , you know , when you &apos;re in your Hause , your personal teacher , the way that these kids don &apos;t do , they &apos;re going to get out of <unk> , and they &apos;re reading their Hausaufgaben in the <unk> .
So , Effizienz , E , the power for every <unk> .
Endlich , in a very good way .
We have something that didn &apos;t work .
We can ask by various Erfindungen and personal in their own kinds of other types of Autos , different kinds of <unk> .
He &apos;s a lot of a lot of the <unk> , where you can get the power of the <unk> .
And for a couple of deaths , in fact , 90 percent .
He &apos;s a different kind of Dienstleistungen , so you know , so how do you deal with <unk> , where you can handle your <unk> , where the amount of kleiner is smaller .
And so , as if you &apos;re optimistic , there are three dead dead , maybe , you can do a Faktor six .
But for the first three Faktoren , we &apos;re von 26 Milliarden , at the best , 13 billion , and so it &apos;s not genug .
So , at the same time , you &apos;re looking at the <unk> -- this is a <unk> -- and that &apos;s the CO2 <unk> by <unk> .
So the way that you &apos;re going to have to get rid of the <unk> ?
When it comes to Kohle , we don &apos;t .
When they &apos;re Erdgas , they don &apos;t .
<unk> every way , at the same way , in the power of power , the <unk> erneuerbare Energien and Atomenergie , produziert CO2 .
And so , at the global scale , there ’ s a neues System .
And so , you can have <unk> .
So , when I ’ re able to use the <unk> , I don &apos;t have a way of doing it .
The <unk> is a Wunder . The <unk> is a Wunder .
The Internet and services are a <unk> .
So , the people here have a lot of passion .
In a way , they don &apos;t have a <unk> , when they got the people in a single Datum .
In the way , they just wake up , and sometimes they don &apos;t .
This is a way that , at the same time , at full speed , and you can have a Wunder , in a very enge performance .
Now , I thought , well , I thought , well , was can you do that ?
Is he a kind of natürlicher part of the way that , at the end of the person , who , in the way , in the <unk> ?
And I thought , in a way , in a way , in a way , when I took a bunch of them in the way that they took them to the one in the one of the anderen Art.
And the idea is that , in the way , in the way that he was in the world , the people who are living with them .
So , you know , the only thing that I thought was going to remember .
So I beschloss , very simple , very simple , as my Beitrag in the world .
So here we have a couple of <unk> .
I tell you that they didn &apos;t resolve , but they &apos;re not going to be another Topf .
So , he &apos;s all sorts of <unk> Lösungen , so they don &apos;t have a real <unk> .
We can have Lösungen , one of many , many , many , many <unk> and so on , all the way in many Richtungen , and so , in many Richtungen , in many Richtungen , in many Richtungen .
And so I took a lot of <unk> , geothermische Energie , <unk> , <unk> .
You might be able to put it in the same way , and when I got it in the same way , that , in the same way , I think , in the same way that you &apos;re going to be able to support all of these five and every one of these five , and he can &apos;t zulassen , weil es so <unk> , weil es so <unk> , weil es so so <unk> , weil they all have our own bedeutende Schwierigkeiten .
But then , after the fossilen Brennstoffe , the Verbrennung of Kohle processing , which is processing Erdgas .
So , you can do it , so it might be very simple , but that &apos;s not .
So , you can get all the CO2 out of the <unk> , and they can turn out , and they have to do it , and they have a long run , and they have a lot of it , and hoffen that , in the way that it &apos;s quiet .
Now , he has a couple of <unk> that have auf 60 bis 80 Prozent , but in 100 percent , and 100 percent , well , you &apos;re very <unk> and bestimmen können , was very schwierig , and so on , so the <unk> was the <unk> .
So , how do you all know ?
So , how does he reach for a very , very , very , very <unk> , so much of the way that you &apos;re thinking about in terms of all sorts of <unk> or other things ?
This is a huge Volumen .
So , that &apos;s how schwierig .
That one is nuklearer power .
In fact , there are three huge problems .
The cost , in a very large country , is enormous .
The issue of security , right , in fact , ist , dass all right , so that all of you can do was that , all dies , so you can have the same <unk> , dass man keine <unk> <unk> kann .
And was do you with the Müll ?
And so , that &apos;s not so much of it , so he &apos;s a lot of it .
And then , you know , he has a very good idea .
So , three very difficult problems , who might be lösbar , and , well , for you can do it .
The last one of the five , I am <unk> .
This is a very , very <unk> <unk> .
And that -- although it &apos;s amazing , they don &apos;t need a <unk> -- you have a certain degree .
One of the ones that you &apos;re going to do is that , in fact , the lower power of the power is actually falling apart from the <unk> .
This is <unk> , and man will have über a very long <unk> , tausende <unk> , for a normal power .
So , this is the <unk> <unk> .
The point is that the Sonne is not very <unk> , and not every day , and so , no matter , it doesn &apos;t happen .
And so , when you &apos;re out of the <unk> , you can have a way of thinking about power in the way that they &apos;re not verfügbar .
So , you have a lot of <unk> here .
We have a <unk> Herausforderungen .
So , when you think that this Energiequelle has gone beyond your Land , and you have not only the technology , but you know , you know , in the <unk> of the Energie von anderswo .
And , finally , the <unk> .
And so , in the same way , I used to all the Arten of Batterien , for the Autos , for the <unk> , for the <unk> , for the <unk> , for all the power , and verglichen damit , dass all diese Batterien , and so I thought all the Batterien , all the way in all unserer Energie for all the Energie .
So , you can have a massive <unk> , that you have a <unk> that you have .
It &apos;s not unmöglich , but it &apos;s not very simple .
This is a huge amount of time after the <unk> <unk> percent of the treatment , for 30 to 30 percent of all the time .
At a certain point , for 100 percent , you can get a <unk> .
Well , you know , also , you know , who are the richtigen <unk> ?
Is it a <unk> ? You can do that ?
Well , you can have a lot of power that he can do , hunderte .
In each one of these five nights , mindestens 100 percent .
And so , for a lot of them , they &apos;re <unk> .
And I think here in the <unk> , we have a lot of the people who &apos;ve been working on all the time .
Bill <unk> has a different set of <unk> . One of these is called <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in some more of these great things , and I have a very positive and interesting person , and I can &apos;t support the <unk> .
Nathan Myhrvold : I &apos;m going to give you a company that I &apos;m going to give you a company , which is , well , this is not überraschend for Atomenergie .
He has a Reihe <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and flüssiges .
And he has all sorts of Innovation in the same power , so it &apos;s not very seltsam that he &apos;s good old Ideen .
The idea of <unk> is that , anstatt a small <unk> Uran out ; a Prozent , the <unk> , so <unk> , entschieden , that 99 percent <unk> .
A little <unk> .
So , you know , you &apos;re thinking about it , but they didn &apos;t have a very good way of doing it .
But by the <unk> that you can do , and yes yes !
With the right stuff , this is probably going to do that .
And so , for the 99 percent , reduce cost cost enormous .
So , by the way , we used to use the <unk> , and as Brennstoff as well , you can use all the remaining <unk> of <unk> .
So , in order to give you a neuen Treibstoff , which is super .
This is the Uran in the way that it &apos;s in the <unk> .
In this shot , it &apos;s a very common <unk> called <unk> .
For the <unk> , this is the real case .
I &apos;m here to have a place in Kentucky .
This is <unk> , 99 percent , in a 1 percent .
This is called <unk> Uran .
This is for the United States for the United States .
And so , in a very efficient way , Meerwasser down the way genug Brennstoff was around the entire planet .
So he &apos;s a lot of a lot of a lot of people , but it &apos;s a case of many hundreds and hundreds of individuals , and hundreds and hundreds of individuals , die wir brauchen , um an hour zu gehen .
So , how do we think , well , how do we ?
So , how do we get back ?
So , when you first think about it , and in the <unk> .
For 2050 , there &apos;s a lot of men with 80 years of survival .
And so , really , really , really , really , really bad .
And 20 percent of the water has been working in poor countries , a <unk> .
And so , you can have a <unk> and <unk> .
So , in order for 80 percent , in a billion countries , in many cases , of land , as China , they &apos;ve got to climb out of the <unk> .
And the other set of <unk> : Do you have <unk> Technologien in all entwickelten Ländern , and are we doing that anderswo ?
That &apos;s a great thing .
This is a very wichtigen <unk> for the second .
So , you know , you know , in 2020 , he in 2020 ?
Well , you can stay out of the world .
We can get rid of the reduction in the <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , much less like gas , and so much like oil .
But in some sense , the way that we can do , in the way that we don &apos;t have to do all this , in the very large <unk> , maybe , maybe , vielleicht , vielleicht , vielleicht , maybe , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very global zu verstehen .
All of those numbers can have survived at full Geschwindigkeit , and we can control the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So here &apos;s a huge amount of neat Büchern .
The very world of Al Gore , &quot; The <unk> , &quot; and the Middle World History Buch , &quot; <unk> energy , &quot; &quot; <unk> energy , &quot;
So , when they really do it , it &apos;s very positive to do that in a huge amount of relationships , because we can have a shot of <unk> <unk> .
He can have a lot of it .
So this is a kind of a Wunsch .
It &apos;s a very konkreten Wunsch that you &apos;re going to get .
As a consequence , for the years , for the 50 years , I would argue like the <unk> , I could do a Impfstoff , I could do a Impfstoff , which I would argue , was a way of doing that , or I was able to do that by the cost of the cost of the cost , which is the Wunsch of the day .
This is the first impact .
As soon as we don &apos;t have to have this time , the Trennung of the people who are thinking about very much and langfristig , in a long time , it &apos;s significant , in between the United States and China , from the poor and rich , and most of the world in the world has been going to much worse .
So , was can you do ?
What do I hope for you ?
We &apos;ve got a long <unk> of <unk> .
As a country , when they come in a Copenhagen , they don &apos;t have to talk to the CO2 .
The reason for that is that they have to listen to all of these <unk> , and they &apos;re very excited to be out of the very great <unk> for the innovativen <unk> .
We can have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and a <unk> , which is the cost of the cost of <unk> .
We can tell the <unk> .
And so , the relationship between the ages of <unk> and <unk> , including the <unk> , including the <unk> .
This is a wichtigen Wunsch , but I think you can do it .
Vielen Dank .
Vielen Dank .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Now , I &apos;m thinking about <unk> , OK , I mean , the first person , I mean , are you , right ?
Bill Gates : At the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , all of the young doctors , all of the time , and all of these , and all of you , in a very , very <unk> , and all of you now , in a russischen <unk> , he will be able to be able to be able to be able to do so much in the tens of thousands of millions .
It &apos;s very difficult to do the <unk> because of the few billion , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
On the one hand , when the first one is , as the <unk> , it &apos;s very <unk> , so it &apos;s very <unk> , because the power , the <unk> , so different are so different compared to the power .
CA : And yes , and yes , in the way it &apos;s very good at the surface of the ground , and so on the surface of the <unk> , so the <unk> <unk> Uran , and so fängt the Prozess an to the <unk> and so on ?
BG : That &apos;s true . At the same time , we can have a long <unk> , and you have a lot of the people and a lot of the tools that you can do in the wrong way , and so on .
That &apos;s not okay .
So , when you have a very efficient <unk> for your 60 years -- he would give you the <unk> -- and he has no longer an <unk> .
And so it &apos;s got out of 60 Jahren , and there &apos;s been out there .
CA : So , it &apos;s a <unk> , which is a <unk> .
BG : Yeah . Well . Well , was he with the <unk> , so he can -- he can -- he &apos;s a lot less <unk> -- or you can get it out in a different way , and you can <unk> it in another and <unk> it in a another and <unk> .
And we &apos;re starting to start with the Müll , das has been in the <unk> , in the <unk> .
And so , that &apos;s the <unk> .
So , a lot of the deal with these Reaktoren , in fact , in the way that it has been in the <unk> , and so , the power of the <unk> , the power of the <unk> .
CA : But in your global conversation about all the time , where is the best Interesse , really , really , really , really , really ?
BG : Well , that &apos;s not a certain guy , and he &apos;s all very interesting about all of this , and he &apos;s all very interesting about all of these <unk> , so we have a lot of <unk> , dass people in China , Indien , China .
I have the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> , um darüber zu sprechen , wie in the <unk> .
I &apos;m optimistic about it . You know , the Franzosen and the Japaner were going to have been making .
This is a Variante for that .
It &apos;s a wichtigen Schritt voraus , but it &apos;s a very schnellen <unk> , and a lot of land , and so many of you have , and every one who has a long <unk> , is a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
CA : So , in the way , in your ability , Zeitplan and Wahrscheinlichkeit from that way ?
BG : Well , well , you can have a huge amount of power in a huge amount of power , and you can have 20 years old , and for 20 years , and for 20 years , and for 20 years , for the <unk> .
And that &apos;s a kind of <unk> that you can have , who can get out of that .
And so , you know , <unk> , as all of a sudden , very much , was a lot of the people who can do so much .
And he has been working for a couple of years , and he can support hundreds of thousands of individuals who , who , when they failed , they were working on the <unk> for their <unk> , so that they can do with it .
And so it &apos;s the best way of doing it is that you can control of all the <unk> .
We can have one of them , for a long time .
CA : In terms of the situation in the same Ausmaß , is that the greatest ones that you know ?
BG : <unk> : <unk> .
So , that &apos;s what happened , right , in this case , without the <unk> , but the <unk> makes it so much worse .
In the U.S . , there are other Innovatoren .
You know , you know , we don &apos;t know how to do this , but the <unk> of the ones , but the <unk> of the <unk> .
He &apos;s a type of <unk> that it &apos;s very difficult for , but they said , well , you know , so they said that .
So he &apos;s a different one , but the beauty of this is that you have a million times as much energy as <unk> , and so , as you can do with the negative Effekte , the <unk> , the <unk> and the cost , the <unk> and the cost of all the time , is in a very nice <unk> .
CA : When do you not do that ?
But do we start with <unk> , um versuchen , an economic der Erde stabil zu halten ?
BG : So , when you think in this situation , it &apos;s as if you have a nuclear energy , and you have an opportunity to have a Herzinfarkt .
So , where do you have to go ? You can have a <unk> or so .
He &apos;s a <unk> that are called Geo-Engineering , that are all sorts of <unk> Techniken , in the same way that we had to buy 20 or 30 years of all the time .
That &apos;s a very helpful twist .
You don &apos;t have to have it .
One of the people who said , well , no way , you can &apos;t even do that , because the way they &apos;re doing faul , the way it &apos;s important , is that he &apos;s having a <unk> , because , you know , he has a <unk> for the <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s intelligent , you know , the Wichtigkeit des Problems , but he has the Geo-Engineering Diskussion darüber , in the <unk> for the <unk> , oder when Innovation kills , and so on .
CA : <unk> Skeptiker : At a way , when they say one or two Sätze dead , you &apos;d say , well , what was they going to be wrong ?
BG : Well , surprisingly , this is a common part of all of this .
He he he very , very few of these wissenschaftlichen Argumenten .
<unk> , that he have negatives Feedback to do these things , and they have to have the same things ?
It &apos;s very , very few , very few things that they say , well , he can tell you a single <unk> .
The worst is that we have here right now that AIDS .
You know , they have the wrong thing , and they &apos;ll do a lot more .
And yes , when you have all sorts of pressing problems , the way that it takes over the way that it &apos;s getting worse , and you have a very counterintuitive Schmerzen .
In fact , the <unk> is not notwendigerweise the schlimmsten <unk> , and he &apos;s the <unk> in the reichen world and says , well , that &apos;s all very important in the IPCC and say , well , that &apos;s all very .
It was the <unk> that you &apos;re going to get out .
But my dream is that , when they reach out and reach out and stay out of the <unk> , that they say , well , in order to do it , I can &apos;t worry about CO2 , I might not have a carbon footprint , so I might even assume , dass , in fact , it might be <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> .
CA : And so , all the way in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , ist , dass , in fact , all the power of all the power from the <unk> , and so on all the other sides of all the other Ziele , and so on .
It &apos;s a dumme <unk> of <unk> , um Geld auszugeben , wenn he <unk> , and so it can make you possible .
BG : Well , the true cost of the F is that the United States has been 10 billion more likely to have 10 million years ago .
The point is not <unk> .
It ’ s right there in a huge amount of money , and so you can get positive people in the same way , when it &apos;s a very good person , when it &apos;s <unk> .
I mean , I think , in a way , is a <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s not very dense in the way that it &apos;s going to be the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
And I think you can have a couple of things , and you can have a huge amount of teuer .
As the <unk> , when you start , you can do things very teuer , so there &apos;s a huge amount of stuff .
I mean , all of you can do five times as many times as many people in the way that they &apos;re going to be able to go .
The metric is for the two billion .
And you know , <unk> has happened .
Now , there is a lot of <unk> D with F D in the same D .
There &apos;s one of the things that happens in the first few people , with the <unk> camp , but there was a very einsam camp in the back , and so , here &apos;s the F <unk> .
And so he has a roten Faden that I think is a very strong <unk> .
And so , you know , very much the F D is <unk> .
CA : Bill , I suspect , I think , in the words of all the men here , when I said , dass I really hoffe , really , really , really , really , really , really , all of my hope is .
BG : Thank you very much .
<unk> , I noticed a few Monate , when I was a Artikel for the <unk> Wired magazine .
I am the <unk> for the hand , and I am <unk> , but I &apos;m going to get out of the <unk> and I didn &apos;t know that I was &quot; <unk> &quot; .
I &apos;m going to be looking at the phone .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : gesundes , stark , <unk> . &quot;
I read this for a friend , and then I was laughing out the way that it was so silly , but I started to get out of &quot; <unk> &quot; , and I was going to get out of the <unk> , and I was going to get out , um an emotional Schock and Schlag out all the way out .
Okay , so that &apos;s a great great alten <unk> .
I think this is a very common <unk> , right ?
But what was going on in the very first place in the beginning , when I started , in the Grundschule , and a Statue begann , and an image of my own Familie begann , and I was an alternative to this , and I am an alternative to the other children and the world around .
I don &apos;t have to say that I didn &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> .
With the scene that I think in a way , when I was born in a world in a way , when I thought , when I was thinking , when I was a kid , I think , if you didn &apos;t even say , I &apos;m very fond of writing the people and Abenteuer in my life .
So I went to the same way in 2009 in 2009 in 2009 , and I would expect a very nice <unk> to do .
This is the <unk> Version des <unk> .
<unk> are not very different .
I think most of the words in &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; , <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; .
It &apos;s not only about Wörtern .
And so , for the sake of the people , people , when we put them in the same way .
The <unk> of the audience , and , you know , the <unk> .
And so , when you think about it , and you think , and you know , you know , the way we live in the world , and you know , you know , the way we look at other people .
For example , many very common individuals , who they and the <unk> glaubten , they thought , well , it &apos;s a very powerful way of doing so mächtig , because , when you said , that &apos;s what was happening .
But for the real way , a person who &apos;s going to tell you , you know , or a person who &apos;s the <unk> ?
So , when you do a very simple thing , as the <unk> of a single person , a man , when she was <unk> , and she <unk> den Schatten on her power .
Do you not lieber Türen for them ?
One of the <unk> for me , when I was a Arzt , when I was a kid , when I was a kid , the <unk> Institute in <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s called Dr. <unk> .
<unk> , whose name is <unk> , which is what was called Dr. P. <unk> .
Dr. P. <unk> trug very <unk> <unk> and <unk> the very good institution , and that &apos;s the very guten institution to do with kids .
I kind of genoss all of it in the same way that I was in the <unk> of the <unk> .
I was able to create a very , very difficult <unk> for the tall <unk> <unk> -- verschiedener Farben -- for the <unk> -- for the <unk> .
I don &apos;t like the <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if they took the name . I don &apos;t know .
As a <unk> , I used to be with Dr. <unk> , in the way that they &apos;re going to get out of these techniques , not so many things .
There was a chance in a session -- <unk> and <unk> were the <unk> -- and I said , &quot; Wow . Aimee , you &apos;re a huge , powerful Mädchen , so I think you &apos;re going to be a <unk> <unk> .
At the end , I &apos;ll give you 100 Dollar . &quot;
Now , that &apos;s a very important one from Dr. <unk> , P , who I didn &apos;t do with the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but I am the <unk> <unk> <unk> Mädchen , but , was there for me , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very <unk> .
Today , I said , I &apos;m going to have a lot of the first person in the face of a lot and I &apos;m a stark and most powerful Mädchen , so I noticed a very , very rich , stark , stark , <unk> and <unk> person in the morning .
This is a case of the <unk> in <unk> the power of a <unk> .
But in the back of this case , in the previous case , because of the fact that , in fact , in fact , in the way that people in the world in the world , the only way we &apos;re going to do all of the time , the chance for the individual to become as <unk> .
And so , in the same way that people don &apos;t have to have , and many , many of you have in the face of Technologie .
In a way , my Beine , my Beine , <unk> for <unk> , Titan , <unk> and <unk> for the natural world , and so people in the face of the <unk> <unk> , and so on , in the face of the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the way that people are capable of <unk> , and to be able to be able to be able to vereinen , and , in the same individuals , for a half , for a half , who they can own .
So , in fact , most of you might be able to have a lot of hell , that you have a lot of hell , and you can have a lot of it , and you can have a lot of it , and you have a lot of <unk> , and you can have , and , you know , in the power for people , and so , dass wir uns an unserer <unk> anpassen .
The power of the Menschheit is interesting , because everybody möchte to talk to me about the überwinden , and I have a very , very <unk> .
And so I don &apos;t have to be very comfortable , and I &apos;m going to give you sad to ask for people , and I &apos;ll start thinking , warum .
The <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; , who bedeutet , dass Erfolg oder Glück bedeutet , dass man wieder an einer <unk> Erfahrung , <unk> , ohne <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so dass meine Erfolge an der Basis von <unk> <unk> <unk> , who would argue , was an meinen Behinderung zutrifft .
But in the real world , it &apos;s very , very , very <unk> , very , very emotional , emotional of both .
And I think that was a very good thing .
<unk> is not a Hindernis on the way that they müssen , but in the way it &apos;s Leben .
It &apos;s a Teil unseres Lebens .
I feel the way my Schatten was .
In fact , I don &apos;t have a lot of it , it &apos;s very , very short , but I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t have to have a lot of the impact and the Wichtigkeit von <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> and <unk> in the Leben , and it &apos;s all real .
Unsere Verantwortung is also not easy to go out of your Lieben , but we don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
We don &apos;t know , when we did not , when we give them no Angebot , when we left them , they &apos;re not going to fit in .
He &apos;s a wichtigen Unterschied and Unterscheidung zwischen the objektiven <unk> and the subjektiven <unk> of the subjektiven <unk> , so I am not <unk> .
The only ones , the only ones that I said , the only ones I see in the face of the world is the only way of all the time , I can tell you the <unk> .
In a way , and in a way , and all of a sudden , all of the <unk> Fakten of all the time in their own Prognose , or a Prognose , or a Prognose , müssen wir sicherstellen , dass wir nicht the first Stein in the <unk> <unk> , mit denen wir <unk> .
You know , the situation of the way he has been thinking about , and , you know , you can reparieren someone else in the way that you might gain from the <unk> .
And by the way , not from the &quot; <unk> &quot; von a person , in the way that they don &apos;t recognize the same , they can set up a neuen Kranken on the natürlicher Kampf that they might have .
In fact , you know , for the fact that people have an impact on a society .
We can also start by the way that we &apos;re looking at the very individual &apos;s body .
The <unk> is that he has a Kooperation between the very <unk> <unk> and the greatest kreativen <unk> .
He doesn &apos;t look at the difficult way of <unk> or <unk> , but in the <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> , but in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> .
Now , the idea is that I &apos;m going to have a way of doing that , and they &apos;re not going to be überwinden like that , but they &apos;re sitting on the phone , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be able to really , really , really .
As a consequence , as well , as well , as well , and <unk> and nützlich , you might feel less of <unk> .
In fact , this year four years ago , Charles Darwin , and as if there was 150 years ago in the same way that Darwin wrote Darwin in Darwin , I think , in a way , in the menschlichen <unk> .
There &apos;s certainly not the most reliable person in the way that you might expect , nor the <unk> , but the kind of intelligent , but the kind of person that am the best moves .
<unk> is the <unk> .
In other words , in the other way of thinking , dass the difference in the way that the menschlichen can überleben and <unk> by the mental Kampf is by the mental Kampf .
Again , <unk> , <unk> , which is a huge benefit .
And in the case , at the <unk> , we didn &apos;t know how to go .
Now , you know , that &apos;s a lot of a sudden , <unk> , <unk> , a response unserer own power .
We ’ ve got to give them a <unk> .
As long as we can do this , as you can imagine , as you have to do it , it &apos;s very difficult for you .
Well , you can think of it as a woman .
<unk> Wandel , which was , in fact , are not <unk> .
I think the <unk> <unk> that you have , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
What is normal ?
It &apos;s not normal .
He &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s typical . It &apos;s not normal .
And how do he kind of <unk> the poor person ?
I didn &apos;t think .
As soon as you can all <unk> the <unk> in <unk> , a single <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and so you can <unk> the power of many mehr Kinder , and give them our seltenen and wertvollen Fähigkeiten with the Gemeinden .
<unk> said that was the only one , all of the time , people who have been able to get nützlich in the <unk> of <unk> .
He has a couple of years ago that they did 60,000 years ago and serious <unk> <unk> , maybe , because the <unk> and the Überleben of the child in terms of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , that they did not think the <unk> and <unk> .
In a couple of years , I am a couple of years at the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> , and I stand an <unk> Tomaten .
It &apos;s a very short store . I had a very short store .
I &apos;ll tell you a little bit about this : &quot; Well , when you don &apos;t know Aimee <unk> . &quot;
I used to show up , and I didn &apos;t know what was going on .
I said , &quot; <unk> , know ? I can &apos;t be thinking . &quot;
And there &apos;s a way of saying that you don &apos;t understand , you know , you know .
If we got back to the outside , I got on the phone . &quot;
Oh , the <unk> .
And that &apos;s a lot of the <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , the <unk> , you know , you know , in my own words , and I &apos;m going to talk about my mom &apos;s stories of the day , because I didn &apos;t take my own in the first place for my own Geburtstag .
My mom &apos;s <unk> in the Urlaub , so that they were going to be in the Urlaub , so that they were a brilliant for my Eltern .
And I don &apos;t even have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and a couple of Zehen at the one , and a few Zehen on the one and the other Fuß , musste the bad news .
I said , &quot; Well , I was going to give you the <unk> for the client , and you don &apos;t have the <unk> , and niemals the <unk> hätten that other kids can have no unabhängiges Leben , and in the middle of every day , and in the middle of this Augenblick , and so on , for a minute . &quot;
The third thing that er said , dass there in my childhood , when I was born in my own Kindheit , or that , when I was a <unk> in the U.S . Air Force , the <unk> in Halloween , my <unk> has made by the <unk> of <unk> , and so on , there are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> an <unk> College and the <unk> .
You know , there &apos;s this <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
No Prognose voraussagen you kann vorhersagen , so mächtig to the <unk> for the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> walked out , and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make sure that , when they don &apos;t even have <unk> , and right now , and , in fact , rather , very small , you have a Kind on a moment . &quot;
You know , Dr. <unk> <unk> would have happened .
There was a Unterschied between the <unk> Zustand and a person who can do it .
And in the process of the time , I think , because , when they asked , when they asked , when I was a <unk> , or I was going to <unk> my <unk> , I didn &apos;t even play it .
So , I kind of , in the <unk> , I kind of , in the <unk> .
When I said , well , I don &apos;t know so much .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , is that , right , I don &apos;t know , trotz all the kinds of things that they did .
Now , that might have happened in this way , because I &apos;ve got people in the <unk> , the <unk> for me , and they have a <unk> .
So , you know , you &apos;re going to be a single person who has ever been , and you have to have the odds of your own power , and you have to go .
One of the things that you have , when you get your own power to your own power , the menschlichen Geist is so <unk> , and at a certain point a Tür for someone to öffnen , will man es auf the best .
The way they ever come home is to be <unk> .
The right Bedeutung des Wortes &quot; <unk> &quot; is <unk> .
