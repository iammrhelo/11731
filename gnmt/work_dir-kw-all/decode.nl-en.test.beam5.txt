A few years ago , Peter <unk> here , at TED , a <unk> show .
The <unk> .
The idea is pretty simple : Four should have to be able to build a <unk> <unk> with 20 units , a meter , a <unk> , and a marshmallow .
The marshmallow needs to be on top .
And , even though it sounds very simple , it turns out it &apos;s very difficult , because this is forcing people to work very quickly together .
And because I found this interesting idea , I decided to take it into a design studio .
And it was a big success .
Since then , I &apos;ve done this practice in about 70 <unk> around the world with students , designers and architects , and even with bosses from Fortune magazine companies .
And this exercise gives us deep insights into how humans cooperate , and I want to share with you some of them .
Normally it &apos;s the first step that people prepare to prepare .
They talk about it , imagine what it &apos;s going to look like , playing <unk> .
And then they &apos;re planning to organize .
They sketch and bottles .
Most of the time , they &apos;re building bigger <unk> of spaghetti .
And at the end , when it &apos;s almost all around , someone is the marshmallow they put it on , they just take a step back and -- <unk> !
They admire their jobs .
But what happens is what happens , usually , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; changes in a &quot; O &quot; , because the weight of the marshmallow was going to <unk> the entire <unk> and <unk> .
Certain people have more of those &quot; <unk> &quot; than others .
What &apos;s the worst of the children &apos;s <unk> .
They &apos;re lying , they are cheating , get distracted , and they &apos;re making pretty stupid .
And of course , there &apos;s a lot of other teams to create a lot more <unk> .
And at the best among them , they have college <unk> .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s impressive .
And Peter tells us that it &apos;s not only the highest <unk> , but it &apos;s also the most interesting one .
So what you &apos;re wondering is , how can this ? Why ? What do these kids do ?
Female response is , &quot; No of the kids wasting time to be the boss of spaghetti . &quot; Right ?
They don &apos;t waste time with <unk> .
But there &apos;s another reason .
And that &apos;s how economists are trained to find the only appropriate solution .
And then they go to those .
But what happens when they put the marshmallow on , they have no time .
It &apos;s a disaster .
Sounds familiar , sure ?
What kids do differently ,
is that they begin with the marshmallow .
They build prototypes , and new prototypes ...
Still with the marshmallow , so they have more opportunities to fix the good prototypes .
Designers recognize this form of cooperation as the basis of a <unk> process .
In every version , the children get instant feedback on some of the things that don &apos;t work .
So building prototypes is very important .
But let &apos;s look at how different teams do it .
The average number for most people is about 50 inches --
Now , economists take half of them , lawyers are doing something , but not much better .
<unk> , better than most adults .
Who &apos;s doing it ?
Architects and engineers , happy .
The highest construction I &apos;ve seen was a meter high .
And why ? Because they understand triangles , and <unk> <unk> structures are the key to building stable <unk> .
CEOs , a little bit better than on average .
But now it &apos;s interesting , if you put a secretary in the team , they &apos;re getting pieces better .
Incredible . You see the team and he thinks , &quot; That &apos;s going to win . &quot;
That &apos;s what you can see from before .
because they &apos;re good at supporting .
They manage , understand the process .
And each team that &apos;s good is and attention to the work is going to work the performance of that team ,
<unk> and supportive skills , lead to a success .
If you normally have 10 teams , this is going to be going to be around the six ,
And I tried something interesting .
And I thought , we &apos;re making it a little bit more exciting .
So , I put 10,000 dollars into software on the winning team .
And what do you think this <unk> ?
What happened ?
The next .
And no one just had a <unk> installation .
A <unk> of that , for example , was one inch enough to win .
And what &apos;s interesting is that it has huge stakes big .
We &apos;ve repeated the practice with the same students .
And what do you think that happened ?
So now they understand the use of prototypes .
And this team changed the worst team in one of the best .
They made the highest <unk> in the lowest time .
So that &apos;s a good lesson for us about the nature of rewards and success .
You might wonder , why would anyone spend time thinking about writing a <unk> ?
The reason is , I &apos;m working with digital tools and processes to help teams building cars , <unk> and visual effects .
And the <unk> helps them to come behind the hidden assumptions .
Because , frankly , every project has his own marshmallow , right ?
The challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a collective institution to create the best prototype .
And that &apos;s the value of this so simple exercise .
And for whom <unk> , go to <unk> .
On this blog , you can see how to build the <unk> .
There are <unk> <unk> .
So , there are examples of how people all over the world in the world and <unk> .
There are also <unk> .
And the fundamental lesson is , I think , that &apos;s actually a <unk> thing .
It demands the deployment of all our senses , and that &apos;s what we think best , feeling and execution can apply to the challenge for us .
And sometimes a little prototype of this experience has already enough to change in &quot; <unk> &quot; moment in a <unk> moment .
And that makes a big difference .
Thank you so much .
Let &apos;s suppose that we have a machine , a big machine , a big machine , a cool machine , and it &apos;s still a time machine .
And everybody needs to .
You can take it back in time or forwards in time , but not right here ,
Now , I &apos;m curious what you might choose , because I asked this question , because I asked this question of friends , and they all want to go back .
They all want to go back to the time before cars or Twitter or &quot; American Idol &quot; .
I don &apos;t know .
And I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some <unk> to <unk> , to <unk> .
And I can get there .
But I don &apos;t belong there , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and not because I &apos;m designed to be designed -- but it &apos;s the possibilities of this planet .
That &apos;s not going backwards , moving forward .
So , I want to in the machine , and I want to move forward in time .
We live in the <unk> era of this planet at whatever level you want to see , wealth , wealth , mobility , chances of disease .
There was no time when this was .
My <unk> was all about the 60 .
My grandparents got all over the 70s .
And my parents are in the 80s .
So , I like to try to get there in the 90s .
But it &apos;s not just about us .
There &apos;s a lot more on the play .
A child who &apos;s born today in New Delhi is a life expectancy equivalent to the top of the richest man in the world in 100 years .
Think about that . That &apos;s an incredible fact .
And why ?
The smallpox epidemic . The smallpox set of people on this planet have taken their lives .
They had an impact on the demographics of this world than any of the war .
But they don &apos;t exist anymore . They are gone .
We &apos;ve conquered them . <unk> !
In the richer world , there are diseases of millions of people developed a generation of a million people , so as well as no .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
Do you know something else that was ?
<unk> , modern medicine , our ability to provide billions of food , are all the <unk> of the scientific method .
And for me , it &apos;s the scientific method , it tries to see , see , it works , and it won &apos;t take one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
That &apos;s the good news .
But sadly , the only good news because there are some other problems , they &apos;ve got a number of different problems , and one of them is that , despite all of our achievements , there &apos;s still a billion people hungry people still hungry in this world , every day .
Their numbers up , and it takes a <unk> .
And it &apos;s not just that we &apos;ve used our own imagination to contaminate this world as well .
<unk> water , agricultural water , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going to disappear and fast every time , and if we can &apos;t stand in the state of innovation out of this <unk> road , will we also disappear .
So , the question is : Can we ?
And I think it &apos;s clear that we can be able to take food for billions without the country where we live ,
I think that we can put this world of <unk> <unk> to the destruction of it .
I believe that , and , no , that &apos;s not <unk> .
But now that &apos;s what I wake up at night -- one of the things that I wake up at night .
We never have been so dependent on scientific advances , never , and never have been able to use it as we can use today as we can .
We are on the verge of the most amazing advances in all sorts of field .
And yet , I really believe that in hundreds of years , just 300 years , I &apos;ve got to go back to time for time of time in time of the Enlightenment , so that we came up with this innovation and more fields , fighting more fields , than today .
People hang their <unk> with such a <unk> that &apos;s almost impossible to liberate it .
And listen , everybody has right up to their own opinions ; everybody agrees to a own sense of what progress is , but you know where you don &apos;t ?
You don &apos;t own your own facts . No , you don &apos;t .
And I &apos;ve spent some time talking to you .
A dozen years ago , I wrote a story about &quot; The New Yorker &quot; , a short story .
And I was amazed to <unk> <unk> , which was in fact , in fact , the most effective <unk> of public health in history .
Now , I didn &apos;t know exactly what was , so I wrote a story about it , and I was going to go away .
A bit later , I wrote a story of genetically engineered food .
Again , the same , but even worse this time .
People will love .
So , I also wrote a story about this , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people could find this &quot; <unk> &quot; , why they thought that it &apos;s manipulating molecules to be based on a <unk> , rather than a random jumble of nature .
But , you know , I &apos;m doing what I do . I wrote a story , and I was going to go to the order of the day , and I &apos;m a journalist , and I type , we &apos;re doing it , we &apos;re going to go , and that &apos;s that .
But those stories kept me in , but I couldn &apos;t figure out why , but ultimately .
And because it was , because it made me crazy , in fact , in fact , didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
They were <unk> , right well , well , well .
Like the people in this room ,
And it was just that what &apos;s so <unk>
But then I thought , well , let &apos;s be honest , let &apos;s be fair at this world where we have no equal relation to progress ,
We talk about <unk> .
We speak ironic about <unk> .
&quot; Thank you . &quot;
Okay , there are reasons , and I think we &apos;re going to know them .
We have lost faith in institutions , in authority , in authority , and in the science itself , and there &apos;s no reason why not .
You just need to leave a few names , and people understand it .
Chernobyl , the <unk> , the Challenger , the Challenger , mass of weapons , <unk> punch cards --
I mean , you can put yourself on your list .
There are questions and problems with those people that we thought they were always right .
So , I &apos;m skeptical .
Ask , ask evidence and evidence , don &apos;t take away any of you .
But now it &apos;s , if you have to prove it , you have to pick them up , and that &apos;s not so good .
And the reason that I can say that , is that we can now live into a dead life and that we hope that it &apos;s going to be so quick ,
About 12 years ago , there was a terrible story published a terrible story , which was a connection between the epidemic of autism and the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> studies were done to be completed , or this was true .
And that was also true , it was a serious business .
The data came out .
They were found in the United States , in England , in Sweden , in Sweden , in Canada , and all the same results : not least , not least .
But it doesn &apos;t matter , because it doesn &apos;t matter because we don &apos;t include over anecdotes , we believe what we &apos;re seeing and seeing what we think , what we really think of .
We can &apos;t put a faith on a lot of paper of an official capacity of an official <unk> that allows us about data , and I can go there , and I think we can all agree .
But you know what ?
And the consequence was catastrophic , disastrous , and this was the fact that the United States is one of the few countries in the world where it &apos;s the number of vaccines against the measles .
That &apos;s a shame , and we should be ashamed .
It &apos;s terrible .
So what &apos;s going on with us on that ?
Now , I understand it .
Who else ?
Anybody of this audience ever had someone who was able to die of measles ?
It &apos;s not very common .
And this isn &apos;t even more , but it happened last year still last year in the world .
That &apos;s a bunch of deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
But because this can &apos;t happen , because it can &apos;t happen , and people like Jenny <unk> with it away from fear and ignorance in <unk> and <unk> in <unk> like Oprah and Larry King .
And they can do that because they can &apos;t distinguish between the causes and accidental <unk> of conditions .
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but it &apos;s not really real .
And that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and that we need to learn to learn
This guy was a hero , Jonas <unk> .
He <unk> our worst <unk> .
No fear , no more <unk> . Polio , <unk> !
That guy in the middle , even though .
He &apos;s called Paul <unk> .
He developed a vaccine against the <unk> with some other people .
It saved the lives of about 400,000 and 500,000 children in the developing world .
All right , right ?
Well , it &apos;s good , except that Paul <unk> with <unk> over vaccines , and how valuable they are .
and that people should stop it to <unk> .
And so he says it .
So , Paul was a terrorist .
Now , if he could hold a public speech , it can be only in <unk> .
He gets to phone calls because there are people who are he who is prize to tell him that they know where they are .
And why ? Because now Paul has developed a vaccine .
I don &apos;t need to say , but vaccines are <unk> .
Take away , and the disease will come back , awful disease , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
We have been in this country back in this country .
And it gets even worse , soon , soon , soon , soon he will die children when they get enough disease .
And they won &apos;t just die .
What about polio ? That &apos;s why ?
A former <unk> wrote a few weeks ago , and he said she liked me some <unk> <unk> .
No one told me it ever .
She didn &apos;t go to her child to polio .
In fact .
All right .
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio anymore . And you know what ?
Yesterday , polio was no longer for me .
But , who knows , this morning , this morning , he walked someone on an airplane in Lagos , and he &apos;s going to go to Los <unk> .
Within a few hours , he &apos;s going to <unk> a car and goes to Long Beach , where it &apos;s going to go to Long Beach ,
And he doesn &apos;t realize that it &apos;s contaminated with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on .
That &apos;s the planet that we live in , and this is not <unk> .
We &apos;d rather be packing in lies . We love it .
Does everyone have this morning <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> , a little <unk> to the day ?
I know it because half of Americans are every day .
She <unk> it , and she uses alternative drugs , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we discover that it &apos;s worthless .
The data point it all over again .
They &apos;re darker . And in fact , it &apos;s a bit more than that .
Okay , if you want to spend 28 billion dollars on a darker side for a white urine , it &apos;s all that .
Dark urine . <unk> .
Why are we doing this ? Why do we do ? I think I can understand Big <unk> .
We hate the government . We distrust the <unk> .
That &apos;s also true . Our <unk> are not too .
They are that for millions of our <unk> .
They are amazing <unk> and <unk> even for those of us who can afford them .
So , what is it ?
We jump into the <unk> of Big <unk> .
There &apos;s wonderful . I like Big <unk> .
But , you know , this is very different because the whole thing is rubbish , and we give it billions .
Now , I brought some of those things here .
<unk> , deception , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , I don &apos;t even know what &apos;s , but we give it billions .
And you know what ? Now , when I first tell these people to me , and they say , &quot; What does it care ? &quot;
They feel good . &quot;
And you know what ? You are wrong .
Because it doesn &apos;t care , whether it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> that says , &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to give you a <unk> to what my experts are talking about . &quot;
or the other , or some <unk> that are patients with <unk>
Now , when you start with evidence and understanding the way that you don &apos;t want to go to believe that you didn &apos;t want to come out or get it to you .
Then you end up in the South African Africa of <unk> <unk> .
He &apos;s responsible for the death of 400,000 of his people to say that <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , more effective than the <unk> means able to slow down the progression of AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of thousands of deaths in a country that have more than anywhere else in the world .
Don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
They have them . They &apos;ve always got them .
Now this is the most pessimistic epidemic in which we &apos;re now , which is a absurd battle between <unk> of <unk> &apos;s , and the organic <unk> .
It &apos;s a crazy argument . It has to stop .
It &apos;s about words , metaphors .
It &apos;s ideology , not science .
Everything that we eat , every <unk> of rice , every <unk> <unk> , every <unk> <unk> , has changed by the human being .
Remember that he was in the &quot; <unk> paradise &quot; there was no <unk> .
There was no <unk> .
even not <unk> . They all come from us .
We created them in the last 11,000 years .
Some of those products stayed , and others didn &apos;t have it .
We <unk> us from what doesn &apos;t happen .
Now we can do the same way in a more targeted way .
And sure , there are risks to connect .
But we can produce rice vitamin A that means that there can be millions of healthier healthy healthier lives and longer lives .
You don &apos;t want to ?
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand .
We don &apos;t want to have genetically modified food .
And why ?
Well , this is all the time : too many of chemicals , pesticides , <unk> , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with the same crop , right ?
We don &apos;t like companies to take patents on living things .
We don &apos;t want companies to own property rights on seed .
And you know what I &apos;m answering ?
You have right . Let &apos;s do something .
It &apos;s true . Our <unk> is overwhelming , but that &apos;s not science .
It &apos;s not <unk> with science .
This is about laws , morality , patents .
Science is not a society .
No country .
even no idea ; it &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work .
But the idea that we have to stop the way of doing this , because it &apos;s going to work because we are afraid of <unk> and millions of people in the world to come to the world .
You know , in the next 50 years , we will need 70 percent more food than today .
Seventy percent .
This graph represents the progression of the investment in Africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
They really need it , and we all remember it .
And the reason ? <unk> food .
We don &apos;t want to use people like <unk> food for example , for example .
<unk> is the daily food of a half billion people ; it looks like some of the potatoes .
It &apos;s just a lot of calories . <unk> .
In fact , there &apos;s no use of nutrients like proteins , and scientists are engaged in doing something to do there .
so that people can eat without being blind .
They &apos;d no longer starve , and you know what ?
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be <unk> <unk> , but it would be nice .
And all the things I have is this : Why are we there ?
I mean , let &apos;s say , let &apos;s say , why are we there ?
Because we don &apos;t want to <unk> with genes ?
This is about the information ,
It &apos;s not true with our ridiculous passion for hormones , our demand for more , better and <unk> food .
It &apos;s not about Rice <unk> , it &apos;s about people in life .
And it &apos;s about how to understand what that means .
Because , you know , what ?
And if we don &apos;t do it and keep going on , we are guilty of something that we don &apos;t want to be guilty : high-tech colonialism .
Now , I don &apos;t find any other way to describe this .
It &apos;s <unk> and ugly , our <unk> , and we have to really do something like this .
So after this incredible <unk> <unk> , you might want to say , &quot; You want to travel with this ridiculous time ? &quot;
Absolutely . Sure .
Now , she &apos;s stuck in the present moment , but we have an amazing opportunity .
We can build it all the time we could use .
We can bring it to a future that we want , and we will go to it , and we go to where we want to .
We need to keep going on this <unk> , and we need to keep thinking , but if we go steps and forward , we &apos;ll be happy , we &apos;ll be happy .
I know we can do it , and that &apos;s what I have to do , in terms of the world .
Thank you .
Thank you .
a <unk> from the Los Angeles Times .
Steve <unk> was walking on a day
through downtown Los Angeles
when he heard wonderful music .
which came from a man .
a black man .
<unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> played on a violin , but two strings .
Now , I &apos;m telling you something that many of you already know
because the columns of Steve was the basis
for a book that was created .
Robert <unk> <unk> <unk> plays the role of Steve <unk>
Jamie <unk> that from <unk> Anthony <unk>
the classic educated <unk> --
that his career was going to break down ,
because he was dying of paranoid schizophrenia .
<unk> stopped using the <unk> ,
and then 30 years later he <unk>
by the poorest streets of Los Angeles .
You should have to read Steve &apos;s book or the movie .
not just for the beautiful band
that came between these two men .
but also to see what music played
a <unk> role , if I like that ,
to get <unk> from the street .
I met <unk> in 2008
Two years ago , in a <unk> .
He was listening to a performance from the art and Beethoven Symphony Symphonie
and came backstage .
He was talking on a <unk> and social way ,
about <unk> and Hillary Clinton .
<unk> said that the <unk> would never take the World Cup .
all of this <unk> <unk>
in the fourth part of the fourth symphony of Beethoven .
We talked about music
who wrote that <unk> was like a <unk> of me .
You have to know that <unk> shouldn &apos;t be treated .
when he was treated , he got <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
and it drew it to his life .
and the result is that it &apos;s
<unk> of schizophrenia .
in the worst attack
blows up .
and it goes away for days .
He <unk> over the street
and it lives with that <unk> and the disorder in his head
which is a lot of <unk> .
<unk> was in such a <unk> state
when we started with our first lesson .
He had a <unk> glow in his eyes .
He was lost .
He talked about
invisible demons and smoke
and someone who wanted him to poison him .
I was scared .
not for myself , I was scared
I &apos;d lost him
that he would <unk> in such a attack
and I would disrupt his relationship with the violin
when I started talking about <unk>
and other exciting examples .
from what you learn to <unk> .
So I started playing .
I played the first part of the Beethoven <unk> .
As I was playing
I saw a clear change
in the eyes of <unk> .
It was like if an invisible medicine was done .
a chemical reaction for which my game
was the catalyst ,
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>
in terms of understanding .
In silent , and <unk> .
As a wonder , he grabbed his own violin
and he started playing on playing .
Certain to <unk> --
which I had to finish up -- <unk>
<unk> , <unk> .
We started talking about music , from Bach
to Beethoven and <unk>
<unk> , all the B .
from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
I saw him not just
a <unk> musical idea had
but that it was really touched by that music .
He was talking about the same passion
and the same understanding when I and my colleagues ,
from the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
making music and talking about music
which was changed
from the paranoid ,
which is straight from the streets
from Los Angeles was
in a <unk> , <unk>
Brilliant , classical educated musician .
Music cures ,
for <unk> music .
because music can be his mind
and <unk> <unk>
through his imagination and creativity ,
in reality .
That &apos;s how he <unk>
are <unk> attacks .
and I saw that &apos;s the essential nature of art .
That &apos;s why we make music .
We take something that &apos;s all in us
deep in our heart .
Our emotions ,
And that &apos;s that through our artistic lens
through our <unk> , through emotions to reality ,
The reality of that expression ,
all of us all .
We become inspired , inspired ,
<unk>
got a group of friends back a group .
The <unk> power of music was bringing him back
in a family of musicians
who understood him
which are talents ,
and that he <unk> him .
I will always make music with <unk> .
whether it &apos;s in Walt Disney Hall ,
or on the street . He reminds me that
why I became a musician .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Robert <unk> .
I want to play a little bit of play out of <unk> .
forgive me .
I &apos;m Jane <unk> . I &apos;m a game designer .
For 10 years , I make online games .
And my goal for the next decade is to try to save it to save the world in real life as it &apos;s in games .
Now , I have this plan , and that &apos;s what more people , and more people , you all included , to spend more time on playing more time and better games .
Right now , in this moment , we spend three billion hours a week online .
Some of you probably think , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to play games . &quot;
Maybe too much time , because there are so many important problems in the real world to be able to solve .
But actually , in my research , I think , in my research , at the University of Science , it &apos;s the exact same thing that &apos;s true .
Three billion hours a week is not enough enough to solve the world &apos;s problems .
More recently , I believe that if we want to live on this planet on this planet , we have to increase that number .
And I &apos;ve calculated that we need to <unk> in nearly 21 billion hours per week .
That &apos;s probably a strange idea , so I &apos;ll say , so I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;ll leave it to you .
And if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global corruption , is obesity , I believe that we should try to play at least 21 billion hours online to play on the end of the decade .
This is the reason . This shot a fairly good thing , which is why games are so important for the future of humanity .
This is a portrait by a photographer , <unk> <unk> .
He wanted to collect the emotion of gaming .
So he put a camera on gamers as they played .
And this is a classic emotion with gaming .
Now , if you &apos;re not a gamer , you &apos;ll probably see some nuances in this picture .
And you probably see the feeling of pressure , a little bit of fear , but intense concentration , a deep focus to try to solve a very difficult problem .
Now , if you &apos;re a gamer , you &apos;ll notice some of the nuances : the <unk> around the eyes and mouth is a sign of optimism .
The eyebrows came up with his surprise .
This is a gamer talking to something called a <unk> win .
Ah , you know , you know . All right .
So we have a couple of gamers among us .
A &quot; <unk> win &quot; is a product that &apos;s so incredibly positive , you don &apos;t know that it was possible until you reach it to you .
It was almost not simple .
And when you &apos;re there , you &apos;re surprised to discover what you can . That &apos;s a <unk> win .
This is a gamer at making a <unk> win .
And this is the face that we have to see over millions of prayer throughout the world as we try to tackle the barriers of the next century .
The face of someone who is , at the end of all , at the point , at the point , is a <unk> win .
But unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing this face in everyday life as we try to tackle pressing problems .
This is what I &apos;m doing : &quot; I &apos;m not good in life . &quot;
And this is what I &apos;m doing . Can you see it ? Yes .
This one , I &apos;m not saying I &apos;m not good in life .
This is a lot of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley , California , where I was in my PhD , why I was doing better in games than in real life .
And this is a problem which has many gamers .
We feel that we &apos;re not equally good in reality as we are in games .
And I mean , I don &apos;t just mean by good success , even though it &apos;s part of it .
We &apos;re going to see more in games . But I mean , I mean , but I mean , I &apos;m motivated to do something that counts , inspired by to work together .
And when we &apos;re in a game in a game , I believe that most of us are the best version of ourselves , the most likely , to help .
the most likely , for so long as long as it needs to stay at a time , to try to try to go back to a failure .
And when we &apos;re in the real life of a failure , when we are facing obstacles , we don &apos;t feel like this .
We feel the way we feel . We feel overwhelmed .
We feel anxious , perhaps depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
We never have those feelings when we play games .
They just don &apos;t exist in games .
So that &apos;s what I wanted to study when I was a college student .
What is a part of games , which makes it impossible that we can &apos;t feel anything ?
How can we take those feelings of games and apply it to work in the real world ?
So , I looked at games like Warcraft or Warcraft , so that &apos;s the appropriate cooperative environment to solve problems .
And I started to notice some of these things that are able to make a <unk> win in the online world .
The first one that I noticed is that every time you go into one of those online games , especially World of Warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that you &apos;d like to think about , right ?
But not just a mission , a mission that &apos;s completely adapted to your level of your level . Right ?
So you can do it .
They never give you a challenge to you .
But it &apos;s the limits of your possibilities . So you have to try hard .
But there &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft .
You can &apos;t stand anywhere .
There &apos;s always been something specific and important that must be done .
And there are also lots of <unk> .
Every place where you go , there are hundreds and thousands of thousands of people who are willing to help create your epic mission .
That &apos;s something that we have in the real life , that feel that there are very many collaborators .
And also , there &apos;s a <unk> story , this is inspiring story , this tells us why we are here and what we &apos;re doing .
And then all of the positive feedback we get .
You know , you &apos;ve heard of a level of <unk> and <unk> strength , and <unk> intelligence .
Sun &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is in the real life .
Now , when I <unk> this podium , I &apos;m not going to be able to talk a message from <unk> , crazy idea , crazy idea .
Such feedback , I &apos;m not in real life .
Now , the problem with collaborative worlds , like World of World or Warcraft , is that it &apos;s so fulfilling about the <unk> win on a <unk> win , which is that we decide to spend all our time online .
It &apos;s just better than the reality .
Now , up until now , World of Warcraft , they &apos;ve spent all these together <unk> million years to put together the virtual problems of <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s not necessarily something .
It sounds bad .
To try to make it clear : <unk> million years ago , our first human flight ,
That was the first , <unk> Primat .
Okay , so , so if we talk about the amount of time we invest in games , it &apos;s the only way that it &apos;s a sense of how it &apos;s actually going to talk a long time in the context of human evolution , which is a really extraordinary thing .
But it &apos;s also good . Because it turns out that we spend so much time playing games with games , but it &apos;s actually going to change the way we humans ,
We evolve to a species that &apos;s more cooperative and true .
This is true . I believe this .
So , think about this interesting number .
It was published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University recently .
The average young person today , in a country with a cultural game , is going to have 10,000 hours already have spent 10,000 hours going to have spent the age of 21 years .
Now , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
First of all , for kids in the United States , <unk> hours is the exact amount of time you <unk> at school from the age of the fifth <unk> until you &apos;re always present .
So , we have a <unk> track of education where young kids are learning a lot about games like they all over the rest of the school .
Some of you may have heard about <unk> <unk> &apos;s book &quot; <unk> . &quot;
So you &apos;ve probably heard of his <unk> hearing , the 10,000 hours of <unk> .
It &apos;s on this amazing , cognitive science research study that says that if we can control 10,000 hours in terms of the <unk> , in terms of the fact that we &apos;re going to be in the 21st century ,
We &apos;ll be good at what we &apos;re doing as the best of the world .
And so , what we &apos;re seeing now is a whole generation of kids who are <unk> in gaming .
So , the big question is , &quot; Where are gamers going so good ? &quot;
Because if we can figure out that , we would have a virtual space range of human potential to human potential .
This is the number of people who are currently in the world at least one hour online playing video games .
These are our <unk> .
500 million people are doing extremely well in something .
And in the next decade , we &apos;ll have another more positive gamers that &apos;s going to be extremely good at something .
But if you don &apos;t know it , this is .
The <unk> is <unk> to develop a little stream and with wireless <unk> , instead of Internet Internet , so that gamers of all around the world , especially in India , China and Brazil can play online .
They expect a billion gamers over the next decade .
That brings us to 1.5 billion gamers .
So , I asked myself , what &apos;s going on through these games ,
I &apos;ve found four things . The first is <unk> optimism .
Okay . This can be seen as extreme <unk> .
<unk> optimism is that it &apos;s just to act on action , to grab a hurdle , combined with the belief that we have a reasonable chance of success .
<unk> believe that a &quot; <unk> win &quot; is possible , and it &apos;s it &apos;s worth trying to try to try to , and then try to try to .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> in the <unk> of a dense social material .
Now , there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that it turns out that we &apos;d rather have people after we played a game with them , even though it &apos;s all the time .
The reason is that you need trust with someone playing a game .
We trust them with our time , which they &apos;ll be able to play with the same rules , which is the same goal , that they &apos;ll stay against the game .
So , a game with someone who promotes the communication , it &apos;s trust and collaboration .
And as a result , we &apos;re actually building stronger social bonds .
<unk> productivity . Awesome .
You know , there &apos;s a reason that the average World of Warcraft is playing 22 hours a week playing 22 hours a week .
That &apos;s because we know that when we play a game , we are actually happier to work hard than if we <unk> or <unk> somewhere .
We know that when people are made to hard work , useful work .
And gamers are ready to work hard , when they get the right work ,
And eventually epic meaning .
<unk> are like <unk> missions to <unk> missions , to stories of planetary scales .
So , a little <unk> to make it clearer to make it clearer .
You know , you all know Wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
The second largest wiki channels in the world , with nearly 80,000 articles , is the World of Warcraft .
Five million people spend it every month .
They &apos;ve put more <unk> over World of Warcraft to put together on the Internet , than any other subject are being treated by another <unk> .
They &apos;re building a <unk> story .
They &apos;re building a <unk> source of knowledge about World of Warcraft .
So , there are four superpowers that are combined with one thing .
<unk> are <unk> , hopeful individually .
These are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world .
And the only problem is that they believe it are capable of changing virtual worlds , not the real world .
That &apos;s the problem I try to solve .
There &apos;s a econoom , there &apos;s Edward <unk> .
His work is brilliant . He &apos;s very good . It &apos;s why people spend so much time and money online .
And he says , &quot; You know , we are not witnesses to any more than a real mass of virtual worlds and online <unk> . &quot;
And it &apos;s a econoom , so it &apos;s rational .
And he says -- not like me , I &apos;m a game designer ; I &apos;m <unk> .
But he says that this is all right , because gamers can be more capable in an online world than in real life .
They can have stronger social relationships in games than in real life .
They get better feedback , and they feel more rewarded in games than in real time .
So he says that it &apos;s perfect logical that gamers in virtual worlds , in virtual worlds than in the real world .
Now , I &apos;m also going to agree that &apos;s rational , right ?
But it &apos;s not an optimum situation .
We need to have the real world more like this .
So , I take my inspiration from something 2,500 years ago .
These are ancient grapes .
Before we had some good controllers , we had <unk> .
And this opens up the first piece of tool to play , designed by people .
And if you know the work of the ancient Greek historian , you know , you know , maybe this story .
the inventors of the first game , and why they invented it .
<unk> says that games , mostly they came up with dice , invented in the Kingdom of a famine .
Apparently , the famine was so very , very , very , very , very , very , <unk> decided to do something .
People <unk> . People <unk> .
It was an extreme situation . They had to find an extreme solution .
So , you say , <unk> , they invented <unk> and <unk> a <unk> .
One day , everybody eats .
The next day , everybody &apos;s playing games ,
And they would be so immersed in their play , because they are so interesting , because they are so interesting , and in such a <unk> productivity , they would have no food .
The next day , they played games .
The next soon they ate it .
And according to <unk> , it was all about 18 years .
She survived a famine by eating one day and playing the next day .
Now , I think this is exactly how we use games today .
We use games to the <unk> of the real world .
We use them to escape from all the broken thing in the world , all the stuff that &apos;s not fulfilling , and it &apos;s what &apos;s not fulfilling .
But that doesn &apos;t have to end up .
This is very exciting .
After 18 years , after 18 years old , it was not better .
So , the king decided to play it with another <unk> .
They shared the whole kingdom in two .
And they played one <unk> , and the winners of that play could be a <unk> adventure .
They were going to leave behind <unk> , looking for a new living town .
Just enough people continued to survive from the food that were still there , and hopefully they could grow the civilization somewhere else .
Now this sounds crazy , right ?
But recently , DNA evidence showed that the <unk> , they would lead to the <unk> realm , the same DNA as the ancient <unk> .
So , scientists have suggested that crazy story is crazy story .
And geologists have found evidence of one climate change that nearly 20 years ago would explain the famine .
So this crazy story could be true .
And it could be that they could have saved their culture through games , because it could come to a game for 18 years , and so inspired by to be so inspired by video games , and so so much of it all over the world .
Okay , so we can also .
We play Warcraft since in 1994 .
It was the first real game of World or Warcraft . That was 16 years ago .
And they played , they played over 18 years , we play Warcraft for 16 years .
And I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
Now , they left half of the population looking for a new world .
So that &apos;s where I can <unk> my 21 billion hours a week .
We &apos;ll spend half of our reference to play an hour a day , until we solve problems in the real world .
Now , I know what you &apos;re asking : How are we going to play these problems ? &quot; Well , that &apos;s where I &apos;ve spent my work on the last couple years , at night , at night , at night .
We have a <unk> in our house in Palo Alto , and it expresses our view of how to deal with the future .
We don &apos;t want to predict him .
We want to shape it .
We want to imagine the best outcome .
And then we want to give people the power to create that outcome .
We want to think of our <unk> wins , and then humans give the resources to win their <unk> win .
Now , I &apos;ll show you briefly just three games that I made you think about , and I &apos;m going to give you a try to create the tools to create their own life in the future .
Okay , this is World Without Oil .
We created this game in 2007 .
This is a online game where you try to survive a <unk> of oil .
The <unk> is <unk> , but we put enough content online to make you believe that it &apos;s true , and to keep your life alive , so if you don &apos;t have a oil anymore , you actually , you know , what you live with .
And then we put your <unk> in real time , and it feeds you to what &apos;s the exact price of oil , what &apos;s not available , how the <unk> are affected , how <unk> are affected , whether in schools are <unk> , whether there are riots .
And you &apos;ve got to figure out how to live your real life as this was true . And then we ask you to go to a blog about video and photos .
We started this game with <unk> players in 2007 .
And we followed them for three years .
And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
No one wants to change lifestyle , but because it &apos;s good for the world , because it &apos;s good for the world ,
But if you <unk> them in an <unk> adventure , and she says , &quot; You don &apos;t have any oil . &quot;
This is a great story and adventure to go .
<unk> yourself to see how you could survive .
Most players loved their habits they were in this game .
So , for example , for the next <unk> game , we decided to go higher , larger problems than an oil spill .
We created a game called <unk> at the Institute for <unk> .
The thing was that a supercomputer had calculated that a supercomputer was just 23 years on Earth .
This supercomputer had called the Global <unk> <unk> System .
We asked people to come online , almost like a Jerry <unk> film .
You know , Jerry <unk> movies , you know , is a <unk> team .
You know , you have the astronaut , the scientist , the <unk> , and they have to save the world .
But in our game , we have instead of five people on the <unk> , everybody on the <unk> , and it &apos;s your job to find the future of energy , the future of food , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of social networking .
We left 8,000 people playing game over eight weeks .
They came up with 500 creative solutions that you can see when you look at Google &apos;s <unk> .
And then finally , the last game , we &apos;ll take him out on March three ,
As you go through the game , you &apos;re going to be certified by the World Bank Institute of the World Bank , as a Social Progress , grade by 2010 .
<unk> with universities across very <unk> Africa , and we invite them to teach them to teach social innovation skills .
We have a <unk> . We have a set of skills in abilities like local insight , knowledge , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
Now , I &apos;d like to invite you all this game to share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , especially in <unk> , that may benefit from the meeting , to create their own social endeavors to save the world .
So now , I &apos;m going to wrap up now .
I want to ask a question .
What do you think , right ?
We have all these great gamers , we have these games that are ideas of what we could do , but none of them have the real world .
Well , I hope that you agree with me , that you agree with me , that &apos;s a human resource , we can use the real world , that games are a powerful platform for change .
We have all this incredible superpower , <unk> productivity , the ability to <unk> a dense , social material , this sense of processing , and desire for a epic meaning .
And I really hope that we can come together to play games to play that , to make a difference , on this planet .
And my hope is that you &apos;ll come to me and play games like this .
And if I look forward to the next decade , I know two things that I &apos;m sure every future , that we can shape every future we can imagine , and that we can play every game we want .
So , I &apos;m telling you , let &apos;s play the game .
Thank you .
Now I &apos;m interested in the <unk> .
That may seem strange to a magician , unless you hear about that same meaning as I , which is something that is fake , so you believed that it &apos;s true . &quot; In other words , <unk> effect has a measurable effect in certain studies : <unk> .
Just because the person in question is , what it happens is that what it happens to him is that it happens to be something else .
In terms of pain , for example , when you think about that , if you believe that , if you believe , it &apos;s a measurable physical effect , it &apos;s <unk> .
Something that &apos;s fake , it &apos;s really , because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
To make sure that we understand each other , I want to begin to show you a very simple <unk> .
And I &apos;ll show you how it works . This is a trick of the 50 in every museum in every <unk> of children .
I learned him as little boy in the <unk> in the 1970s .
I &apos;ll just take the trick , then I &apos;ll put it out .
And then I explain why I explained it .
This is what happens .
The knife , you can see , my hand , you can see .
I &apos;m going to hold the blade on this way .
I &apos;ll take my sleeve some <unk> .
And to be sure there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , I &apos;m going to squeeze it in my wrist .
So you can see there &apos;s no movement .
So for example , I &apos;m so long there , there can be nothing in and out of my sleeve .
The goal is very simple .
I will open my hand , and hopefully , if it &apos;s good , my magnetism will take the knife .
The knife is so solid so solid , which I can shake it and it &apos;s the blade of grass .
Nothing comes out of my sleeve , no deception . And you can just watch all the way out .
<unk> !
This trick , I &apos;m often learning about young kids who are interested in <unk> , because you can learn a lot about deception by studying it .
Even while the trick is very simple ,
Probably many of you know this trick .
This is what happens .
I love the knife in my hand .
I &apos;m saying I <unk> my wrist , to make sure it &apos;s nothing in and out of my sleeve .
That &apos;s lied .
The reason I <unk> my wrist is because it &apos;s the secret of the illusion .
At the moment that my hand , my view of your vision , is to shift your <unk> site to one which he &apos;s so <unk> .
beautiful little .
So this is how it &apos;s going to go .
And when I <unk> me , my finger moves .
We can talk about why this thing is , why you don &apos;t notice that there are just three fingers ,
That &apos;s because the brain processes information in a way that it &apos;s not one , two , three counts , but <unk> .
But there &apos;s no real matter , right ? And then I &apos;m going to open my hand .
Of course , the knife there doesn &apos;t take the magnetism wrong , but through deception , through the presence of my <unk> <unk> .
And when I <unk> my hand , the same thing .
And when I <unk> me back , this movement allows me to pull back and pull back .
I take this hand . You reach the blade .
A nice trick that you can do for friends and family . Thank you .
Now what does this relate to doing ?
About a year ago , I was reading a study of my eyes completely opened up .
I &apos;m not a scientist , so for me , this was amazing .
It turns out that if you give a placebo in the form of a white round pill that looks like a <unk> , it has a certain measurable effect .
<unk> , when the shape of the placebo , for example , to make a smaller pill , it will shape blue , and where you then can press a letter , becomes more powerful .
Despite the fact , despite the fact that there &apos;s no sense of <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
But a white pill is not so good as a blue one .
What ? That was me blown away from the upside .
But it turns out , it can <unk> .
It turns out that <unk> are more effective than any species <unk> .
A colored capsule , yellow on one and red , is better than a white .
<unk> plays a role in this .
A pill twice every day is not as good as three <unk> <unk> I can &apos;t remember the statistics , sorry .
But the point is
<unk> play plays a role .
And the shape plays a role .
And for the ultimate <unk> , we have to go to the needle .
Yes , right ? A <unk> with some kind of <unk> of a kind of <unk> of a kind of inert object that you put into a patient --
This is a hugely powerful picture in his mind .
It &apos;s many times stronger than the white pill .
We &apos;ll show you this graph , when we can show slides .
The point is , the white pill is not so good as the blue , not as well as the capsule , not as well as the needle .
And none of all has a <unk> trait .
And just one of your beliefs in your body , and creates a stronger effect .
I wanted to look at that idea in a trick .
Now , I want to take something that &apos;s clear a trick and it really make it seem like .
We know that research that when you want to go to reality , you need to take to the needle .
This is a blade of 18 inches . She &apos;s <unk> .
I &apos;m going to take her a little <unk> here .
This is actually my flesh . This is not a <unk> meat .
This is my skin . This is not a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> my skin , and I &apos;m going to put this needle through my arm , until I <unk> through .
If you <unk> <unk> or if you were to <unk> -- I did this trick for a few friends , and I did not know exactly what I didn &apos;t know .
One woman walked into her field .
So , I &apos;m suggesting that if you &apos;re <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and I &apos;m doing the first heavy part of it .
You can look , but also look away ,
This is what happens .
Down my arm , I make a little hole .
Oh , sorry , you ?
Then , even by my skin , a bit , and then the other direction .
Now , in essence , we are in the same situation as with the <unk> .
It &apos;s a species .
But you can count my fingers , right ?
I show them . Here &apos;s one , two , three , four , five .
Yes ,
I know people when they &apos;re seeing this .
They think , &quot; He &apos;s not stupid enough enough to <unk> himself for a few minutes . &quot;
What does that look like ? Pretty good .
Yes , I know . The people in the back of this room are saying , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see . &quot; People in this room are going to be closer to the screen .
Let me show you this from nearby .
That &apos;s my skin . That &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s my flesh . I can rotate this pin .
Sorry . If it &apos;s too much , look , look away and don &apos;t go to that thing .
People in the back of this room , or people later , are going to look at the images like this , and if it really was like a beautiful special effect , but if it really was true , there &apos;s a hole and there would be a , if it would . If it would .
Yes , there &apos;s this .
Normally , I &apos;d like to remove the needle .
I would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
But in this context , and with the idea of something that fake fake , and it &apos;s really making it , I &apos;m just going to sit on the needle and come up with this stage .
In the next couple of days , I &apos;ll tell you several times .
Hopefully , you look at it . Thank you so much .
I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I &apos;ve got just two to two .
The first one was a passionate <unk> .
It was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good structure , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What a fish .
Better yet , it was <unk> <unk> to the highest standards of sustainability .
So you felt good at selling .
I had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
One day , I called the head of the company , and I asked , if I wanted to speak at an event ,
&quot; Absolutely . &quot;
Here was a company trying to solve something , which was this incredible problem for our <unk> problem .
How do we keep looking at our menu ?
In the last 50 years , in the last 50 years , we have <unk> forests .
It &apos;s hard to exaggerate the devastation .
90 percent of the big fish that we like , who we love , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they have collapsed .
There &apos;s almost nothing left .
So how well , how well it is , how bad it is , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , is going to be part of our future .
even though there are lots of arguments to be .
<unk> pollute , most of them , at least , are inefficient .
A big <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> of 15 to one .
That means he needed 15 pounds of a big pound of fish to get a pound of tuna .
Not very sustainable .
And it doesn &apos;t taste very good .
So here was finally a business I tried to do .
I wanted to support them .
The day for the event , I called the <unk> .
Let &apos;s call it Don &apos;t call it .
&quot; Don &apos;t tell me , &quot; I said to you , &quot; You know , you know , you know , because of the way you grow up in the ocean , you don &apos;t pollute . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s right . &quot;
And he added , &quot; We are in fact in fact in a <unk> .
The <unk> ? Two . Two .
Two and a half .
&quot; Two to one what ? What do you feed ? &quot;
<unk> proteins , he said .
&quot; Great . &quot;
And that night , I was in bed , and I thought , what is an renewable protein ?
So next day , right before the event I called Don <unk> .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t be examples of sustainable <unk> ? &quot;
He said he didn &apos;t know it .
So I &apos;ve been on the line with some people in the company .
No one was able to answer me to .
until I finally got the <unk> on the line .
Don &apos;t mention it .

All right , he called some algae and some <unk> , and then he said to <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yes , feathers , skin , <unk> bones , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> to feed . &quot;
I said , &quot; What percentage of your food feed ? &quot;
Thinking , oh , two percent .
&quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have to feed on chicken ? &quot;
There was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
My love for this fish was about .
No , not because I &apos;m a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s me .
No , I lost my love for this fish because , I swear , after that , I swear to chicken --
This other fish , which is a very different story .
It &apos;s the romantic species , sort of , as you know more of your fish , is the more of your fish .
Let me go to him for the first time in a restaurant in <unk> .
A <unk> journalist was talking about this fish .
It &apos;s more or more <unk> .
He came to the table , a bright , <unk> color .
The chef had to cook it .
Almost twice ,
It was pretty good .
Who can do a fish so well after he cooked <unk> cooking ?
I don &apos;t , but this guy .
Let &apos;s call him Miguel .
Actually , his name is Miguel .
And no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish and it &apos;s not a chef .
At least in the way you and I understand .
He &apos;s a biologist in <unk> La <unk> .
That &apos;s a <unk> in the <unk> of Spain .
On the tip of the <unk> river .
Up until the 1980s were the <unk> of <unk> .
They ate beef cattle in a way .
They did that by <unk> the country .
They built a complex <unk> , and they <unk> the water off the river .
It didn &apos;t work , not economically .
And it was seen ecological disaster .
Ninety percent of birds were dead .
What , this is , for this site , are many birds .
And so now , in 1982 , a Spanish firm called the Country Company .
What did they do ?
They <unk> the <unk> .
They literally can literally put the button .
Instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to water in it .
They put the channels under water .
They created a <unk> <unk> big <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and at the same time , there are Miguel and its firm completely <unk> .
The <unk> is great .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this before .
You look at the horizon that are infinitely far away , and you can see everywhere there are <unk> channels and this thick , rich swamp .
Not so long ago I was there with Miguel .
He &apos;s a wonderful guy , three , three years , and one quarter of <unk> <unk> .
Okay ? Here we are , <unk> through the <unk> , I <unk> and <unk> , mud , <unk> , and Miguel <unk> is a <unk> .
Here &apos;s a rare <unk> <unk> .
Now , it points on the <unk> of the phytoplankton .
And here , here , he sees a <unk> <unk> <unk> thinking .
So it turns out that Miguel was the most part of his career in the <unk> National Park in Africa .
I asked him how it has become a <unk> .
He said , &quot; <unk> ? I don &apos;t know of fish .
I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot;
And then he was talking about rare birds , and algae and strange <unk> .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong , it was really fascinating , sort of a biological community .
It was amazing , but I was in love .
And my head <unk> at the <unk> <unk> that I had had the night before .
So I <unk> it . I said , &quot; Miguel , how is it going to taste your fish so right ? &quot;
He pointed to the algae .
&quot; I know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the phytoplankton , and it &apos;s great .
But what &apos;s eating the fish ?
What &apos;s the <unk> ? &quot;
Then he &apos;s going to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system , which is what they eat in the wild ,
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the phytoplankton , which feeds the fish .
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
There &apos;s no food .
ever heard from a farm which doesn &apos;t run her animals ?
That day , I was driving over this terrain with Miguel , and I said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s a place that looks natural like , &quot; which I &apos;ve ever had , &quot; How measure your success ? &quot;
At that moment , it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we went to the corner and saw the most amazing face , thousands and thousands of pink <unk> <unk> , literally a pink carpet that you could look at .
&quot; That &apos;s success . &quot;
&quot; Look at their <unk> , pink .
They are <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? I was completely confused .
I said , &quot; Miguel , are they not on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> of birds .
Last year , this area had 600,000 birds , over 250 different species .
It &apos;s the largest one , and one of the most important private parts of Europe has become a big fan of Europe . &quot;
I said , &quot; Miguel , is a <unk> that doesn &apos;t really make the last thing ? &quot;
He shook his head , no .
He said , &quot; We grow <unk> , not intense .
This is an ecological network .
The <unk> &apos;s food eats the shrimp .
The shrimp eats the phytoplankton .
So how to <unk> the <unk> , the better system . &quot;
Okay , let &apos;s look back .
A <unk> that are animals don &apos;t run , and a <unk> who is successfully obtained by the <unk> of his predators .
A <unk> , but also a <unk> .
Oh , and by the way , and by the way , the <unk> , which shouldn &apos;t be .
They breed in a town &apos;s area of 250 kilometers away , where the <unk> are better to build nests .
Every morning they fly 250 kilometers to the <unk> .
And every night , they fly back 250 kilometers .
They &apos;re doing that because they can follow the white white line of the highway .
No joke .
So , I proposed a <unk> , so I looked at Miguel .
I said , &quot; Miguel , they go to 250 kilometers to the <unk> and then go back 250 kilometers back ?
Do they do that for the young ? &quot;
He looked at me just as if I just had a Whitney <unk> <unk> .
He said , &quot; No . They &apos;re better . &quot;
I haven &apos;t mentioned the skin of my beloved fish , which was amazing , and I don &apos;t like <unk> .
I don &apos;t love it . I don &apos;t love it .
It &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> flavor .
I rarely <unk> it .
But when I tasted it in that restaurant in <unk> , it didn &apos;t taste all over <unk> .
He tasted fresh and clean , like you took a bite from the ocean .
I said that at Miguel and <unk> .
He said , &quot; The skin acts as a <unk> .
It &apos;s the last defense before something the body <unk> .
It &apos;s evolved to suck up <unk> . &quot;
And then he added , &quot; But our water doesn &apos;t have <unk> . &quot;
Okay . A <unk> that &apos;s not running fish .
A <unk> that is successfully measuring its success in its predators .
And then I realized that when he said , if he said , a <unk> didn &apos;t have a <unk> , he made a big <unk> because water comes out of the <unk> river .
That &apos;s a river that &apos;s from all over the place in the world today , and chemical <unk> , pesticide use .
And while it &apos;s gone through the system and <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s the water <unk> than when it came to it .
The system is so healthy it &apos;s so healthy .
So it &apos;s not just a <unk> that are animals not run , not just a <unk> that are successfully apart from its predators , but a <unk> that &apos;s literally a <unk> .
And not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
Because when it comes to water , it &apos;s in the Atlantic Ocean .
A drop in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;m going to take it , and you should also want to go , because this is the story , although romantic , also .
You can say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or cattle .
So what we need is a <unk> new <unk> , one which actually actually tastes good .
But for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
We are not <unk> , we <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We love <unk> .
We like little <unk> .
We talk about local food .
We eat organic .
And if you suggests that these are the things that are the future of good food , but it always says , &quot; He , I love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
How are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
Can I be fair ?
I don &apos;t like this question .
No , not because we now produce more than enough <unk> to feed the world .
One billion people today are hungry .
One billion -- which is more than ever before -- because of the big inequality in distribution countries , not the amount .
I don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s because it &apos;s based on the logic of our food system in the last 50 years .
<unk> grain to <unk> crops , pesticide use of <unk> , and chicken farms , and all the <unk> has just asked , &quot; If we feed more people , how much could it be ?
That &apos;s the motivation .
It &apos;s the <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> of American <unk> .
We should call it what it is , a endeavor in <unk> , which is a firm undertaking to make ecological capital , which is to make it possible .
That &apos;s not a business , and it &apos;s not <unk> .
Our daily bread now is threatened today , not by declining supply , but through <unk> sources , not by the last <unk> and <unk> water , not through pumps , but by water , not by <unk> , but by <unk> water , not by <unk> and nets , but by sea .
Do you want to feed the world ?
Let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
Or better , how can we create conditions where every community can feed itself ?
To do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
It &apos;s old , and it &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of money , <unk> and machines , and it doesn &apos;t really have a good thing to eat .
Let &apos;s look , instead of looking at the ecological model .
That &apos;s the model that you rely on in two billion years of <unk> experience .
Look at Miguel , <unk> like Miguel , <unk> that are not your own <unk> , <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> , <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> , but experts in relationships are not only producers , but experts in relationships , because they &apos;re the experts in flavors .
And if I &apos;m very fair , they &apos;re a better chef than I ever will .
You know , I think it &apos;s fine , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s all right .
Thank you .
I grew up on a constant diet of science fiction .
In my continued education , I was going to go to school , I went back to school and back every day .
And I was always absorbed by a book , a science fiction book , which me in mind brought into other worlds , and that , in <unk> sense , my <unk> curiosity , <unk> curiosity .
And , you know , this curiosity <unk> itself into the fact that I always had when I was not at school , I was in the forest , <unk> and frogs , frogs , snakes , and <unk> , and it took them back to the microscope .
You know , I was a real <unk> .
But it all came to understand the world , the frontiers of understanding .
And my love for science fiction seemed to be <unk> in the world around me , because what happened , this was the end of the <unk> , we were going to go to the moon , we were the deep ocean , and our <unk> was able to see our <unk> <unk> , and places like that , in fact , and a <unk> world that we never had really allowed us to really <unk> .
This seemed to <unk> with the whole science fiction aspect of it .
And I was an artist .
I was able to draw . I could paint painting .
And because there were no video games , and this <unk> of <unk> movies , and all these pictures in the media landscape , I had to create these pictures .
You know , we all had to be able to read , as kids could read a book and based on the description of the author in our heads .
And my response was to paint , painting alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , <unk> , all kinds of things .
I was constantly caught when I was caught in <unk> <unk> .
That was the creativity that had to find a way .
And something interesting happened , the Jacques Cousteau programs , made me very excited about the fact that there was a alien world , just on Earth .
I &apos;m not going to really go to an alien world at a time in a space .
That seemed pretty unlikely .
But that was a world where I could just go to the Earth , which was so rich and exotic and exotic as all that I had , by reading those books .
So , I decided to become a diver at 15 years old .
And the only problem that I lived in a small village in Canada , 600 miles from the nearest ocean .
But I didn &apos;t take it away from <unk> .
And I was <unk> at my father until finally he found a <unk> at Buffalo , New York , just about the border of where we lived .
And I got a certificate of <unk> , in a swimming pool , in the middle of winter , in Buffalo , New York .
And I saw the ocean , a real ocean , not until two years later , when we moved to California .
Since then , in the <unk> 40 years , I have spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and there was 500 hours in submarines .
And I learned that the deep environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with wonderful life that it really is really our imagination .
The imagination of nature is so limitless , compared to our limited , human imagination .
Up until this day , I have this amazing awe for what I see in these dives .
And my ongoing love for ocean waters is just as much as they ever had .
But when I chose a career , this was a filmmaker .
And that seemed to be the best way , that I had to tell you how to communicate , to try to create images .
And as a child , I was doing something like <unk> , etc .
So movies was how to bring images and stories together . And that seemed so much .
And of course , the stories that I chose to tell you , Science fiction stories : &quot; Terminator . &quot;
And with &quot; The <unk> &quot; , I brought my love for underwater and diving , along with movies .
Tell me , the two passions .
Another interesting thing came out of &quot; The <unk> , &quot; which is to try to solve a particular <unk> problem in that movie , creating a kind of liquid water creature , that &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And this led to the first soft <unk> character , <unk> animation that was in a movie .
And even though the movie never ran away , it didn &apos;t really have to <unk> me , which I was witnessing something extraordinary , that it was that the audience , the global audience , was <unk> by this <unk> magic .
You know , you know , it &apos;s Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , which is all the advanced technology that &apos;s not too different from magic .
They saw something magical .
And I became very excited .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , this is something that should be <unk> in the <unk> . &quot;
So with &quot; <unk> 2 &quot; , what my second movie was , we went to this .
<unk> with <unk> , we created the <unk> <unk> in that movie . The success depended on whether that would work .
And that &apos;s what it did . And we created the magic .
And we had the same result with the audience .
We made a little more money on that movie .
So , to draw a line between those two points of experience , it led to , this is a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
So so , I started a company with <unk> Winston , my good friend <unk> Winston , who was the chief <unk> and <unk> in that time , and it was called Digital <unk> .
And the idea of the project was that we would take a leap , over the analog processes of optical printers and such , and we would go to digital production .
And that &apos;s what we did , and it gave us a temporary advantage .
But we found ourselves in the <unk> , in the mid- &apos; 90s , in the <unk> , in the <unk> and <unk> , which we originally had originally founded .
So , I wrote this piece called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which means that there was no way of measuring the frontiers of visual effects , of <unk> effects , by <unk> human emotional characters in <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> would all be in <unk> .
And I was told by the people in my firm , that we can &apos;t yet be able to be able to do this .
So , I put it in the fridge , and I made this other movie about a big boat that goes down .
I sold it to the studio like , &quot; Romeo and Juliet . &quot;
It &apos;s a epic romantic , passionate movie .
What I was looking for was to be able to go to the real <unk> of the Titanic .
And that &apos;s why I made the movie .
And that &apos;s true . However , the studio didn &apos;t know .
But I convinced them . I said , &quot; We go to the <unk> dive . We &apos;re going to go to it .
We &apos;ll use it in the opening of the movie .
It &apos;s going to be very important . It will be a great <unk> .
A I convinced them to fund it an expedition .
Sounds crazy . But this comes back to the theme of your imagination that creates a reality .
Because , because we created a reality where I found six months later in a Russian submersible , two and a half miles deep , in the north of the Atlantic Ocean looking at the real Titanic by a <unk> , not a movie ; it &apos;s not high-definition .
I was just amazed by that .
And it took a lot of preparation , we had to develop cameras and lights and all sorts of things .
But it struck me how much this dive , these deep dives in <unk> diving .
And you know , there &apos;s a very technical thing , and it required a huge planning .
You go into a capsule , and you &apos;re going down into this dark environment , where there &apos;s no hope of the rescue that you can &apos;t go back with .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , it looks like I live in a Science Fiction .
This is very cool .
So , I had the taste of exploring the deep ocean ,
Of course , the curiosity , the <unk> .
It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was an experience that I could not give you to me .
Because , you know , you could just imagine , and we could create a visual effect . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I saw from that window .
And as we did some of our next expeditions , I saw creatures with hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before and some other things that nobody had ever seen before , who did not actually have the science at the moment that we saw them and <unk> them .
So , I was doing this because of this , and I had to be able to do this .
And so I made some strange decision .
After the success of &quot; Titanic . &quot;
And so we started to plan these expeditions .
And we ended up going to the <unk> , and we explored with robotic vehicles .
We went back to the <unk> of the Titanic .
We took little <unk> that we had created that <unk> <unk> .
And the idea was to go inside and try to do a <unk> research of that ship , which was never done before .
No one had ever looked at the <unk> . They didn &apos;t have the tools to do it , so we developed technology to do it .
So , here I am , on the deck of the Titanic , <unk> in a submersible , and look out , look out , that &apos;s a lot like this , where I knew that it had played .
And I <unk> a little <unk> by a vessel .
When I tell him that I &apos;m wearing it , I was in the vehicle , in the vehicle , I felt like I was physically in the <unk> of the Titanic .
And it was the most spectacular kind of <unk> species I ever had , because I had a corner , because I knew what would be there , for the lights of the vehicle , it actually showed up , because I had spent months on the set of <unk> on the set , when we were making a film .
And it was like the set of <unk> on the blueprints of the vessel .
So this was an absolutely remarkable experience .
And it made me realize that the <unk> experience , that you can have this type of robotic <unk> , where you can <unk> your consciousness in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
It was really quite profound .
And perhaps a little bit of a look at what could happen , a few decades later , as &quot; <unk> &quot; available to exploration or other goals , in many forms <unk> <unk> , which I can imagine as a science fiction fan .
So these expeditions have done and really really beginning to appreciate what was there down there , like in the deep ocean , where we had these amazing incredible animals .
They are basically the kind of alien creatures just on Earth .
They live in an environment of <unk> .
They don &apos;t live in an sunlight based on how to do that .
And so you can see animals that live next to 500 degrees Fahrenheit warmer .
You might think that it could be impossible .
At the same time , I was also very interested in looking very interested in <unk> , again , again , science fiction as a child .
And I got involved in the <unk> , very involved in NASA , <unk> to NASA <unk> , and I went to Russia , and I went to the <unk> biomedical <unk> and all those kinds of things , to go to the International Space Station with our 3D cameras .
And this was fascinating .
But what was the final result was that I was able to bring space to our <unk> with us in the deep ,
And they take it so that they could have access to <unk> , planetary scientists , and people who were interested in those extreme environments , they go down to the sources and take samples and take samples , etc . , etc .
So , here , we were making documentary films , but actually , in fact , it &apos;s doing science , and actually <unk> on it .
I had the circle around the <unk> of science fiction , you know , you know , as a child and all of this .
And you know , over this journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science . But I learned a lot about leadership .
Now , you might think that an artistic director should be a leader , unfortunately , is the captain of the ship and that sort of stuff .
I didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until I did those expeditions .
Because I had to say , &quot; What do I do here ? &quot;
Why do I do this ? What I win ? &quot;
We don &apos;t deserve money with these damn programs .
They &apos;re hardly <unk> . There &apos;s no <unk> .
People think that I &apos;ve gone away from &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; , and that I was going to turn thumbs on somewhere else .
I made all these movies , all of this <unk> , for a very limited audience .
No <unk> , no glory , no <unk> . What are you doing ?
And you &apos;re doing it for the work itself , for the challenge , and the ocean is the most challenging environment that it &apos;s , for the discovery of discovery of discovery , and for that strange coupling to form a small group of people .
because all of these things were working with <unk> people for years to work .
Sometimes for <unk> months at a time .
And by the opening , you realize that the most important thing you have is the respect that you have , and that said to you , you &apos;ve got to have a job done that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
When you go back to land and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the <unk> , and this , and all the technology and the difficulty , the human achievement of work on the sea , which can &apos;t explain to people . It &apos;s the thing that may have policemen , or people in the military who have gone through something like that , and they can tell you that it never could explain .
That creates a bond , creating a bond of respect .
So , when I came back to my next film , what &apos;s called Avatar , I tried to use that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and that you are in exchange ,
And that really changed the dynamic .
So , there was a little bit of a team in this , not yet mapping , &quot; Avatar , &quot; new technology <unk> that didn &apos;t exist before .
Pretty excited .
<unk> challenging .
And we became a family during four and a half years .
And it changed completely how to make movies .
So , people were commenting on how you were saying , well , the ocean came back back and forth on the planet .
But for me , it was a fundamental way of doing things , the process itself , which was the process of changing it .
So , what can we synthesize by this ?
You know , what are they learned ?
Well , I think number is curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing that you own .
<unk> is a power that can manifest reality .
And the respect of your team is more than all the <unk> in the world .
There are young filmmakers that come to me and say , &quot; Give me some advice to this . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Don &apos;t take your limitations .
Other people will do that for you , don &apos;t do it , don &apos;t bet , don &apos;t bet against yourself .
And take risks . &quot;
NASA has this adage where it &apos;s crazy : &quot; <unk> is not an option . &quot;
But failure has to be an option in art and discovery , because it &apos;s a leap of faith .
And not a single important endeavor that drives innovation without risk .
You have to be willing to take those risks .
And that &apos;s the thought that I &apos;d like to leave you with , which is in whatever you &apos;re doing , but fear . Thank you .
Now , if I like to leave you with one big idea , it &apos;s that it &apos;s all the data that we use , bigger than the sum of the parts .
Instead of thinking about the <unk> of information , I want to think about how we can use information to create patterns and trends that would otherwise remain invisible .
This is a typical <unk> <unk> <unk> at age .
The tool I use here is a quick experiment .
It &apos;s called <unk> . With <unk> , I can filter it at one cause of death , for example .
and I can see some other pattern coming out there .
That &apos;s because here in the middle of the people are the most active , and there &apos;s the <unk> .
We can go back to beyond what &apos;s going to happen to the data again .
We can see that heart disease and <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not everybody .
And when we go further and filter down and filter it for 40 years or younger , we can see that accidents are the largest cause .
Now , if you go deeper into it , it &apos;s true , especially for men .
You can see what I mean : look , look , look at information in a living environment ,
And if we can do this with raw data , why not also content ?
So what we have here is this is the cover of <unk> <unk> that &apos;s ever done .
All right ?
You can go to your room and try to this ,
With <unk> , you can zoom in a decade .
You can zoom in a particular year .
You can go to a certain number .
So , I &apos;m looking at this , and I see these athletes coming out in this number , the sports .
So , I &apos;m a fan of <unk> Armstrong , so forward , so , I click on , and that gives me all numbers where <unk> Armstrong occurs .
Now , if I just want to look just quick , I think , &quot; Why don &apos;t you look at all the <unk> ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to take a step back and pick it up .
Now I can see Greg <unk> .
Now , you can see that if you put this way through information , smaller and broader , you can &apos;t figure it out , you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t .
You know , what &apos;s different is a little bit different .
It &apos;s in between , and we think it changes how to use information .
So , I want to take it a little bit further , a little bit more <unk> ,
Here , we &apos;ve got every page of Wikipedia and it &apos;s limited to a little summary .
The summary of a little <unk> , and it &apos;s the <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> to put it on ,
Let me just show you the top 500 <unk> <unk> .
But even in this limited view , we can do a lot .
We can immediately get an idea of the topics that are <unk> on Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to go further , and choose government .
Now , I &apos;ve chosen to suggest that the <unk> , I see that the <unk> that &apos;s the most common , Time magazine .
This is a very important thing because this was the vision of the <unk> <unk> .
You can just get it through a step backwards and to look at it all .
Now , if I look at one of these summaries , I can look back into the understanding of the magazine Time magazine by the year , and it &apos;s all to show them to show it .
In fact , a look at all these people &apos;s people tell me that &apos;s the majority of the politics .
Some come from the natural sciences .
Another little bit of a business ,
That &apos;s my boss .
Here &apos;s one from the <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is , is that Bono &apos;s a TED <unk> .
So we can go to all the TED <unk> .
So , we can navigate first by the web by the Web , so it &apos;s just a web page , not from page to page to page pages , but it &apos;s not going to be much more <unk> .
Now , I &apos;d like to show you another thing that might be surprising to you .
Let me show you the website of the New York Times .
<unk> , this applies -- I don &apos;t want to call it a browser , it &apos;s actually not browser , but you can look at web pages -- we can map this <unk> technology to every page , so .
I &apos;m going to go back a step back and spring back , right into a specific section .
Now , the reason why this is important , is that I &apos;m just going to look just like this page on web pages , I can look at my whole <unk> look at the same way .
Now , I can look deeper into what I &apos;ve done in certain periods .
Here &apos;s the status quo .
Now , I can play some things that I &apos;m going to look before today .
Now , when I <unk> a step , and all of them look , I can <unk> my <unk> <unk> from my <unk> .
Here &apos;s some <unk> research , and I was looking for Bing Labs , and here are Live Labs .
From there , I can go back to the page , and it &apos;s going to go back to it again .
It &apos;s a metaphor that every time it gets over and over and over again , and every time it makes it larger than the sum of the parts of the data .
Today , in our world , we can see data as a curse .
We talk about the <unk> of <unk> information .
We &apos;ve got it over ?
Now , if we could put that back on its head , and the Web , so instead of going on , instead of going to the next thing , we can get it to many things to many things , and the patterns can be seen to many things .
Now , if we can do that , we can &apos;t be in data , maybe we can actually take information out there .
Instead , instead of working with information , we might be able to acquire knowledge .
Now , if we have knowledge , it might be even wisdom .
Thank you so much .
Everybody talks today ,
Now , I &apos;ve got someone reading the number of books that over the last five years came up with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title , and it was 10 times more .
There &apos;s a lot of interest in happiness among researchers .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
Everyone likes to make people happier .
But despite the mass of the work that there are different cognitive representations that it &apos;s almost impossible to think about happiness in happiness .
And I &apos;m going to talk today about the cognitive dissonance .
This is true of ordinary people who think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for researchers thinking about happiness , because it turns out that we are like all the other .
The first trap is the <unk> to be complexity .
It turns out that the word of happiness simply is not a useful word anymore because we apply it to too many things .
And I think there &apos;s one set of meaning that we could be able to limit it , but all of this is something that we &apos;ll need to leave , and we &apos;ll need to take the more complicated vision of what well-being is .
The second trap is the confusion between experience and memory : that &apos;s going to be the difference between happy life and happiness are over your life or happy life .
And those are two totally different things that are being thrown in a lot of different things in the world .
And the third trap is the illusion of focus and the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think of a circumstance that affects our well-being without influence .
I mean , this is a cognitive trap .
There &apos;s no way to get this good way .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who was during a <unk> and <unk> after one of my lectures .
And this was the story .
He was saying he had to listen to a symphony , and it was absolutely fantastic music and at the end of the recording , there was a terrible <unk> sound .
And then he said , in fact , a whole <unk> , which was the whole experience of <unk> .
But that &apos;s not true .
It was the memories of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had amazing music .
They had nothing more worth it , because he was stuck with a memory ; the memory was <unk> , and the memory was all he had to love .
What this is telling us is that we can see ourselves and others could be more than two people .
There &apos;s a <unk> I live in , who lives in the present moment , and the present is capable of experiencing the past , but it &apos;s essentially the present .
The doctor will look up till our <unk> I -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt when I &apos;m here ? &quot;
And then it &apos;s the <unk> I , and it &apos;s the person who is the <unk> and the story of our lives , and that &apos;s the person who is going to look , and that &apos;s the person who says , &quot; How did you feel the last time ? &quot;
or &quot; How to <unk> &quot; or something .
Those are two very different things , which I <unk> , and I <unk> and the confusion between both of the <unk> that are made of happiness .
The <unk> I <unk> ,
And that begins with a fundamental <unk> of our memories -- it starts off immediately .
We don &apos;t just tell stories when we tell us stories .
Our memory tells us stories , which is what we can preserve of our experiences .
And let me start with one example .
This is an old study .
Those are true patients that have a painful surgery .
I &apos;m saving you the details . This is not painful anymore , but it was painful when this research was in the &apos; 90s .
They had to report every 60 seconds of their pain .
And these are two patients .
These are their records .
And he &apos;s asked , &quot; How many of the pain ? &quot;
And that &apos;s a very easy question .
It &apos;s clear that the patient has had pain more pain .
And his <unk> took longer , and before every minute of pain that patient A has A has had a level , and more .
But here &apos;s another question : How many pains are these patients ?
And what &apos;s surprising is that the patient is a much worse reminder of the <unk> of the <unk> than patient .
The stories of the <unk> <unk> because a very important part of the story is -- and none of these stories are very inspiring or clever -- but one of them is all of it -- but one of them is much more than the other .
And the worse story is the story in which the pain peaked at the end .
That &apos;s a sad story .
How do we know ? Because we asked these people after their <unk> , and a lot later , and a lot later ,
and it was much worse for A than B , in their memory .
Well , this is a <unk> conflict between the <unk> and I <unk> .
So from the point of view , I &apos;ve had a point of thumb that I &apos;ve had a lot of <unk> .
Well , what you could do with the patient A , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical trials , and that &apos;s true , and it &apos;s going to work , and it &apos;s going to be able to put the <unk> of the patient A can just put it in , without too much <unk> .
That causes the patient &apos;s pain , but not much , and much less than before .
And if you take that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve got it before the patient made a difference , and I did it for the first time , and I did it for the patient to a much better because your patient A is a better story about his experience .
What determines a story ?
And that &apos;s true for the narratives that our memory , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we &apos;re making .
What a narrative defines changes , important moments and <unk> .
<unk> are very , very important , and in this case was the most important thing .
Well , I live life continuously .
It has moments of experience , one after the other .
And you ask , what happens to these moments ?
And it &apos;s really simple .
They are forever lost .
I mean , most of the moments of our lives -- I did the math -- you know , the psychological present now takes about three minutes .
That means , you know , you have about 600 million million million .
In a month , there are about 600,000 .
Most of them leave no track .
In the majority of them , I &apos;m not paying attention to the <unk> .
And yet , you get some sense of the way that they should be counted , that what &apos;s happening throughout this <unk> is our life .
It &apos;s the finite materials that we <unk> when we &apos;re on Earth .
And how you use it is to be relevant , but this is not the story that I think it &apos;s <unk> for us .
So , we have this <unk> , and I <unk> , and these are completely different .
The most difference between both of them is in terms of time .
From the point of view , I have a vacation , and it &apos;s the second week , and it &apos;s the second week that it &apos;s going to take two weeks twice as well as the end of a week .
That &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work .
In terms of the <unk> , I can hardly hardly be seen better than the vacation of one week because there are no new memories .
You &apos;ve not changed the story .
And in that way , time is actually the critical variable that I <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that I <unk> from a <unk> .
Time has very little impact on this story .
The <unk> I <unk> and tell stories .
It &apos;s the person who takes the decisions , because if you have a patient who says , well , you &apos;ve had two <unk> on two different surgeons and decide to decide what it chooses , then it chose the least bad memory , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s going to choose it .
The <unk> I have no voice in this choice .
We don &apos;t choose between experiences .
We choose between memories and experience , and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think differently about our future as experiences ,
We think of our future as false memories .
And you can look at this , as follows , as a dictatorship , and you can see it , as the person I sort of <unk> through the experience that I don &apos;t need , and I don &apos;t need the sense that if we often go to vacation , it &apos;s going to be the case that , in the end , it &apos;s going to take a long part of our <unk> , I &apos;m going to serve .
And that &apos;s kind of hard to justify .
I mean , how often do we use our memories ?
That &apos;s one of the explanations that is given to the dominance of that I was giving .
And when I think about this , I think about a vacation that we had a couple of years ago in Antarctica , which was clearly our best vacation ever was , and I think it &apos;s quite a lot in comparison .
And I &apos;ve probably used my memories of three weeks in about 25 minutes for about 25 minutes .
Now , if I had opened the map with 600 photographs in it , I would have spent another hours going on .
So these are three weeks , and that &apos;s nearly half hour .
There seems to be a mismatch .
Now , maybe I &apos;m a little extreme , you know , you know , in the limited hunger that I have to use memory , but even if you do that more often , the ham butt problem : why do we prioritize so much interest in terms of memories in terms of the memories that we attach ?
So I want you to think about a <unk> .
Suppose you know on the next holiday you know that at the end of the vacation were going to be destroyed and you &apos;ll get a pill to remember your memory , so you can &apos;t remember .
Would you choose the same vacation ? And if you chose a other vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two <unk> .
and you need to think about how to solve that conflict .
That &apos;s not so obvious , because if you think in terms of time , you have a certain answer .
And if you think in terms of the memories of memories , you might have a different answer .
Why is it that we chose to choose , is a question which is a question which is <unk> with a choice between the two <unk> .
Now , the two vessels lead to two <unk> of happiness .
There are two forms of happiness that we can use , one I can use .
So you can ask , how happy is it ?
And then you would ask , how happy are they the moments of life ?
And it all -- the happiness of moments of moments of moments is a rather complicated process .
What are the emotions that can be measured ?
By the way , we are able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the happiness of the <unk> I <unk> through time .
Now , when you ask about the happiness of the <unk> I is is that a totally different thing .
This is not about how happy someone lives .
It &apos;s about how satisfied or <unk> the person is when they think about her life .
Quite different concepts .
Anyone who &apos;s betting on one hope will make a <unk> of the happiness , and I <unk> a group of students from the well-being that I &apos;ve made a <unk> <unk> from the study of happiness in the study of the happiness of happiness .
The distinction between happiness from the <unk> I , and the satisfaction of the <unk> I &apos;ve recently discovered , and now there are attempts to measure the two separate <unk> in which over more than half a million people are asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences .
And there are more efforts in this sentence .
So in the recent years , we begin to learn to acquire insight in the happiness of the two superpowers .
And the most important lesson we &apos;ve learned , I think , is that it &apos;s really different from each other .
You can know how someone with life with his life , and that tells you really little about how happy it is , and vice versa .
Just to give you an idea of the correlation , which is about 0.5 .
That means that if you would meet someone and you would say that his father is a meter 80 , how much would you know ?
You &apos;d know something about his length , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
That &apos;s how much of the uncertainty would have , if I tell you that someone &apos;s life is going to be eight , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are ,
So it &apos;s weak .
We know something about what the satisfaction of the <unk> I define .
We know that money is very important ,
We know that happiness mainly means that we are satisfied with people who we should , through time , with people that we should .
There are other ways of <unk> , but this weighs
So , if you want to maximize the happiness of the two superpowers , it will make a sense of what you &apos;re doing .
The conclusion of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really might not consider happiness as a <unk> for well-being .
It &apos;s a completely different concept .
And then very quickly -- another reason why we can &apos;t <unk> happiness over happiness , is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and when we live ,
So , if you ask the simple question , how happy people in California are not going to be the right answer .
If you ask that question , you think that people have to be happier in California if you live in Ohio .
And what happens is if you think about life in California , you think , in contrast between California and other places , and that contrast , in the climate .
Well , it turns out that the climate is not so important for the <unk> I , and even not before , I &apos;m deciding how happy humans are .
But because it &apos;s thinking , I can tell you how to run it -- that some people in California are moving to California .
And it &apos;s interesting to go to what &apos;s going to happen to people moving to California in the hopes of getting happier happier .
Well , their <unk> self will not be happier .
That &apos;s what we know .
But one thing happens to happen . They think they are happier , because when they think about it , they &apos;ll remind them how awful it was in Ohio .
And they will think that they made the right decision .
It &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being over well-being , and I hope I &apos;ve given you a sense of how <unk> it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a demand for you .
Thank you very much .
When a few weeks ago , you told me that there was a very interesting finding from that <unk> that came out of that <unk> .
Can you <unk> this with us in a few minutes ?
Daniel <unk> : certainly , I think the most interesting result of the <unk> is a number that we had absolutely not expected .
It has to do with the happiness of my happiness .
When we look at how emotions are different from income inequality ,
It turns out that under the <unk> of 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans , and then it &apos;s about a big group of Americans , about 600,000 , a big standard , with income under 600,000 dollars a year --
CA : 60,000 ? : 60,000 dollars a year , 60,000 dollars a year , are people unhappy , and they become <unk> as much .
Up there , we see a perfectly flat line .
I mean , I &apos;ve seen a <unk> lines of lines .
And it &apos;s clear , what happens is that the money you don &apos;t take a <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t make any money because you can &apos;t measure the misery with large , very large , very large ,
For the other thing I , I , you know , I have a very different story ,
The more money you make , the more fulfilling you ever know .
That &apos;s not true for emotions .
CA : But Danny , the whole American pursuit of life is focused on life , freedom , and pursuit of happiness .
Now , when people take the results seriously , this might seem like all of us to think about what we believe , say , <unk> policies and so on .
Is there a chance that politicians , which would take the country in general , would take a result and apply public policy ?
DK : You know , I think it &apos;s acknowledged by the role of <unk> in public policy .
That recognition will be going to be slow in the United States , which is not doubt , but in the U.K . , this is happening , and in other countries .
People realize they should think about happiness when they think about public policy .
It will take a time , and people will argue about whether they want to be studying whether to study or to study the evaluation of life , so we will argue that &apos;s going to have to have this debate soon .
How we raise happiness is all different ways of how you think and whether you think about it , or whether you &apos;re thinking about the <unk> I <unk> .
This will affect policy in the next few years , I think .
In the United States , they are done to measure the <unk> of the population .
That &apos;s going to be in a year or 20 times of the national statistics .
CA : Well , it looks like this thing is the most interesting thing to follow , or should be in the next few years .
Thank you very much .
Thank you , Danny <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
And that may seem a little surprising , because my full-time job is about vaccines and seeds , about the things that we need to invent and deliver it to the poorest two billion people .
But energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than this planet .
The climate <unk> , so their crops will not grow .
There will be too much rain .
Things going to change so that their fragile environment can &apos;t do it anymore .
And that leads to hunger . It leads to <unk> . It leads to <unk> .
So it &apos;s going to be the climate change for them .
The price of energy is extremely important for them .
In fact , if you could choose one thing to be cheaper , to reduce the poverty , you would choose your energy .
The <unk> is <unk> down .
Really , advanced culture is based on the progress of energy .
The <unk> led to the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a very quick <unk> for electricity , and that &apos;s why we have <unk> , and so many things .
And so we have this beautiful situation with electricity in the rich world .
But , now , it &apos;s going to be cheaper -- and let &apos;s take it twice as cheap -- it &apos;s going to be a new limitation , and it &apos;s going to make it a new limitation , and it &apos;s going to use CO2 .
CO2 leads to the global warming , and the equation of CO2 is actually a very simple one .
As you combined , the CO2 that &apos;s emitted , it leads to the temperature , and it leads to some very negative effects .
The effects of the weather and , perhaps , the indirect effects , that natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to these rapid changes , and so you get to the ecosystems that collapse .
Now , the exact amount of how you can go from a sea level of CO2 to which is going to go , and where it &apos;s going to be the positive environmental problem , it &apos;s all the uncertainty , but not very much .
And there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how big the impacts are , but they will be very serious .
Now I &apos;ve asked this question to <unk> .
Is it going to be near zero ?
Can &apos;t we take half a quarter ?
And the answer is that , until we get near zero , it &apos;s going to keep going up .
So this is a big challenge .
It &apos;s very different from for example , for example , a <unk> truck under <unk> meters under <unk> meters , and it &apos;s able to squeeze it .
This is something that has to be on zero .
Now , we &apos;re eating a ton of CO2 , over over 26 billion tons .
In fact , it &apos;s about 20 tons .
In fact , in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
It &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
And we need to figure out how to change it to zero .
It has gone up forever .
But what &apos;s economic changes have the sort of <unk> , so we &apos;ve got to have a rapid increase in a reduction in a reduction , and from a reduction in zero ,
This equation has four factors .
a little bit of <unk> .
So , you &apos;ve got something on the left , CO2 , that you want to go to zero , and that &apos;s based on the number of people , the average use of service services per person , and the average use of energy , and CO2 emissions by CO2 emissions .
So , let &apos;s look at this one and see how we can get this to zero .
It &apos;s probably going to be one of these values anywhere from zero .
That &apos;s high school , but let &apos;s take a look at it .
First of all , we have the population .
Now , the world today has <unk> billion people today .
That &apos;s up to about nine billion .
So , if we really do with new vaccines , health , health , wireless health , we could reduce that , maybe 10 or 15 percent , but we can see that there &apos;s about 1.3 .
The second factor is the services we use .
This includes everything , the food that we eat , clothing , TV , <unk> .
These are very good things , and it &apos;s bringing poverty to these services to almost everybody on the planet .
So it &apos;s amazing when this number goes up .
In the richer world , maybe the top one billion , we probably can probably <unk> and <unk> , but this is how this number is going to happen , and it &apos;s going to be , in total , the <unk> services per person more than doubles .
Here we have a very simple service .
You &apos;ve got to take your <unk> in your house to read your homework , so those kids don &apos;t go , so they go outside their homework .
So , efficiency , E , this energy ,
Finally , we have good news .
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
Through diverse inventions and new ways of using enlightenment , through other forms of cars , different ways of building .
There are lots of services where you need it to be able to reduce the energy
Some individual services , even with 90 percent .
There are other services , like how we produce manure or how to deal with <unk> , where it &apos;s much smaller .
And so , if we are optimistic , we can have a factor of three to maybe even , maybe ,
But for these first three factors , we have gone from 26 billion dollars , in its best , 13 billion , and that &apos;s just not enough .
So let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be something that is going to be -- and that &apos;s the CO2 emissions by <unk> .
So the question is , can you get it to zero ?
If you <unk> coal , no .
If your natural gas is , no .
Basically , every way that today we produce electricity today , except the emerging renewable energy and nuclear power produces CO2 .
And what we need to do is have to create a new system .
So we need <unk> .
So , when I use this term , I &apos;m not saying something that &apos;s impossible .
The microprocessor is a miracle . The PC is a miracle .
The Internet and his services are a miracle .
So , people have been contributing to creating a lot of wonders .
Typically , we don &apos;t have a deadline , when you have to have the wonder at a certain date .
Usually , you just wait , and sometimes it happens , sometimes ,
This is a case in which we actually need to go on at full speed and a miracle <unk> within a tight agenda .
Now , I thought , how can I actually <unk> this ?
Is there a sort of natural illustration , a demonstration of that with people to the imagination ?
I was thinking back back back to a year ago when I was brought in with mosquitos , and somehow it liked it .
It made it really up with the idea that there are people who live with mosquitos .
So with energy , this was the only thing I could think .
So , I decided to get rid of fireflies like my contribution to the environment here in this year .
So here &apos;s what natural fireflies .
I &apos;m told you don &apos;t bite it , stronger , not even this pot .
So , there are all sorts of <unk> solutions like that , but they don &apos;t really deliver anything .
We need solutions , one or more , on an incredible scale , and of incredible reliability , and even though people in many ways , I can see there &apos;s only five which can provide a meaningful contribution .
Plus , I &apos;m <unk> , geothermal , nuclear energy , nuclear power .
That may be able to contribute to something like this , and if it &apos;s better , it &apos;s the better , but my main point here is that we need to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t stand there , because it looks so <unk> , because it looks like this , because it &apos;s all their own important difficulties .
Let &apos;s look at fossil fuels , or burning from the burning of coal ,
What you have to do , it might seem simple , but it &apos;s not .
You &apos;ve got to collect all the CO2 from burning fires , <unk> and <unk> , and hope that it stays there .
Now there are some <unk> that this at the level of 80 to 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to be 100 percent , and it &apos;s going to be very difficult and figure out where it &apos;s going to store CO2 , it &apos;s very difficult , but the most difficult of this is the <unk> .
Who &apos;s going to know this ?
Who &apos;s going to be <unk> for something that &apos;s literally a bit larger than any sort of waste that you can consider in terms of nuclear power or other things ?
This is a huge volume .
So it &apos;s going to be hard .
The next is nuclear energy .
There are three big problems in terms of this .
The costs , especially in strong <unk> countries , are high .
The issue of security , really sure that &apos;s not going to be wrong , that , even though you have these human operators , that can &apos;t be used for nuclear power .
And what do you do with the waste ?
And , although it &apos;s not so much , there are plenty of worry about it .
You &apos;ve got to have a good feeling about it .
So three very difficult problems that may be solvable , and what &apos;s going to be worked .
The last three of the five , I have <unk> .
These are what people often call renewable sources .
And that -- although it &apos;s amazing , they don &apos;t require any fuel -- right ?
One is that it won &apos;t take the density of energy because of these technologies significantly lower than this of a <unk> .
This is <unk> , you know , over many square kilometers , thousands and thousands of times more space than you need for a standard power station .
These are <unk> sources .
The sun doesn &apos;t shine every day , and not every day , and it doesn &apos;t always happen .
And so , if you depend on these resources , you have to find a way to have the <unk> <unk> that they &apos;re not available .
So , we have big <unk> here .
We have <unk> challenges .
Now , for example , this energy protein is outside of your country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , but you have to do with the risk of the energy from elsewhere .
And , finally , the <unk> problem .
And to make that visible visible to any of the batteries , for cars , for computers , for telephones , for <unk> , for all , and compared to the amount of electrical energy that used to take the world , and what I found is that all the batteries we make are less than 10 minutes of energy .
So , we need this big breakthrough , something that is a bit better than the approach we have now .
It &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
This is going to be important when you try to get rid of the <unk> source than 20 to 30 percent of what you use .
If you take it for 100 percent , you need a <unk> .
Now how are we going to find progress : what &apos;s the right approach ?
Is it a <unk> ? How can we achieve this ?
Well , we need lots of companies that work , hundreds of them .
In each of these five paths , at least a hundred people .
And a lot of them , you &apos;ll find it crazy . That &apos;s good .
And , in fact , I think here in the <unk> , we &apos;ve got lots of people who already have this already .
Bill <unk> has different companies , including a guy named <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> investing in dozens of companies that have amazing things and interesting opportunities , and I try to support it .
Nathan Myhrvold and I support a company that may be surprising ,
There are some innovations in nuclear , modules , and liquid .
And there &apos;s no innovation in this industry , so it &apos;s not so strange that there are good ideas .
The idea of <unk> is that instead of using just a small piece of uranium ; one percent , one percent , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s a little crazy idea .
They &apos;ve ever thought about this , but they could never simulate a good , or it would work .
But by the coming of supercomputers , it can be , and yes !
With the right materials , this will probably work .
And because you use the 99 percent , it reduces the cost .
You actually use the waste , and if you can take gas and use the waste of current reactors today .
So instead of <unk> , it &apos;s great .
It uses this uranium <unk> . It looks like a candle .
You can see in this animation , often called it <unk> reactor .
For the fuel , this is the solution .
I have a picture of a picture of a place in Kentucky .
This is <unk> , the 99 percent , where it &apos;s gone .
So it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
That &apos;s enough for the U.S. for hundreds of years .
And by filter on a cheap way of water , you get enough gas for the lifetime of the entire planet .
So , there are lots of challenges for the future , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to go forward .
So let &apos;s think how to measure ourselves ?
How should our report look like ?
Let &apos;s look at what we need to come up with , and then go to the <unk> .
By 2050 , many people over 80 percent reduction .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s really important .
And that 20 percent will be used by poor countries , a <unk> .
Hopefully , we have clean forestry and cement .
So , in fact , in order to take those 80 percent to the developing countries , including countries like China , they have to have countries like China ,
And the other requirement : <unk> technology in all developed countries in all developed countries ?
That &apos;s very important .
That &apos;s a big <unk> for that report .
So how should he see the report going ?
Well , it has to meet those two requirements .
We need to reduce the efficiency of improvements emissions .
The less we <unk> , the lower CO2 , and so , how lower the temperatures .
But in some ways , the degree that we gain from doing things that don &apos;t really bring us all to the large <unk> , just , even , or maybe even less important than the other , that &apos;s the innovation .
These breakthroughs are going to accelerate on high speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , <unk> , <unk> things that have changed .
Here &apos;s a large number of beautiful books .
The book of Al Gore : &quot; Our Choice &quot; and the book of David <unk> &apos;s book , &quot; <unk> energy without the hot air . &quot;
And it &apos;s very good , and it &apos;s a framework that can be discussed , because this can be discussed in large lines , because we &apos;ve got to get this <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
So this is a wish .
It &apos;s a very concrete wish we invent this technology .
But if you gave me one wish for the next 50 years , I could be able to choose who president was , I could choose a vaccine , something where I could love , if I could choose a nuclear energy cost , without CO2 , this is the wish I could choose .
This is the one with the biggest impact .
If we don &apos;t get this wish , the separation between the people who think of short-term gains over time , between the United States and China , between poor and rich countries , and especially the lives of those two billion will be much worse .
So what should we do ?
What do I ask you to develop ?
We need to go for more funding .
In places like Copenhagen , they don &apos;t just have to talk about the CO2 ,
And they &apos;ve got to talk to you about these <unk> , and you &apos;ll just be surprised by the ridiculous <unk> to these innovative approaches .
We need <unk> , <unk> , ceiling , and trade , something that makes it visible .
We need to take the message .
This dialogue has to be <unk> and <unk> , including the steps that take the government .
This is a big wish , but I think we can reach it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you . Now I understand more about <unk> , OK -- I mean , the first place , I mean , I mean , the first place , can you put a sense of scale of the investment ?
Bill Gates : In fact , in order for the software , the supercomputer , all major scientists , is what we &apos;ve done , which is just tens of millions , and even even testing our materials in a Russian reactor to be sure that our materials work well , then it will be in the hundreds of millions .
The tricky thing is to be able to build the experimental reactor , finding some billion , finding it from the <unk> , to try to build that first actually .
Once you first built the first , if it works like <unk> , it &apos;s just obviously , because the economy , the <unk> , are so different than nuclear ,
CA : And yes , to understand it , it &apos;s going to build deep down below the ground below the ground , almost like this sort of vertical column of nuclear fuel , from this sort of <unk> uranium , and then it starts down ?
BG : That &apos;s true . Today , you &apos;ve got to be <unk> , so you have a lot of people and a lot of the controls , so many of the controls that can go wrong , that thing that you need to open and take stuff in and out .
That &apos;s not good .
So , if you have a very cheap gas that you can put 60 years back -- think of it as a <unk> -- put it down and it doesn &apos;t have the last of those complexities .
And it &apos;s just , and it &apos;s going to take 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
CA : It &apos;s a <unk> , which is a <unk> problem ,
BG : Yes . Now , what &apos;s going on with the waste , you can stand it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this approach -- whether you can actually remove it , and put it in another one , and it put it in another one , and it &apos;s actually <unk> it there .
And we start with the waste that today , which is in the reactor , which is in the reactor ,
That &apos;s our fuel .
So , what &apos;s a problem with these reactors , actually , is what &apos;s going to happen in our own , and it reduces the volume of waste from the waste process .
CA : But in your global conversation about these capabilities , where is the most important thing to do ?
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t chosen yet , and there are some interesting <unk> over everything called a nuclear physicist , so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company in Russia , India have been there .
I &apos;ve met the <unk> of energy about this , to talk about how this fits in the <unk> .
So I &apos;m optimistic . You know , you know , the French and the Japanese some work .
This is a version of something that &apos;s already done .
It &apos;s a big step forward , but it &apos;s like a quick reactor , and a lot of countries have built it , so everybody who has done a quick reactor , is a potential candidate first .
CA : So , in your mind , <unk> and probability of something like this ?
BG : Well , we need these kinds of <unk> at large scales that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to think , and then 20 years to implement it .
That &apos;s a sort of time of the <unk> <unk> that we have to meet .
And , you know , you know , <unk> when all of this is good , what many people want , could be easily .
And there are now dozens of companies , we have hundreds of them , who , again , when their research is going to go well , if the funding for their <unk> is good , they can compete .
And it &apos;s the best of two strokes , because then you can use a mix of these things .
We have at least one need to succeed .
CA : In terms of possible changes at scale , this is the largest ones you know ?
BG : A breakthrough is the most important thing .
That would have been , even without the <unk> , but the <unk> makes it so much bigger .
In the nuclear war , there are other innovators
You know , we don &apos;t know the work of their work like this , but the <unk> people , that &apos;s another approach .
There &apos;s a type of <unk> which looks a little bit hard , but maybe they &apos;ll tell us about us .
So there are several , but it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s a <unk> has a million times a million times a <unk> , and so , if you can interact with the negative effects , which are essentially the radiation , it &apos;s the radiation , and it &apos;s the cost , in terms of effect , in terms of effect on the land and different things .
CA : So , if this doesn &apos;t work ?
Do we have to begin to try to keep track of the <unk> of the Earth ?
BG : In fact , if you have this situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve got obese , and at the point on the <unk> of a heart attack .
Where are you going to go ? You can have a <unk> or something .
There &apos;s a line of research that &apos;s called a <unk> , which is different techniques that were going to slow down , which is going to slow down 20 or 30 years to get our solution .
That &apos;s just some insurance .
You hope you don &apos;t need it .
Some people say you don &apos;t even need to go to such insurance , because it &apos;s going to be lazy , you know , you don &apos;t have to eat it because you have a <unk> to save you .
Now , I don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s rational , but there &apos;s a timeline , but there &apos;s a timeline , that &apos;s going to happen in the <unk> of the way that it &apos;s going to happen , or if the innovation is going to take a much slower slower than we expect .
CA : <unk> skeptics : if you could say , if you could tell them or two sentences to them , what would you convince them ?
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics are different camps .
There are very few arguments for scientific arguments .
To say , there &apos;s negative feedback that &apos;s going to have to deal with these clouds ?
There are very , very , very few things that can tell you , there &apos;s a chance of one one at a time .
The main problem that we have here is just like AIDS .
You know , what &apos;s wrong , and you &apos;re going to pay a lot of them .
And yeah , when you have all sorts of pressing problems , it &apos;s going to take back the pain to get to get the benefit -- and a <unk> pain .
In fact , it doesn &apos;t necessarily explain the <unk> scenario , and there are people in the rich scenario , and there are people in the rich world that are going to say , okay , that &apos;s all quite a deal .
It should be that this is supposed to be the uncertainty of us .
But my dream is that , if you can make it economically , and then <unk> the <unk> , and it &apos;s okay , it doesn &apos;t care that there &apos;s no CO2 coming out , and I &apos;ll just take it because it was cheaper , but I will accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than first .
CA : And that would be your response to <unk> <unk> , which actually , if you spend all this energy on solving the <unk> , is that it &apos;s going to cost all the other goals of poverty and malaria and so on .
It &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to spend money if there are better things that we can do with it .
BG : Well , the actual spending for that R &apos;s D -- saying that the United States should spend over 10 billion more than now -- not so dramatically .
It doesn &apos;t take away any other stuff .
It &apos;s just a big deal in large numbers , and this can be good people from the opinion , when you have something to finance ,
That &apos;s , I think , is usually a waste .
Unless you are very close to a solution , and you just can <unk> the learning curve , and it &apos;s very cheap .
I think that we need more things to have the potential to be much less expensive .
Now , when it starts to start , let &apos;s take the energy industry , let &apos;s make the rich , then the rich can afford it .
I mean , we all could be able to pay for five times of our energy , without changing our lifestyle .
The disaster is for those two billion .
And even <unk> has changed .
Now , his <unk> is now , why you &apos;ve spoken about R D.
It &apos;s still , because of the earlier statements associated with the <unk> camp , but it realized that it &apos;s a pretty lonely camp , and so it &apos;s got this R &amp; amp ; <unk> .
And so there &apos;s a red wire that I think is a red wire .
It &apos;s crazy how little R D is funded .
CA : Well , Bill , I suspect I &apos;m guessing I &apos;m the name of most people here , when I say , I really hope that your wish is going to work . Thank you so much .
BG : Thank you .
I &apos;m going to share with you a few months ago when I discovered a piece of months ago when I wrote an article for Wired magazine .
I love the <unk> , when I write on writing , but I was ready to work with the piece , and I figured I &apos;d never <unk> the word &quot; <unk> &quot; before .
I read you the text .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> : &quot; <unk> , helpless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> : healthy , strong , strong , <unk> .
And I was reading this for a friend , and I was supposed to laugh , because it was so ridiculous , but it started to break my voice , and I had to stop back to myself because of the emotional shock and the <unk> that were causing these words .
Well , this is , of course , this , of course , of course .
And I still think this is an old busy .
But it was a pressure shift from early &apos; 80s , when I started talking about the lower school and a picture of my family and a picture of my family , and related to the other kids and around the world around me .
And I don &apos;t need to say , I didn &apos;t use <unk> <unk> .
With this description , it seems like I was born in a world where someone who I was considered are not positive about saying , if you were to say , if I was born , I &apos;ve spent the capacity and adventure in my life .
So , I was looking forward to 2009 , for 2009 , and I was expecting a really good <unk> .
This is the <unk> version of the text .
Unfortunately , not much better .
I &apos;m mostly the last words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> : &quot; completely . &quot;
It &apos;s not just about words .
It &apos;s our opinions about humans when we name them with these words .
The values behind the words , and how to construct it ,
Our language affects our thinking , and how to look at the world and how to look at other people .
A lot of old societies including the Greeks and the <unk> believed that it was a <unk> that was so powerful , because if you say something out loud ,
So what &apos;s reality , what is it ?
And so , if we <unk> something so simple when it comes to a person , a child , a child , is a child , then we put them on a shadow .
Do we prefer to open doors for them ?
Now , someone who was opening doors for me was my doctor when I was a child ,
He &apos;s called Dr. <unk> .
<unk> , whose name was too hard to speak , so he was Dr. P.
Dr. P. always wore <unk> <unk> and had exactly the right institution to work with kids .
I enjoyed almost everything in time when I was in that <unk> , except for the <unk> .
Now , I had to take a fast <unk> number , and I had to do with that thick <unk> -- different colors -- different colors -- to build my <unk> .
I was the <unk> more than anything .
I was writing them , gave them names .
As a <unk> child , I negotiated with Dr. P.
On a day , he came to a session -- <unk> and <unk> were the sessions -- and he said to me , &quot; Wow . Aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful girl , I think you &apos;re going to take a <unk> .
If you leave , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
Now , of course , this is a foundation of Dr. F.
Today , I &apos;m asking myself to look at what vision , and his observation was that I was a strong and powerful girl , and my sense of self is a powerful powerful , powerful , powerful person to far in the future .
This is an example of how adults in <unk> can be the power of a child .
But in the past , that <unk> from the <unk> of our own evolution , that &apos;s our evolution that we all would like to see : the ability for the individual to see itself as <unk> .
Our language follows the changes in society , not many of them , with technology .
From the name , from medical point of view , my legs , <unk> , titanium <unk> and <unk> <unk> with their ability to go beyond their capabilities to be able to go to the natural constraints , to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> themselves , and to say , well , that &apos;s how to interact with global groups that they choose to interact with global groups which they choose .
So , maybe technology shows us a lot of the <unk> things that always have been a truth : that all of us have something to offer and offer something to provide our best quality , and that &apos;s our ability to adapt our best quality .
The ability of people to fit it , is interesting , because everybody wants to talk to me all over the way of adversity , and I &apos;m going to tell you something .
The phrase has never been good , and it felt uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and I started to understand why .
The <unk> : &quot; The <unk> of adversity , &quot; meaning that happiness or happiness means that you &apos;re back again after a <unk> experience , <unk> , without having a <unk> <unk> , as if my successes are going to <unk> a life <unk> of a life with <unk> <unk> , what other people consider , as my handicap .
But in fact , we &apos;ve changed . Of course , we &apos;ve been drawn from a challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotional , or both .
And my argument is that it &apos;s a good thing .
<unk> is no obstacle to what we need to be around , but to live with life .
It &apos;s a part of our lives .
I tend to see it as my shadow .
Sometimes I see a lot of of them , sometimes very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
I &apos;m not going to be the impact and the importance of someone &apos;s struggle .
There is adversity and a challenge in life , and it all is true , and it &apos;s not all different , but it &apos;s not the question of you will have to deal with adversity , but how to deal with it .
So our responsibility is not simply to protect our loved ones for adversity , but it &apos;s not good enough to go .
We don &apos;t prove to our kids , if we let them feel like they &apos;re unable to fit ,
There &apos;s an important difference between the objective of the unbiased fact that I &apos;m a <unk> and the subjective of the subjective society of whether not <unk> .
And frankly , the only true disability that I &apos;ve ever encountered across the world was always the world that you could describe with those definitions .
In our yearning , to protect our loved ones from their medical forecast , or even a projection from the <unk> of life , we have to be sure that we don &apos;t put the first stone <unk> that we actually make a <unk> .
Perhaps the current way of looking at what &apos;s going on , and how to fix it and how to fix it , someone more <unk> than the pathology itself ,
It &apos;s not going to be able to go from the <unk> of a person whose strength is not to recognize , create a new disease on the natural struggle that they might have ,
In fact , we actually evaluate somebody else &apos;s value for our society .
So we &apos;ve got to look at the cause of the pathology to the range of human capability .
The most important thing is that there &apos;s a collaboration between those visible flaws and our best creative capacities .
It &apos;s not going to be able to deny those difficult times or to deny that something we want to avoid or <unk> , but instead of going to the <unk> , but instead of discovering the possibilities of <unk> .
Maybe it &apos;s the idea that I want to take you to the <unk> so that you don &apos;t have to overcome so much , but it &apos;s embracing it , embracing it , to use , to use , to use , to use a <unk> , maybe it can dance ,
And when we look at adversity , that &apos;s consistent and useful , then we may feel about less by <unk> .
This year , we celebrate the 16th century anniversary of Charles Darwin , and when he wrote about evolution over the evolution of Darwin , I think about the human character .
Quite translated , it &apos;s not the most powerful species that survives , nor is the most intelligent , but the species that are changing the way of change .
<unk> is the creation of creation .
In other words , among other things , we can argue that the human ability to survive and thrive are driven by the mental struggle through conflicts .
Again , transformation , adaptation , that &apos;s our greatest capacity .
Until we are in the trial , we don &apos;t know what we can .
Perhaps that &apos;s the thing that <unk> us : self-awareness , self-awareness , a sense of our own power .
So we can give ourselves a <unk> .
We can imagine space again and more difficult times .
Perhaps we can see it as a change .
<unk> is a change where we haven &apos;t adapted yet .
And I think that &apos;s the most important <unk> of adversity that we have given ourselves to the notion of <unk> .
Who &apos;s normal ?
There &apos;s no normal .
There &apos;s <unk> . There &apos;s no normal .
And who would love to meet the poor , <unk> person when it was ?
I didn &apos;t think .
And so , if we can convert the paradigm to <unk> <unk> to one of possibilities , or potentially , <unk> more dangerous , then we can <unk> the power of many more kids , and it invite their rare and valuable capabilities with the community .
<unk> tell us that it &apos;s the only thing that we need people always to be useful are useful , capable of contributing .
There are some evidence that Neanderthals were 60,000 years ago their elders and severe chest pain , maybe because of these people and survival of these people from value to the community , they were not considered broken and useless ; they were considered rare and valuable .
A few years ago , I was on the market in the village where I grew up in that red bar in Pennsylvania , and I was a <unk> tomatoes .
It was summer . I had a short pair .
I heard a man behind me : &quot; If that &apos;s not Aimee <unk> . &quot;
I turned around , it was an older man . No idea who was he was .
I said , &quot; Excuse me , we know ? I can &apos;t remember that . &quot;
He said , &quot; It &apos;s good that you don &apos;t know that we know each other .
When we met each other , I pulled out your mother &apos;s uterus . &quot;
Oh , that guy .
And of course , a lot when it grew up .
This guy was a doctor , a man who I just knew about my mother &apos;s stories , because I knew , of course , two weeks before my own birthday , I was going to be two weeks before my own birthday .
My mother &apos;s loved arts was already on vacation , so the man who was <unk> with my parents .
And because I was born without <unk> and <unk> feet , and a pair of toes on one , and on the other foot , this stranger had to communicate the bad news .
He said to me , &quot; You know , I had to tell you your parents that you could never walk , and never the <unk> would have different children and completely independent life , and from that moment , you have no independent life . &quot;
The amazing thing that he told me is that he collected <unk> over my childhood , whether it was that I won <unk> in the second grade , <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> wins , and it used it , <unk> it in his classes , and he used it , in his class , <unk> school and <unk> school .
Of course he called this <unk> , and it &apos;s the potential of human beings .
No projection can predict how powerful this can be , if the quality of life ,
Doctor <unk> continued to go beyond , and he said , &quot; Well , if it &apos;s not all the time , and even with just limited support , a child will go to a child . &quot;
You see , I had some <unk> <unk> ,
He understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone could do with it .
And over time , my thinking changed , because , when you asked me , if you asked me , if you asked me , if I had asked my <unk> , if I had a <unk> legs , I had no time to go .
In fact , I used to <unk> a <unk> .
Now , when you ask me , I don &apos;t know exactly the same .
That &apos;s because of the experiences that I had with it , not despite the experience with it .
Maybe this is in me , because I was more exposed to people who opened doors to me than to <unk> and <unk> .
Look , you just need one person to show you the revelation of your own power , and that &apos;s going to go there .
If you can give someone the key power to its own power , the human mind is so <unk> , if you can open it and open a door open source for someone , then you put them in the best way .
You learn to open doors to them .
The exact meaning of the word &quot; education . &quot;
That means that what inside is , that &apos;s inside , it &apos;s a potential .
So , again , what is the potential of that ,
There was a <unk> in the &apos; 60s in England in England where they went from <unk> to <unk> .
It was called <unk> . In the United States , we call it &quot; follow . &quot;
They split students in 10 , nine , eight , seven , seven , and so on .
The <unk> get a <unk> <unk> , the best teachers , etc .
Over a period of three months , they gave <unk> students a 10 , and they told them that they were there was an A.
At the end of three months , they <unk> them on <unk> .
And the <unk> side of this survey is that they told the <unk> they were <unk> .
And that happened after three months .
Those who were still on school , besides the people who had <unk> .
A key part of this research was that the teachers also kept on love .
The teachers didn &apos;t really know that there was something wrong .
There was this : these are the students with A.
And so they were teaching , and so they were treating them .
I think that the only true physical spirit of mind is that there &apos;s no hope of the spirit of mind .
He doesn &apos;t see beauty .
He doesn &apos;t have our natural , <unk> curiosity , and it &apos;s not our innate ability to imagination .
And if we can strengthen the mind , if we can hope , you can hope to see beauty in itself and other people , to be curious and <unk> , then we actually use our strength .
As a spirit , we have this ability , then we can create new <unk> , new ways to be ,
Now , I want to close with a poem by a <unk> Persian poet , <unk> , which tells me that my friend Jacques <unk> <unk> me .
The poem is called &quot; The god who knows only four words . &quot;
&quot; Every child knows God , not the God of <unk> , not the God of <unk> , but the God who knows about four words he <unk> and he <unk> : please dance with me .
Thank you .
