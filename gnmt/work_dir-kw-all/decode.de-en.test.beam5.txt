A few years ago , here at TED , Peter <unk> wrote a <unk> called &quot; The <unk> . &quot;
The idea is pretty easy . The idea is that there must be a <unk> folded structure with 20 spaghetti , just about <unk> tape and a marshmallow .
The marshmallow needs to be up there .
And even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard because it &apos;s really hard to cooperate .
And so I thought this is an interesting idea , and I converted it into a <unk> .
It was a huge success .
Since then I conducted about 70 workshops in the world , with students , <unk> and architects , even with <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s something on this quest to collaborate with the nature of collaboration , and I want to share some of them with you .
Normally most people begin to orient itself towards the task .
They &apos;ll talk about how it &apos;s going to look like this , they <unk> .
then you invest a little bit of time and organization , and so on .
They spend a lot of time in the mainstream of their time constant structures in the world .
After all , a minute before they have no time , someone take the marshmallow and they put it gently back to the top , and they go back to the top , and they admire them .
But what &apos;s happening , almost always , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be a <unk> , because the weight of the <unk> , that &apos;s the whole thing and <unk> .
There are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; more than others , and under the <unk> are fresh water .
They lie , they cheat , they are confused , they are <unk> .
And , of course , there &apos;s also teams which have a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; , and under the best , are fresh graduates .
And this is pretty amazing .
As we did , they don &apos;t just produce the top towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
What might they be like ? Why ?
And Peter said , &quot; None of the children are spending time on the spaghetti Passage . &quot;
They don &apos;t spend time in <unk> .
But there &apos;s another reason .
And that &apos;s that <unk> train was trained to find a right plan .
And that &apos;s him .
What happens when they put the marshmallow at the top , they have no time and what happens ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
Sounds familiar , what ?
What &apos;s different is that they &apos;re beginning to build with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , with the marshmallow at the top , so that they have been able to repair <unk> prototypes .
<unk> can recognize this type of work as a core <unk> <unk> .
And with every attempt to get the kids immediately instant feedback , and what &apos;s not .
So it &apos;s the achievement to work with prototypes , but we can see how different teams work .
The average number for most of you are about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , is a lot more , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
Who &apos;s the most successful ?
Architects and engineers , fortunately .
<unk> is the <unk> thing I &apos;ve seen .
And why ? Because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns the key to building stable structures .
CEOs are something about average , but this is interesting .
<unk> man a <unk> <unk> on the team , they &apos;ll significantly better .
It &apos;s incredible . You look around and see &quot; The Team will win . &quot;
You can predict that . Why ?
Because they have special skills of <unk> .
They conduct the process ; they understand it .
And this team , which drives , and on the work , can significantly improve the performance of teams .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination leads to success .
If you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six to have a firm structure .
Now I was trying to take something interesting .
I thought , let &apos;s take the <unk> equally .
So I offered a $ 100 prize award for the winner .
What do you think with these <unk> ?
What was the result ?
That &apos;s what happened . Not a team had a stable structure .
If you had a <unk> tall construction , he would have had the price of home .
So isn &apos;t it interesting that there &apos;s a massive <unk> effect ?
We repeated this practice with the same students .
What do you think ?
Now understand the benefit of the <unk> .
That was from the same , bad team of the best .
They produced the highest construction in the lower time .
So there are <unk> lessons for us to think about the natural Antrieb and success .
You might like , why would anyone actually invest a <unk> ?
The reason is , I &apos;ll create digital tools and processes to create teams , cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; .
And what the <unk> does , is it helps to identify them set of assumptions .
Because frankly , every project has his own marshmallow .
The challenge has a common experience , a common language , a common language , or <unk> prototype .
And this is the value of this experience , this is such a simple practice .
And those of you who are interested in can go to <unk> .
It &apos;s a blog where you can build the <unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> there .
They find crazy examples of all over the world , like people , and <unk> .
There &apos;s also <unk> .
And the primary lesson , I think , is that it &apos;s actually a <unk> sport .
It demands that we all set our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking , how our own emotions , and our actions , in the challenge , is in the challenge of being .
And sometimes it &apos;s a little prototype of this experience that it needs to take us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
And that can make a big difference .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s pretend to have a machine .
A big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a time machine .
And everybody in this room needs to .
And you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t go into this and now .
And I wonder what you would choose , because I asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go all over the past , and they wanted to go all to the past .
I don &apos;t know . You wanted to go back to the time before there were cars , or Twitter or &quot; America . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced , you know , that you can actually <unk> <unk> ,
And I understand .
I &apos;m not part of this group , I must say .
I don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because I &apos;m a <unk> .
It &apos;s because it &apos;s not going to go back to this planet , they go ahead .
So I want to go into this machine , and I want to go to the future .
This is the best time that you had on this planet , no matter how long you use : health , wealth , wealth , and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
There was no time a time earlier .
My <unk> died from the age of 60 .
My grandparents urged this number to <unk> .
My parents are 80 to 80 .
So , there should be a nine in the beginning of my <unk> .
But it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a larger thing than that .
A child who &apos;s born today in New Delhi , as long as the richest man in the world , 100 years ago .
Think about it . That &apos;s an incredible fact .
And why is this ?
The smallpox epidemic . The smallpox epidemic killed billions of people on this planet .
They have the demographic demographic to a new way of how it &apos;s not war .
They &apos;re gone . They &apos;ve gone away .
We have them <unk> . <unk> .
In the rich world , there are diseases which are threatened by one generation of us before , hardly yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
Anyone even know what this is ?
, modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , is the successes of scientific method .
And from my view , the scientific method is to try to take things like this , if it doesn &apos;t work , it can change the world of humanity .
So this is the good news .
Unfortunately , this is all good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned to be mentioned .
And one of them is that , despite all of our achievements , a billion people in this world are going to go hungry every day .
That number goes up , and it goes very quickly , and this is a shame .
And it &apos;s not just that , we used to use our imagination to bring this world into a thorough world .
drinking water , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , gas : and that &apos;s going to disappear , and if we don &apos;t take away from this chaos , we also don &apos;t naturally go away .
So , the question is , can we do that ?
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that billions of people will feed without the country to rape .
I think we can power this world with energy that it &apos;s not destroyed at the same time .
I think that , and no , this is not a <unk> .
But this keeps me waking up at night -- one of the things that I wake up at night . We &apos;ve never seen so much as much as now , not so much .
And we &apos;ve never been able to put it in the same way that it &apos;s perfectly capable of how we can today .
We are on the verge of amazing events in many areas , and yet I think that we &apos;ve got hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment , in order for us to fight progress in progress , in which we &apos;ve spoken about these things in progress , are more <unk> than now .
The people in their faith are in their faith , so that you can &apos;t liberate it .
Not even the truth will .
And listen , everybody has a right up to your opinion , even a right up to your mind .
But you know , don &apos;t you ?
They have no right to their own facts . &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t have you .
And I took a while to find that out .
About a decade ago , I wrote a paper about <unk> for &quot; The New Yorker &quot; , a little article .
And I was amazed at the resistance of resistance to resistance , which is the most effective way of the effective activity in the history of mankind .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I did , so I was just doing a paper and I continued to go .
And soon , I wrote a paper over <unk> changed .
That &apos;s the same thing .
People were playing crazy .
So , I wrote a paper clip , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought , &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules , in a certain way , a <unk> sort of <unk> <unk> a <unk> in the field of nature .
But you know , I &apos;m doing what I &apos;m doing . I was writing .
I &apos;m a journalist .
We type , we go to eat , we go to eat , right ?
But I was worried , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally I found it .
And that &apos;s because this <unk> that was crazy to me at all , didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
These were <unk> people , <unk> people , decent people .
They were just like people in this room .
And that made me feel stuff like this .
But then I thought , well , what is it ?
We are at a point where we have not the same relationship with progress like that .
We talk about it .
We are talking about ironic <unk> about that : &quot; progress . &quot;
Okay , so there are reasons why there are reasons , and I think we know what is .
We have faith in institutions , in authority , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why this should not be so .
You can just call a few names , and people will understand .
Chernobyl , <unk> , the Challenger , the Challenger , <unk> , the <unk> , in 2000 .
I mean , you can choose your own list .
There are questions and problems with the people that we believed that they would always have .
Ask questions , ask evidence , ask evidence .
Don &apos;t take anything like that .
But now , if you get the evidence , you have to take this evidence , and it &apos;s not good .
And I can tell you why we live in an epidemic of fear of fear , as I never saw again , and hopefully I &apos;ll never see again .
About 12 years ago , a story published a story , a horrific story that was the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
Very <unk> .
<unk> studies were done to see if this was true .
<unk> studies should be done ; this is a serious business .
The data came in .
The data came from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference . It doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we think what &apos;s going to look like what we see in terms of seeing what makes us think .
We don &apos;t believe in a set of documents that we have , and I understand this , and I think that &apos;s what we all know .
But you know what ?
The result was <unk> .
<unk> because of this fact , the United States is one of the countries in the world where it &apos;s going to <unk> <unk> down .
That &apos;s <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
It &apos;s terrible .
What &apos;s happening is that we could do that .
Well , I understand this . That &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
Because here &apos;s a <unk> ?
Anybody in the audience to see someone dying ?
<unk> not very often .
In this country , in this country , in this country , in the last year , in the last year .
These are many deaths from <unk> , 20 per hour .
But because this isn &apos;t going to happen , we can put it in denial , and people like Jenny <unk> and messages from fear of fear and <unk> of platforms such as Oprah and Larry King .
And they can do it because it &apos;s not connecting and correlation .
You don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be , but almost never the <unk> .
And this is something that we need to learn , which is very quick .
This guy was a hero , Jonas <unk> .
He came from one of the worst nightmares of humanity .
No fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
That guy in the middle of not so much .
He &apos;s called Paul <unk> .
He &apos;s just developed a pair of other people in the world .
He can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
Pretty good , right ?
Now , this is good , except that Paul <unk> and over vaccines are talking about how valuable they are , and that people should just stop to <unk> .
And that &apos;s what he &apos;s saying .
So Paul is a terrorist .
When Paul speaking , he can &apos;t say he can say without any armed guards .
He gets his phone calls , because people like to tell him how to go to school .
And why ? Because Paul has made a vaccine .
I don &apos;t need to say , but vaccines are <unk> .
You take them away , they go back to the disease , terrible disease , and this is going to happen .
We have now <unk> in this country .
And this gets worse , and soon babies are going to die soon , because this is just a question of numbers .
And they won &apos;t just go to <unk> .
What about <unk> ?
A few weeks ago , I wrote a few weeks ago , and I think she &apos;s a little <unk> .
No one ever said before .
She wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child <unk> . No .
<unk> .
Why ? Because what is it ?
We had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
But today , I don &apos;t know , maybe this morning morning , someone in Lagos , and I &apos;m going to go to Los Angeles , right now , in a moment in Ohio .
And in a few hours , he goes to a car , and he &apos;s going to go to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to go to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to go to this <unk> <unk> .
And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how it works .
That &apos;s the planet that we live . Don &apos;t pretend that it &apos;s not .
We love it to <unk> . We love it .
Have you ever taken all your <unk> ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you to take action .
I know you &apos;ve done that because it &apos;s the Americans every day every day .
They take this stuff , and they take alternate cures , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we can figure out that they are useless .
The data back all over again .
You take your urine . That &apos;s more almost never .
That &apos;s okay , you want to pay for 28 billion dollars for dark pair .
I agree with you .
<unk> urine .
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?
Now , I think I understand -- we hate the <unk> .
We hate a too powerful government . We have no trust in the system .
And that &apos;s not what we should not . Our health system is <unk> .
It &apos;s awful to millions of people .
It &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> itself that it can afford .
So we go away from this , and where do we go ?
We run into the arms of <unk> .
That &apos;s great . I love the <unk> .
But you know , this is a serious issue , because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
And I have all sorts of <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , I don &apos;t even know what this is , but we spend billions of dollars on it , it &apos;s cheating .
And you know what ? If I say , I shout to people , and they say , &quot; What does it take ? Let &apos;s do whatever they want .
That &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
And you know what ? You have ?
Because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my experts , or any <unk> to try to treat his patient with <unk> . &quot;
When you go to this way , where faith and magic will replace and science evidence , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
They get to <unk> <unk> in South Africa .
He had 400,000 his people , because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , from whom it can be the progression of AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of thousands of thousands of deaths in a country that are getting worse than any of this disease .
Don &apos;t tell me that those things have no consequences .
They &apos;ve always got them .
Now , the <unk> epidemic in which we &apos;re right now , is this absurd battle between the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> food .
That &apos;s a <unk> debate .
It &apos;s a debate , over metaphors , over metaphors .
That &apos;s ideology , not science .
Everything that we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every branch , has changed by the people .
You know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
There was no <unk> . There was no <unk> . We did all that .
We &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
And some of that work , and some of it doesn &apos;t work .
We are <unk> , which doesn &apos;t work .
Now , we can do this , and of course , there are risks , but we can do something like this , and it can help millions of people in rice , and it can help millions of people , and millions of people , to try to raise life .
That &apos;s not what you want to do ?
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand .
We refuse <unk> food .
Why do we do that ?
Now what I &apos;m listening to all this : Too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , which is wrong .
We don &apos;t want to take companies to patent life .
We don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
And you know what my answer is ?
Yes , you have a right , and so on .
It &apos;s true , we have a big <unk> , but this is not science .
This is not doing with science .
It &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
You know , you know , the science is not a firm .
She &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but it &apos;s sometimes not , but the idea that we should not allow the science to be able to take their jobs , and it holds millions of people out of it and it holds millions of people out of life .
You know , in the next 50 years , we will have to grow 70 percent more food than right now .
This investment in Africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
You need it , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
And why ? <unk> changed .
We don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
<unk> is something that has a half billion people .
It &apos;s about a potato .
It &apos;s just a <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are all building it .
And then people might be able to eat it and not be blind .
You wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
That &apos;s beautiful . It wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
And all I can tell you is : Why are we fighting this ?
I mean , what is it ? Why are we fighting this ?
Because we don &apos;t want to go to genes ?
It &apos;s not about genes <unk> . It &apos;s not about chemicals .
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> <unk> , better food , <unk> food .
It &apos;s not about Rice <unk> , and it &apos;s about to keep people alive , and it &apos;s going to be really time to understand what this means .
Because you know what ?
Now , if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so , what we do , we don &apos;t want to be guilty of something that we don &apos;t want to be guilty of , <unk> colonialism .
There &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
It &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worth it , and it &apos;s not it .
So after this incredible conversation , you might want to say , &quot; You want to go to this ridiculous time and go to the future ? &quot;
Anyway , this is definitely .
In the moment , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
We can put this time all over what we want .
We can go to them , where we want to go to them , and we will go to it wherever we want to go .
We need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go into time in time , we &apos;ll be going to be glad that we &apos;re going to be glad .
I know that we can , and as far as I can , this is something that the world needs now .
Thank you . Thank you .
When Steve <unk> , <unk> of the Los Angeles Times was walking through the streets of Los Angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
She came from a man , a guy named <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who played on a violin , which was just two strings .
Many of you will know the history , because from <unk> articles later , later a book later , with Robert <unk> junior , when Steve <unk> was Steve <unk> like Steve <unk> and Jamie <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and whose <unk> was <unk> early in the <unk> <unk> schizophrenia .
<unk> left was a <unk> and a <unk> and 30 years later , he was living as <unk> on the streets of <unk> Row in downtown Los Angeles .
Now , I recommend telling you to read a book book or to look at the movie , so that you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful connection between these two men , but also how it was the way that it &apos;s building that instrument , and how it was that instrument was able to get <unk> , <unk> away from the street , <unk> away from the street , <unk> away from the road .
I met Mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , two years ago , in Walt Disney Hall .
He had just heard a show of <unk> First and <unk> <unk> , and came behind the stage and came back to the stage .
He spoke to a very <unk> and <unk> tone about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton , and over the way that it never <unk> it into the baseball World , and that all of the <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> in the last sentence of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we came to talk to speak to music , and a few days later , I received an email , which was to be interested in building music for me .
I &apos;ve got to mention that that &apos;s a medical treatment for <unk> treatment , because he had been treated with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> with <unk> and <unk> , a trauma to his life .
As a result of this now , it &apos;s especially vulnerable to these transcendent stages , which are sometimes so bad that it &apos;s going to threaten it , and it &apos;s going to go away for days of a sudden , in the streets of <unk> Row , and all of this and the horror of his own mind .
And in fact , in the same way , when we had a <unk> , when we first had our first <unk> in the Walt Disney World in Walt Disney Hall , he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes , and it was completely lost .
He was talking about invisible demons and smoke and over how someone wanted to poison her in her sleep .
I was scared , not <unk> , but I was scared that I could lose him in one of his states , and I could destroy his relationship to the violin , when I first started talking about the violin and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> <unk> .
So , I just started playing .
I played the first sentence of <unk> <unk> .
And as I played , I noticed that in <unk> eyes , I noticed that in <unk> eyes .
It was , as he was , under the effect of an invisible <unk> , a chemical reaction whose <unk> was my game .
<unk> <unk> anger was transformed into understanding and <unk> curiosity .
And as a miracle , he took his violin , and he started to hear some clips from <unk> <unk> , and asked me to play it , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So we started talking to music , starting from Beethoven , from Beethoven , <unk> , <unk> , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> <unk> .
And I realized that he didn &apos;t just have a <unk> knowledge on music , but it was also related to her own personal relationship .
He spoke of her passion and understanding the understanding of my colleagues in the <unk> of Los Angeles .
As he played music , he was talking about music , he was out of this <unk> , he moved out of the streets of Los Angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , fine , <unk> musicians .
Music is medicine . Music is changing .
To <unk> music means <unk> health .
Because the music allows it to be able to understand his thoughts and <unk> with his imagination and creativity in a way of <unk> .
And so he <unk> his <unk> .
I understood that that &apos;s the nature of art .
And that &apos;s why this is why we make music , so that &apos;s why in all of us , in all of us , in all of us , in all , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , to create reality .
And the reality of expression of expression , all of us , is inspired , inspired by us .
In terms of <unk> , it took him back to a community of friends .
The powerful force of music took him back to a family of musicians who understood him who had his talent and his talent .
And I &apos;m going back and forth with <unk> <unk> , whether in Walt Disney Hall or in <unk> Row , because he remembers why I become a musician .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Thank you . Thank you .
Robert <unk> .
Robert <unk> : I want to play a little bit , I want to <unk> the <unk> .
I hope you forgive me .
I &apos;m Jane <unk> . I &apos;m designing video games .
Now , I &apos;ve been developing a <unk> for 10 years , and my aim for the next decade is to try to save the world in reality to save the world in reality .
So , I have a plan . I want to convince you to get more people , including giving you all to spend more time with play and <unk> games .
Currently , we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
Some of you might think , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
Perhaps too much time when you think about how many problems we desperately need in the real world .
But in fact , my research at the Institute of the future for the future , is exactly the opposite :
Three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to solve the world &apos;s problems of the world .
In fact , I am convinced that if we want to live on this planet on this planet , we &apos;ve got to be able to increase this time dramatically .
I &apos;ve calculated that it took place at 21 billion hours per week .
Now that may seem to be a little bit more <unk> , so I &apos;ll repeat it , so , if you like problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , I want to go to every 21 billion hours a week for about 21 billion hours a week .
That &apos;s the end of the decade . No , I mean , I &apos;m really serious .
Why ? This image describes pretty much .
Why I think games are so essential to the survival of the human species in the future .
This is a <unk> of photographers called <unk> <unk> .
He wanted to capture the emotion of play . So it &apos;s a camera building a camera .
This is one of the classical expressions in play .
If you &apos;re not a player , you might just take some of the nuances in this picture .
You probably see this sense of urgency , a little bit of a <unk> , but also <unk> concentration , a really difficult problem to solve .
Now , if you &apos;re also playing , you &apos;ll see some of the nuances that look up , and your mouth is a sign of optimism . The eyebrows show up .
This is a players who are on the edge of a so-called <unk> <unk> .
Oh , you know , you know . OK .
So we have some players here .
A <unk> victory is a result which is so extremely positive that you didn &apos;t even realize it could ever .
It was almost the imagination of the imagination , and if you reach it , you &apos;re in shock .
You know , you can actually , in fact . That &apos;s a <unk> victory .
And this player &apos;s a <unk> victory .
And this is what we have to look like on millions of faces of <unk> around the world when we take the hurdles of the next century , and the face of the face of the <unk> on the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
Well , unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing this face in real life when we encounter a difficult problem .
I refer to it as a &quot; In life I &apos;m bad . &quot;
And it &apos;s actually my face , see ? Yes ?
That &apos;s me , like , &quot; In life , I &apos;m bad . &quot;
This is a graffiti in my former village in Berkeley , California , where I started studying in my PhD days why we are better than in real life .
That &apos;s a problem which many players have .
We think that we &apos;re not as good as in games .
And I don &apos;t just have less successful , even though that &apos;s all that .
We &apos;re going to be able to reach more .
I mean , I &apos;m good at doing with motivation trying to make a difference , inspired by collaboration .
When we &apos;re in a <unk> , I believe that many of us are going to turn into our best version , at anytime , and in fact , and we can <unk> the problem , so long as we need to try to go back and try to try to get it back after the <unk> .
And in reality , if we fail , when we hit obstacles , we often feel different .
We feel overwhelmed . We feel <unk> . We feel threatened , perhaps depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
These emotions have never , when we play games , in games , doesn &apos;t exist .
And this is what I wanted to look at as <unk> .
Why is it impossible to think , you can &apos;t just reach all the way ?
How can we take these feelings out of play in reality ?
So , I was looking for games like World of Warcraft , that &apos;s the ideal environment for how World and World Wide Web .
And I &apos;ve discovered some of the things that were able to make <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> so that &apos;s possible .
So , first of all , if you go into a <unk> , if you go on World of Warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are ready to go to you and you &apos;re ready to go to a <unk> mission .
But not just a mission , but a mission that fits perfectly with your current level , right ?
So you can do that .
They never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
But on the edge of your capabilities , you &apos;ve got to work .
But there &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft , because you don &apos;t sit around , you know , and <unk> . There &apos;s always been something important .
And there are <unk> collaborators .
So wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with you to finish your epic mission .
That &apos;s what we have , in true life , not so easy , this feeling of <unk> <unk> staff .
And also , there &apos;s this epic history , this inspirational story , why we are there and what we have , then we get this whole positive feedback .
You know , they &apos;ve heard of scale up and &quot; + 1 . &quot;
This is feedback feedback doesn &apos;t exist in true life .
Now , when I leave this stage , I don &apos;t have , + 1 . + 1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
I don &apos;t get my life in real life .
So , the problem of how World or Warcraft is , it &apos;s so that it &apos;s so gratifying , at anytime , on the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we prefer to spend our time in these <unk> .
They &apos;re just better than the reality .
But today , all the world or <unk> million years ago combined for millions of years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
That &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
It sounds bad .
But to see , in context , <unk> million years ago , it started to go to our first <unk> .
So that &apos;s the first <unk> primate .
Okay , so , so when we talk about how much time we spend on play , it &apos;s just a sense of the time , when you have time at the scale of human evolution , what &apos;s extremely extraordinary .
But it &apos;s appropriate , because it turns out that we use these whole time on play , actually , actually , in terms of what we can do as humans .
We &apos;re evolving to collaborative <unk> , so creatures .
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s what I think .
Now look at this interesting statistic that recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University : The average young person of today &apos;s lives in a country has spent 10,000 hours playing video games to the 21st century .
So , 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
First of all , for kids in the United States , it &apos;s <unk> hours that they spend on school , from the fifth grade high school -- if you never have to go . So we &apos;ve got a complete complete <unk> here -- so we have a complete complete <unk> .
<unk> to young people as well as all this means to be a good player , like anything else they learn in school .
And maybe some of you may have a new book of Malcolm <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
It &apos;s based on the great research that &apos;s based on how we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> at the time of a matter of the subject to the 21st century , we &apos;ll get to <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s going to be like the most significant people in the world .
So what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
So the big question is : &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
Because if we could figure that out , we could never have had any potential of human potential .
So many people now have , in the world today , are spending at least one hour per day with <unk> .
These are our <unk> . 500 million people that are extremely good at doing in something .
And in the next decade , we have another billion players that are extremely good in what &apos;s really good .
If you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
In fact , the <unk> <unk> , which is the energy savings , and it &apos;s going to work on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , because players in the world , especially in India , can play online .
You &apos;d expect another billion players in the next decade .
That &apos;s a 1.5 billion players .
So , I started thinking , well , what it is to <unk> these games .
Here are the four things that I found . First , <unk> .
Okay , imagine how extreme <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is the desire , right now , to try to master a barrier , combined with belief that we have a <unk> hope of success .
Now , players still believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s worth it to all , and it &apos;s the same .
<unk> don &apos;t sit around .
<unk> are masters of social media .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more , after we have played with them , even if they &apos;ve had a little <unk> .
The reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone playing a game .
We trust that someone &apos;s time with us to think that the rules are <unk> , that we have to keep the same goal and keep going .
So , it allows the <unk> to grow , and trust and to cooperate .
As a result , we &apos;re going to build stronger social interaction .
<unk> productivity . Awesome .
You know , there &apos;s a reason why it &apos;s the <unk> or <unk> 22 hours a week , like <unk> .
The reason is that , if we &apos;re playing , we &apos;re actually happier than if we &apos;re going to relax , if we relax , or not .
We know that we work as human beings , if we have a hard time , is a big job .
And players are always ready when they get the right to work .
And eventually epic significance .
players love it to be part of <unk> missions to be able to be able to scale up .
Here &apos;s a <unk> , to try to bring this back to light , and you know all the Wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
The second largest <unk> project in the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> project , is World of Warcraft .
Five million people use it every month .
They have more information about World of Warcraft via World of Warcraft in the Internet than any other subject in the world .
They create a epic history .
They create a epic source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft .
Okay , so these are four key principles that lead to one outcome , players are <unk> , <unk> individuals .
These are people who think they can change the world .
And the only problem is that they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real thing .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
Edward <unk> is a <unk> .
His work is ingenious . He &apos;s studying why it &apos;s
People so a lot of time , energy and cash in <unk> .
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re not getuige of less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
And this is a economist . So it makes sense .
And he says , not like I -- I &apos;m making games , I &apos;m a little bit more <unk> .
So he &apos;s actually saying that it makes sense , because players can achieve more than in real life .
They can connect to socially social bonds like in real life . They get more feedback and rewards in games like real life .
So , he &apos;s saying it &apos;s right now , that players have more time in the virtual world than in real time .
I first agree , it &apos;s logical .
But it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
We need to begin to turn the world into a game .
My inspiration comes from an event that 2,500 years .
There are these little cubes , from <unk> . You know ?
And this amazing <unk> was <unk> .
And that &apos;s sort of the first of people developed <unk> , and when you &apos;re familiar with the old Greek Greek <unk> -- you might know this story . The story about how and why games had been invented .
According to <unk> , games , more <unk> , in the Kingdom of <unk> during the Kingdom of a famine .
And so there was a huge famine that was so that the king of <unk> himself was a crazy idea .
People suffer . These people fought .
It was an extreme situation . You needed an extreme solution .
So , they invented , according to <unk> , <unk> and <unk> a national strategy . On a day , you would be going to play . The next day you would play .
And they &apos;re going to be a big part of the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and us with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would forget that there was no food .
And then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
And according to <unk> survived , they survived for 18 years , because they ate the day and they played the next .
Likewise , I think we &apos;re going to play games today .
We put games together to escape the suffering of true world , and we sit games , so we don &apos;t work in the real world in the real world , all that in the real life , and we get what we need to take from play .
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
That &apos;s the <unk> .
According to <unk> , after 18 years old , the famine didn &apos;t better . So the king decided to <unk> .
They divided the Kingdom of two .
They played a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> was able to break a <unk> adventure .
They came to <unk> , and they went to search for a new home . They just left so many people back to how it was going to survive and looking for the rest of an area where they could thrive .
That sounds crazy , right ?
But in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , show that the <unk> , which later , came to the <unk> realm that later , which is the same DNA as the ancient <unk> .
So recently , scientists came to see a crazy story .
And geologists have been found evidence of a global web that was almost 20 years old , which was almost 20 years old .
So this is a crazy story .
Maybe they were able to save their people through play with 18 years in games , and then they had these <unk> <unk> , and then they had so much about to interact with that all the civilization .
So , we can also .
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for in 1994 .
This was the first time in real time in real time .
The World of <unk> . This was 16 years ago .
You know , you know , they played for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing on for 16 years .
I &apos;m saying we are ready for our own infinite game .
So , they send half of their civilization to search for a new world , so I take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
We should say , in fact , that half of us spend an hour a hour by play with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems in the real world .
I know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot;
In games ? &quot; And exactly this question I &apos;ve spent my work on the <unk> Institute for the future .
We &apos;ve got this <unk> in our office in Palo Alto , and it expresses how to understand the future .
We don &apos;t want to try to say to the future .
What we want to do is create the future .
We want to introduce the best outcome , and then people empower it to take this idea in reality .
We give us <unk> <unk> , and give people the opportunity to reach it .
So , I &apos;m going to show you just three games that I designed to try to try to put people in their own future .
This is a world without oil .
The game is 2007 .
It &apos;s a <unk> where you have to cross a <unk> .
The <unk> is fiction , but we &apos;ve got enough <unk> , so you can actually live a real life without any oil . So , if you go to <unk> , you can tell us where you live , and then you get <unk> in real time , which is not how <unk> are <unk> , what it doesn &apos;t have , how much oil was <unk> , what it &apos;s not .
So , how to behave , if schools are closed , whether there &apos;s <unk> . And you &apos;ve got to figure out how to create your real life if it was true , and we &apos;re asking you to write videos or <unk> .
We &apos;ve tested this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been running them since over the last three years .
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience .
No one wants to be able to change life , because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
But if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure , and I said , &quot; We go to the oil . &quot;
This is a fascinating adventure that you can go .
Find how you would survive . Most of our players have changed the game in the game .
So , we &apos;ve got a bigger game on the next <unk> game , more goal than just <unk> .
We &apos;ve developed a game called <unk> at the University of the future .
It &apos;s the point of view of the calculation that people have just 23 years on the planet .
This supercomputer is called <unk> <unk> .
The appeal to players , you know , is <unk> , we have almost like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You know , you know , Jerry <unk> , where there &apos;s this &quot; <unk> &quot; , you &apos;ve got the astronaut , you know , and you can just save the world .
But in our game , instead of just five people , every five people , say , everybody is in <unk> , and it &apos;s our job to create food , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played it for eight weeks .
They found 500 creative solutions that you can read , if you can read &quot; <unk> &quot; .
And the last game we take on March 3.
And if you finish the game , you get from the World Bank , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We work with universities in large sub-Saharan Africa , and invite it to teach them to learn social media .
We have a comic book . We &apos;ve got <unk> understanding , for pure understanding , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
So , I want you to all share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in <unk> , and all of them are going to work together to save their own social enterprises to save the world .
So now I come to the end .
Let me just ask you .
What do you think next ?
We have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the world yet .
Well , I hope you agree that the human resources are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big sense of transformation .
We have this whole <unk> , <unk> productivity , the ability to engage deeply separate social network , <unk> and <unk> .
And I really hope that we can play together a major game to survive on this planet .
And I hope you &apos;ll play these play with me and play .
When I look back in the next decade , I &apos;m sure two things , I &apos;m sure that we can create every conceivable future , and that we can play all kinds of games , so I &apos;ll tell you how to play games .
Thank you .
So for some time , I &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> , and it may seem strange that a magician actually is interested in it , because , you know , you look , you know , as a delusion , when someone thinks it &apos;s enough enough .
In other words , <unk> <unk> has shown in some studies a <unk> effect , which is , because the person thinks what &apos;s going to happen to her , or a sort of -- in <unk> , for example , for example , if the patient just enough enough , a <unk> effect in the body , which is called the <unk> <unk> in the body , which is called the <unk> <unk> .
A delusion will be <unk> because someone knows it .
So , in order for us to understand each other , I want to show you a very simple , very simple trick .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick that at least ever since the 1950s in every museum .
I learned him from the <unk> Magic Magic to <unk> in the 1970s .
I &apos;m going to explain it to you and explain it .
And then I &apos;ll explain why I explain it .
So , see what happens .
The knives that you can look , my hand that you can investigate .
I &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my hand .
I <unk> my sleeves back .
And to make sure that there &apos;s nothing in my sleeves or out there , I &apos;m just going to just take my wrist exactly right here .
So , in this way , you can see no time there &apos;s no time anything , so long as I can go , nothing can go into my sleeves , or come out .
And the goal of this is very simple .
I &apos;m going to open your hand , and hopefully , if all well works , the knives of <unk> magnetism would take magnetism .
In fact , this is actually stuck with its place , without knowing the knife .
Nothing to go into my sleeve , or come out , not <unk> . And you can go all the way through .
<unk> !
Now , this is a trick I often <unk> little kids who are interested in magic , because you can really learn a lot about deception if you look carefully , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
You probably know many of you in this room in this trick .
It &apos;s how it works .
I hold the knife in my hand .
I &apos;m saying I &apos;m going to take my wrist to make sure that there &apos;s no way of disappear or coming out of it , and it &apos;s a lie .
The reason why I <unk> my wrist , is that it &apos;s the secret of illusion .
Because , in the moment , where I &apos;m going to take you from you , so you can see her fingers , this finger , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position where he was so <unk> .
<unk> ?
On the back of the back , someone who had no childhood .
So , he &apos;s there .
And when I <unk> me , it changes its position .
And now , you might be able to reason why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are just three fingers : because the mind , and how it &apos;s information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three , but it &apos;s as groups .
But this isn &apos;t all right here , and then I open my hand .
Of course it will hold it on , but not through the magnetism , but through a trick of my body , through my <unk> , it &apos;s there .
And when I close my hand , this is the same thing by hand , through this movement , that &apos;s hidden away from this movement .
I take this hand . And here &apos;s the knife .
That trick can take your friends and neighbors . Thank you .
Now what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
So a year ago , I was reading a study ago .
I &apos;m not a doctor or scientist , and so that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing .
Because it turns out that if you put a placebo in form of a white pill , in the form of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round , white tablet .
But if you give the shape to the <unk> , for example , in example , in a smaller pill , it &apos;s going to change the blue one , and a letter to it , is actually measurable .
And even though none of this <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
But a white pill is not good as a blue pill .
What ? This made me crazy .
But it turned out it &apos;s not all .
When you take <unk> , it &apos;s even more powerful than any shape .
A colored capsule , which is a end of yellow , and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
The <unk> plays a role .
A pill twice a day , isn &apos;t twice as good as three pills -- I can &apos;t remember the statistics .
But this is important .

And the shape plays a role .
And if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to grab the needle .
Right ? A syringe with a <unk> -- some <unk> -- some <unk> substance that you put to your patient .
This is a very powerful picture in your head . That &apos;s a lot more stronger than a white pill .
This chart is actually , I &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a <unk> <unk> .
So it &apos;s the fact that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem to be so good , like the blue pill that doesn &apos;t sound like a capsule which doesn &apos;t work like the needle .
And none of this has a really profound trait . It &apos;s just our belief that in a stronger impact .
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick .
I &apos;m going to take something that &apos;s obviously a delusion , and it &apos;s going to look really like this .
We know in this study that you have to reach to the needle when it &apos;s supposed to go .
This is 18 inches long . She &apos;s very , very , very , very <unk> . And I &apos;m going to take it a little bit of <unk> .
This is really my flesh . It &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat .
This is my skin . That &apos;s not a <unk> of Hollywood .
Now , I &apos;m going to put this needle into my skin , and I &apos;m going to go through them , until they put on the other side .
If you get a <unk> -- if you fall into <unk> -- I did a couple of my friends last night in room , and some people that I didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s a woman almost <unk> .
So , I &apos;m suggesting that if you &apos;re going to get fast and go away , you go to the next 30 seconds . Or , you know , I &apos;m going to take the first <unk> part in the back here .
You can see it in the same way , but you can also <unk> , if you want to .
So , this is how my flesh starts , on the lower part of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
I &apos;m sorry . Is it crazy ?
And now just a little bit of a little bit from my skin and on the other side .
Now we are in the same situation that we had in the <unk> .
<unk> .
But now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
So , I &apos;m going to show you . That &apos;s one , two , three , four , five .
Well , yeah .
I know what people think when they &apos;re seeing this .
They say , &quot; Okay , so it &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> yourself , just to talk the skin , just to talk a few minutes . &quot;
Now , I &apos;m going to show it to you .
What does this look like ? Pretty good .
Yes , I know . And the people in the back are saying , &quot; Okay . I haven &apos;t seen this . &quot;
These people in the <unk> are coming in .
Let me show you the outside .
That &apos;s my skin . That &apos;s not a <unk> of Hollywood .
That &apos;s my flesh , and I can be the <unk> .
I &apos;m sorry . If you &apos;re going to go away , look , don &apos;t look away .
People in the back , or they &apos;ll look at some video clips , they &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , this looks a bit impressive , but if it would really be , look , this is a hole , and it &apos;s going to bleed there if it really was , it would bleed . &quot;
Okay , let me just take a little blood for you .
Yes , this is .
Normally , I would take the needle out .
I would love my arm clean , and show you that there are no wounds .
But I think , in this framework , I &apos;m thinking , in this framework , I &apos;m going to try to make a <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m going to just take the needle and come from the stage , and so on .
We &apos;re going to see a few times a few times .
I hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . Thank you very much .
So I used a lot of fish in my life .
I just loved two .
This first one , which was more like a passionate <unk> .
It was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
What &apos;s a fish .
Even better , it was in <unk> , after the top standards of sustainability .
So you could feel comfortable with it .
I had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
One day , the CEO of a company called a company and he asked if I could tell you about the future of the farm .
&quot; Of course . &quot;
Here was a company to try to solve the problem of our chefs .
In the last 50 years , we have taken out the oceans how to <unk> forests .
It &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , who we love , who we love , tuna , <unk> , <unk> , they have collapsed .
There &apos;s almost nothing left .
So , I think it &apos;s going to be <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
There &apos;s a lot of arguments . <unk> contaminated the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , and they are inefficient .
He &apos;s got a <unk> of 15 to one .
That means , 15 pounds of <unk> are required to make a pound .
Not very sustainable .
<unk> not very good .
So here was a company which was trying to make it right .
I wanted to support them .
On the day before , I phoned the <unk> <unk> for the company .
Let &apos;s call it Don &apos;t .
&quot; Don &apos;t say , &quot; I said , &quot; just to have the facts , you &apos;re famous for how to grow up in the ocean , so you don &apos;t get rid of the environment . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s true . &quot;
And then he added , &quot; We are essentially in a world .
These <unk> from 2.5 one , he said .
&quot; The best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 one , excellent .
&quot; So it was ? &quot;
<unk> proteins , he said .
&quot; Great . &quot;
And that night , I was in bed , and I thought , what &apos;s a hell of a natural protein ?
So I called the next day , just before the event , Don &apos;t .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t be sustainable ? &quot;
He said he didn &apos;t know it . He &apos;s going to <unk> .
Now , I <unk> with a couple of people in the company . No one was able to answer me , and until finally with the senior biologists .
Let &apos;s call it Don &apos;t .

Now he called some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and food . &quot;
I said , &quot; How much of <unk> <unk> <unk> chicken ? &quot;
In terms of maybe two percent .
&quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent . &quot;
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t you eat a chicken ? &quot;
There was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just a lot of chicken in the world . &quot;
I <unk> this fish .
No , not , because I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
That &apos;s me even .
No , I &apos;m actually <unk> out of this fish , because , I swear , I swear to God , you know , I swear to you .
This is a second type of <unk> .
It &apos;s the romantic type , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know the fish .
I ate it first in a restaurant in <unk> .
A <unk> journalist had spoken about this fish .
It &apos;s a sense of <unk> .
He came to the table with a bright , <unk> white color .
The chef had sold it .
<unk> twice .
<unk> was still delicious .
Who can taste a fish so well after he sold it ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
Call it Miguel . In fact , it &apos;s Miguel .
And no , he didn &apos;t take the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . At least in the way , it &apos;s not a chef .
He &apos;s a biologist in <unk> La <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> corner .
It &apos;s near the <unk> of the river .
In the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
They raised food <unk> on what was essentially <unk> .
They did that by the country .
They built this complicated suite of canals like <unk> from the country , and out of the river out there ,
Now they couldn &apos;t make sure that it worked , not economically .
And green was a catastrophe .
It was about 90 percent of the birds , what many birds are .
And that &apos;s a Spanish firm called a Spanish firm ,
What did they do ?
You have the flow of the water back .
They literally <unk> the levers .
Instead of using water , they used to use them to <unk> water .
They <unk> the channels .
They created a <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and there &apos;s Miguel and his firm and his firm completely reversed .
The farm is incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
You know , you know , when you look at the horizon that &apos;s a million miles away , and all they &apos;re seeing are <unk> channels , and this dense , <unk> hike .
I was not there at any time with Miguel .
He &apos;s a wonderful guy , three parts Charles Darwin and a part of a crocodile .
Okay ? There was us , and we fought by the <unk> , and I was <unk> and <unk> , <unk> up till my knees , and Miguel keeps going on a <unk> .
Here &apos;s a rare <unk> .
Now I mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
And here , there &apos;s a pattern of <unk> <unk> that it reminds him of the <unk> giraffe .
It turns out that Miguel is the largest part of your career in <unk> national park in Africa .
I asked him how to become a <unk> .
He said , &quot; Fish ? I don &apos;t know about fish .
I &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
And then it goes into a bit of a <unk> of rare birds and algae and strange <unk> .
And don &apos;t take me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , so in the way .
It &apos;s great , but I was in love .
And my head was very weak about this selling piece of <unk> <unk> that I had at the <unk> .
So I was interrupted it . I said , &quot; Miguel , how is it so that your fish tastes so good ? &quot;
He showed up on the algae .
&quot; I know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , which is incredible .
But what &apos;s eating your fish ?
Who &apos;s the <unk> ? &quot;
Now he &apos;s going to keep telling me that it &apos;s such a <unk> system that &apos;s eating what they eat in the wild .
The <unk> biomass , the phytoplankton , <unk> , it &apos;s what the fish feeds .
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
There &apos;s no food .
You heard from a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
Later on the day , I was going to go on this site with Miguel and I asked him , I said , &quot; To a place so , &quot; unlike every farm I had ever been ?
At the moment , it was like if there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we looked around the corner and our bone was the most incredible sight , and it &apos;s thousands and thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk> , literally <unk> carpet .
&quot; That &apos;s success . &quot;
&quot; Look at your <unk> , pink .
They <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? I was completely confused .
I said , &quot; Miguel , don &apos;t you take your fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
Now , last year on this site was 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
It &apos;s the largest one , and one of the most important private parts of the entire continent in Europe .
I said , &quot; Miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last that you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
He shook his head , no .
He said , &quot; We don &apos;t build <unk> .
This is a <unk> network .
The <unk> eats shrimp food .
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
So the more <unk> the gut of the belly of the system . &quot;
Okay , let &apos;s rethink that . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed her animals , and a farm they measure their success on the health of their predators .
A <unk> , but also a <unk> .
Oh , and , by the way , this <unk> of <unk> can &apos;t even be there .
They &apos;re breeding in a city of 240 kilometers away from where it &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> .
Every morning they go to 240 kilometers to farm .
And every night they go back to 240 kilometers .
They &apos;re doing this because it can follow the <unk> white line of <unk> <unk> .
Seriously .
So I had introduced some sort of journey of penguins , so I looked at Miguel .
I said , &quot; Miguel , they go to 240 kilometers to the farm , and then they go to 240 kilometers ?
Do they do it for the kids ? &quot;
He looked at me , as if I had a song on Whitney Houston .
He said , &quot; No . You &apos;re doing this because food is better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and I don &apos;t like it . I don &apos;t like it .
It &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
I never <unk> it .
And yet , when I put it in a restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t have to <unk> it .
That &apos;s sweet and <unk> , if you take a bite from the ocean .
I mentioned this over Miguel and <unk> .
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a <unk> .
She &apos;s the last <unk> before something in the body .
It evolved over evolution in the evolution of <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And then he added , &quot; But our water didn &apos;t have a <unk> . &quot;
Okay . A farm they don &apos;t feed their fish , a farm they measure her success on the success of their predators .
And then I realized when he says , if he says , you don &apos;t have a <unk> , because the water that goes through this farm comes from the stream <unk> in the stream .
It &apos;s a river that &apos;s going to lead all of these things , right now , to lead the chemical pollutants , <unk> from <unk> .
And when it fought through the system , and it leaves the water cleaner when it &apos;s <unk> .
The system is so healthy , it cleans water .
So not just a farm which doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm they measure on the health of their predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a <unk> , and not just for those fish , it &apos;s not just for those fish , but it &apos;s also .
Because if the water <unk> , it <unk> it in the Atlantic .
A drop in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;m going to take it to you , and I want you to do , because this <unk> , like romantic , is also <unk> .
You might say , it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk to <unk> or <unk> .
What we need is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one in which it actually tastes good .
But for many people , this is a little too radical .
We are not <unk> , we <unk> . We are <unk> .
We love <unk> . We love small <unk> . We are talking about local food . We eat food .
And if you say , that &apos;s the thing that the future of good food is someone who puts someone on and said , &quot; Hey people , I love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
How are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
Is it fair ?
I don &apos;t like this question .
No , not because it &apos;s enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding the world .
A billion people will be hungry today .
A billion -- this is more than you before -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
Now , I don &apos;t like this question , because it &apos;s the logic of our diet for the last 50 years ?
<unk> crops to <unk> , <unk> to <unk> chemicals , chemicals on the Earth , and all of the time it &apos;s <unk> : &quot; If we feed more people , how awful this is ? &quot;
That was the cause . It was the <unk> . It was the <unk> of American agriculture .
We should call it what it is , a <unk> <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s capital that creates exactly the same production .
That &apos;s not a <unk> , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
Our <unk> today is threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
Not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through <unk> country , not from pumps , but through fresh water , not through <unk> , but through forests , through forests , not through <unk> and <unk> , but through the ocean in the ocean .
You want to feed the world ?
Let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
Or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
To do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
<unk> , chemistry , and machines are <unk> , and it never made a good food for food .
Let &apos;s look at the green model .
That &apos;s that , for two billion years , <unk> <unk> .
Look at Miguel , farmers like Miguel .
Companies that don &apos;t exist worlds , they are designed to repair factories in terms of <unk> , businesses that don &apos;t grow food , farmers who are not just <unk> , but experts for relationships are not just <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are those who are experts on flavor .
And when I &apos;m really honest , it &apos;s a better chef than I &apos;m going to you .
You know , this is me right , because if that &apos;s good food , it will be delicious .
Thank you .
I grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
In my high school day , I was driving to school every day every day .
And my nose , I was in a book , was in a book , and it was <unk> that my thoughts in other worlds , and in <unk> way , <unk> curiosity .
Now this was also clear that I was like , if I wasn &apos;t in the school , through the forests , walking and collecting , <unk> , frogs , frogs and snakes , and <unk> and <unk> , everything was home , and looked under the microscope .
I was completely <unk> , you know .
It was all about trying to understand the world and understand the limits of what it was possible .
And my love for science fiction seemed to be in my environment , because then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and <unk> the sea .
Jacques Cousteau came out in our living rooms with his fascinating shows that we showed animals and places and a world full of miracles that we never could ever have before .
That &apos;s probably going to be good at the <unk> <unk> .
And I was an artist .
I was able to draw . I could draw .
And because it didn &apos;t have video games like <unk> movies with <unk> movies , all the <unk> movies in the media landscape , I had to create the images in my head .
We had to all , in the past , when we were reading a book , we took the description of the <unk> and <unk> it on the canvas in our heads .
My response to it was to draw alien , alien worlds , alien worlds , robots , <unk> , etc .
In <unk> , I was getting caught by the teacher &apos;s teacher , like me , in the back textbook , <unk> .
The creativity was supposed to be .
And something interesting happened , which fascinated me by Jacques <unk> shows , was the idea of a completely unknown world on our Earth today .
Certainly , I &apos;d never reach a alien world with a spaceship , and that seemed fairly unlikely .
But here was a world I could actually enter the Earth , and it was just fascinating and exotic as all that I had ever introduced when I had read these books .
So , I decided to become a <unk> .
The only problem was that I lived in a small village in Canada , 1,000 kilometers away from the nearest ocean .
But of course , I didn &apos;t take it away .
I <unk> my father , until finally , a <unk> at Buffalo , New York , found that on the other side of the line , where we lived .
I was doing my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the winter in Buffalo , New York .
But the ocean , this was a real ocean , first two years later , when we moved to California .
Since then , in the 40 years that now have been <unk> , I spent about 3,000 hours underwater . 500 hours of it in <unk> .
And I &apos;ve learned that the world of deep ocean , even in the <unk> oceans , is so rich in life , as we really can &apos;t really imagine .
The nature of nature knows not all boundaries , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
In my days , I feel deepest awe for what I see on my <unk> .
And my love for the ocean continues , with the same intensity , like , and you .
When I was an <unk> as well as an <unk> , it was the <unk> .
That seemed to be the best way , my inner urge to tell me about how to create images , to try to mix images .
As a child as a child , I drew <unk> and so on .
So , there were movies and stories together to bring images together .
Of course , the stories that I was out of , from the <unk> : &quot; Terminator . &quot;
In terms of <unk> , I was able to connect to the <unk> and diving into diving with the <unk> .
So , sort of ties my two passions .
Something interesting happened in terms of <unk> : To try to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- so that we had to create a sort of liquid <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , back .
What &apos;s coming out was the first <unk> <unk> <unk> to see you in a movie .
The film didn &apos;t take any money , right before he played his <unk> , but I noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world like <unk> from the magic , which came out .
According to Arthur Clarke &apos;s Law , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , <unk> technology , and magic is no longer different .
So you saw some <unk> .
And this was incredibly exciting .
And I was like , &quot; Wow , that must be in the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
So in &quot; Terminator 2 &quot; , my next film , a lot more .
Together with <unk> , we created this guy out of liquid metal . The success depended on how this effect would arrive .
And it worked . Again , we had created something called a <unk> , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve had a little more money on the movie .
From these two experiences , there was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
So , I started a firm firm , along with my good physicist , Winston Winston , who was at the time of the best <unk> and <unk> .
Now , the idea of this firm was that <unk> processes with visual self-assembly process , etc . , etc .
That &apos;s what we did , and then we <unk> it as well as a time .
But in fact , in the mid- &apos; 90s , we discovered that in <unk> and <unk> -- which was that we actually founded the company -- too slow .
I wrote this piece of &quot; Avatar , &quot; which was the <unk> in visual effects and <unk> effects on new heights , with <unk> human , <unk> characters that were produced by <unk> and <unk> characters , and the world should be <unk> .
But the <unk> came back back , and people in my firm told me that we couldn &apos;t be able to be able to do that .
So , I <unk> this , and I made this other movie about the big boat that goes back .
The <unk> , I was selling this as &quot; Romeo and Juliet on a ship &quot; , and it was a <unk> <unk> dimension , a passionate movie .
But in fact , I was actually interested in the <unk> <unk> of the Titanic .
That &apos;s why I did .
That &apos;s the truth . The studio didn &apos;t know .
But I &apos;ve convinced them , by saying , &quot; We &apos;re going to go to the <unk> . We film the real <unk> .
We &apos;ll show it in the movie movie .
That &apos;s very important . It &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
And I <unk> it to fund an expedition .
Sounds crazy . But this goes back back to back to your imagination .
So , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , six months later , I created a reality where I was in a Russian <unk> , four kilometers beneath the surface of the <unk> , and I looked into the real Titanic by looking at a <unk> <unk> .
This was not a movie , not high , not high .
So , this blew my mind .
And the <unk> was huge . We had to build cameras and our house .
And I noticed how this <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
Well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
You &apos;re going to go into this capsule , then you just floating in this dark , <unk> environment , where there &apos;s no hope for saving it , if you can &apos;t take it back .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s just as if I was in a <unk> .
That &apos;s really cool . &quot;
I was obsessed with exploring the deep sea of the sea .
In fact , from the part of that to science and science , it was all this . It was curiosity , it was curiosity . It was imagination .
And it was an experience that could not give me Hollywood .
Because , you know , I was able to imagine a character that we could create a visual effect , but I couldn &apos;t imagine what I saw outside of the <unk> .
In some of those expeditions , I &apos;ve seen things in <unk> , and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things had never seen before and the science at the time , when we saw them , when we saw they had no words before .
So this made me realize , and I wanted more .
And so I had a slightly unusual decision .
After the success of the Titanic , I said , &quot; Okay , I want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in Hollywood on ice cream , and I &apos;m going to <unk> for a while . &quot;
And then we started to plan these expeditions .
We came to see &quot; <unk> . &quot;
We went back to the <unk> of the Titanic .
We used little robots that we had built on that <unk> <unk> .
Our intent was to see , <unk> and to look at the inside of the <unk> thing , which was never done before .
No one had to explore the inside of it . You had no tools for it . So we developed the technology .
After all , I &apos;m sitting on a deck of the Titanic , and I &apos;m sitting there in a <unk> , and I look at the <unk> , which is quite similar , and I know that the tape that &apos;s played .
And I &apos;m flying with a little <unk> through the <unk> <unk> .
Actually , I &apos;m actually <unk> it , but my consciousness is in the <unk> .
It felt like I was physically in the <unk> of the Titanic .
This was the <unk> form of a <unk> that I &apos;ve ever experienced , because before I went back to a corner , I always knew exactly what &apos;s going to be in the <unk> of the <unk> , because I was going to put a film on the Earth .
The set was a very different copy of the <unk> of <unk> .
So this was a very strange experience .
She made me realize this <unk> that you can use such a <unk> <unk> , so your own consciousness in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
It was really immensely profound .
And maybe a little bit of a look at what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> <unk> to explore something or other things , in all sorts of things , in all sorts of other forms of <unk> that I can imagine as <unk> .
After these expeditions , we started to see what we &apos;ve seen at the bottom , for example , for example , these <unk> animals , where we saw these incredibly beautiful animals -- these are kind of alien animals , but here on Earth .
They live with the help of <unk> .
They don &apos;t exist in one of the sunlight , how to do that .
And so you can see animals that are right next to 500 degrees Fahrenheit .
<unk> live . And you can &apos;t imagine that it can survive .
At the same time , I was also very interested in <unk> , which was the <unk> of my childhood .
And so I ended up with people who are interested in space and trying to sit with NASA , and in the <unk> , and right , you go to Russia , and you &apos;re going to go to Russia , through the mission , through the mission , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , then take our <unk> <unk> and take our <unk> .
That was fascinating .
But in the end , it was out there that I took <unk> with us in the deep sea .
I took them to access to the Internet , and I put it in the world : <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in these extreme conditions , and I took it to the information so that they could look around and test instruments , and so on .
We were doing <unk> , but in fact , in fact , it &apos;s doing science , more recently : <unk> .
That &apos;s what &apos;s going on between my existence as <unk> , then as a child , and the <unk> in reality .
In the process , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science , but I learned a lot about <unk> .
Now , you know , you &apos;ve got to have to go to a director and be a leader like a <unk> , or so .
But I didn &apos;t understand a lot of the lead , before I <unk> these expeditions .
Because at a point where I had to say , &quot; What am I doing here ?
Why do I do this ? What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
These <unk> movies don &apos;t make any money .
We &apos;re just going to play the <unk> . It &apos;s not a trace .
All thinking , I mean , I &apos;m between the Titanic and &quot; Avatar &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; , somewhere on the <unk> on the beach .
I have all these movies , this <unk> , for a very small audience .
No fame , no credit , no money . What are you doing ?
You know , you want to take it to the challenge , and the ocean is the <unk> environment that it &apos;s there , and you &apos;re doing it because of the <unk> , and because of the weird connection , that &apos;s when a small group of people .
Because , in fact , we &apos;ve done all over 10 to 12 people who worked for years long . Sometimes we &apos;ve been working on two to three months in a row .
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing that you have , you know , because you have a challenge to you , because you can overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain .
When you go back to country and say , &quot; We had to do it , the <unk> , and all the technology , and the difficulty , the human <unk> , when you go to See , you can &apos;t explain the other , and that &apos;s like with policemen , you know , it &apos;s not a person .
There &apos;s a connection there , which is a <unk> respect .
So , when I came back to <unk> my next film , I was trying to use the same <unk> , which is that you are respected , you would love your team and respect .
This led to the dynamic .
So , I came back with a little team on <unk> terrain . We turned &quot; Avatar &quot; with a new technology that &apos;s not yet .
<unk> exciting .
A huge challenge .
And we &apos;ve been in a row of four and a half years to a time .
That &apos;s how to make movies , completely .
There were people who were saying we could have this <unk> <unk> and transported back to Pandora .
To me , it was more like a <unk> way of doing my job , which is the actual process that changed the outcome .
So what can we end up with ?
What lessons have we learned ?
I think that &apos;s the first place that &apos;s curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful human trait .
Our imagination is a power that can actually create a reality .
And the <unk> of your teams is more important than all of this world .
To me , my young filmmaker who says , &quot; Give me some advice that I can do . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t you take yourself .
That &apos;s another thing for you . You don &apos;t , don &apos;t care , you don &apos;t even notice , but take risks on you . &quot;
NASA has a <unk> : &quot; Scheitern is not an alternative . &quot;
But in the arts and research , it has to be an alternative , because there &apos;s no doubt there will be a <unk> .
Not very important , which was innovation demanded , without looking at risk .
You &apos;ve got to be ready to take these risks .
That &apos;s the thought that I &apos;d like to leave you with , and it &apos;s not a solution , but it &apos;s not all .
Now , if you want to take one thing today , it &apos;s the full of data that we consume , bigger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking to <unk> , I want you to think about how we can use information , and we &apos;re going to recognize these trends that don &apos;t have to be visible to patterns .
So what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> <unk> after age .
The program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called <unk> , and what I can do with <unk> is that I can filter it after a specific cause of death , we can say crashes .
And immediately , I look at another pattern here , which is that it &apos;s going to happen .
And that &apos;s because in the <unk> , there are the people on the <unk> , and they &apos;re on the <unk> .
We can go back a step further , and we can go back to the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
Now , if you go further and go to the age of 40 years , we &apos;ll see 40 years old , we &apos;ll see that crashes even be the <unk> of the people in the world .
And who <unk> it is that this is true , this is true with men .
So , you know , you know , the reputation of information and data can remind you of swimming in a living and <unk> <unk> .
And what if we can do this for the data why doesn &apos;t it apply to content ?
Now , what we &apos;ve got here are the <unk> version of every single one , which was ever printed .
It &apos;s all there . It &apos;s all online .
You know , you can see it in your lab in your lab .
In terms of <unk> , they can be in a decade .
You can dive into a particular year .
You can jump right into a specific copy .
Now , if I look , I &apos;m seeing the athletes that appear to be in this issue , and the sports .
So , I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> , so I &apos;m <unk> , so I &apos;m going to show you what <unk> Armstrong was mentioned before .
Now , if I want to take you just a quick overview of what &apos;s going on , I could think , &quot; Okay , what if I look at everything with the issue ? &quot;
So , I &apos;m going to take a step back and <unk> the way .
Now I look at Greg <unk> .
And so , you get an idea of this idea that if you go to this type of information , <unk> , larger , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t just search and not just not just not just blind .
You know , what &apos;s interesting is a little bit different .
It &apos;s something between , and we think it changes how information can be used .
Now , I want this idea to take a little bit more , just a bit crazy .
What we &apos;ve done here is , we &apos;ve taken every single <unk> , and it reduced it to a little summary .
The summary of this is a short <unk> , and it &apos;s a symbol of it that comes out of it .
Let me just show you the top 500 of the <unk> <unk> .
But even in this <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
Immediately , we get a sense of the themes that &apos;s going to be on Wikipedia <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to pick up the issue of government .
Now , if I chose a &quot; government &quot; , I know that the <unk> , I know , the <unk> that &apos;s the most frequent <unk> &quot; people in the year &quot; ,
This is really important , because this is a realization which is not in a single <unk> .
That &apos;s just when you take a step back and look at the whole thing .
<unk> at a certain of those summaries , I can go back to this issue of Time magazine , and all this together .
Now , if I look at all those individuals , I know that the majority of them are <unk> . Some of them come from the science . Some of them , even less , come from the economy . Here &apos;s my boss .
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner .
So , what &apos;s interesting , we can go to all the TED Prize winners .
You can see , in the Web , the first time it &apos;s actually a web , not just from page to page , not just from page , but much more abstract .
And so , I want to show you what &apos;s other little surprise .
Let me just just show you the website of the New York Times .
<unk> , this application -- I don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really no browser , but you can see websites -- and we can bring these <unk> pages like this .
So , I can go back to a step , and directly jump into a specific <unk> .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s important , because you can just look at these types of websites in this way , in this way , the whole <unk> can look up on the same way .
So , I can zoom in , and I can zoom in on a particular time .
Here &apos;s the state of the entire demonstration that I &apos;ve given up here .
And I can tell you all that what I &apos;ve seen today , again , <unk> .
And , in fact , if I take a step back and look back , I can go back to the next , and I can go back to <unk> , and here , I &apos;m looking for <unk> , here for Bing Labs .
And from here , I can go to the site and go back to it .
It &apos;s a metaphor which is used back and forth every time , and every time it &apos;s bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
Now , right now , in this world , we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
We are talking about the <unk> of the <unk> .
We are talking about the store of information .
What if we could turn this situation into , and then the Internet , so that instead of going from a way to go from one to many things , start from many things to lots and lots of things to many things , which would be otherwise hidden ?
Now , if you can do this , it &apos;s going to be able to take a new source of information , maybe a new source of information .
And , instead of just getting just information in information , we can get rid of it .
And when we learn to experience , maybe maybe we can actually pull away from that .
So I &apos;m listening to , thank you very much .
Everyone talks about happiness today .
I &apos;ve given some people the number of books that were published with &quot; Happiness , &quot; which were published in the last five years , and they agreed to give them about 40 .
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
Everyone likes to make people happier .
But despite all of this flow of work , there are several cognitive cases that are almost impossible to think about happiness .
And my talk today , mainly , will act of this cognitive decline .
That &apos;s true for <unk> that over their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists to think about happiness , because it turns out that we are as well as all the other .
The first of these traps is to admit complexity .
It turns out that the word of happiness simply isn &apos;t a useful word anymore , because we apply it to many different things .
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just limit it , but in general , it &apos;s something that we need to be giving , and we need to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
The second trap is an experience of experience and memory : essentially , it &apos;s between happy life and happiness over their lives or happy life .
And these are two very different concepts , and they are both <unk> in the imagination of happiness .
And the third is the <unk> , and this is the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that we can &apos;t think of the well-being of the well-being without the meanings .
I mean , this is a true cognitive trap .
There &apos;s no way to get it right .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a <unk> <unk> after one of my lectures that was going to have a story , and it was perfectly wonderful music , and it was perfectly wonderful music , and at the end of the <unk> sound .
And then he added , really , really emotional , this has ruined the whole experience .
But this didn &apos;t .
What it was ruined was the memories of the experience .
He had the experience .
He had <unk> music for 20 minutes .
She didn &apos;t care because he was <unk> with a memory , and the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to hold .
What this really tells us is that we might think about us and over other people in the sense of two types of self .
There &apos;s a <unk> self which lives in the present moment , and in the present moment , in the present moment , in the present time , but in the presence of the present .
It &apos;s the <unk> self which is <unk> -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; Is it going to hurt if I &apos;m here ? &quot;
And then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the self is that , and it &apos;s the history of our lives , and it &apos;s the history of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to <unk> the question : &quot; How did you feel lately ? &quot;
or : &quot; How was your <unk> ? &quot;
These are two very different entities , the <unk> self , and the <unk> self , and it &apos;s the two people that are part of the <unk> of happiness .
Now , the self is a storyteller .
And this starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
We just don &apos;t just tell stories if we &apos;re making stories .
Our memory tells us stories , which is what we should be keeping from our <unk> .
And let &apos;s start with an example .
There &apos;s an old study .
These are true patients that are <unk> procedure .
I &apos;m not going to go into the details anymore , this is not painful , but it was painful when this trial was done in the 1990s .
They were asked to tell every 60 seconds about their pain .
And here are two patients . These are their records .
And you &apos;ll be asked : &quot; Who from both ? &quot;
And this is a very simple question .
The patient B had more suffered than ever before . His <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient A had cell phone B , and more .
But now there &apos;s another question : &quot; How much were these patients ? &quot;
And here &apos;s a surprise .
And the surprising thing is that the patient A has a much worse <unk> to the <unk> as the patient .
The stories of <unk> were different , and because a very different part of history is how it ends .
And none of those stories are very sophisticated , or great -- but one of them is this -- but one of them is much worse than the other .
And the worse it was that the pain was in the end of the end , it &apos;s a terrible story .
How do we know that ?
Because we asked these people to ask their <unk> , and even a lot later : &quot; How awful was the entire thing ? &quot;
And she was much worse for A + B. for B .
Now , this is a relatively immediate conflict between the <unk> self and self .
In terms of the <unk> self , B had a worse time .
Now what you could do with the patient A , and we actually did experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s going to work , you could actually create the <unk> of the patient A , and it &apos;s going to shake it without shaking your bags too much .
That &apos;s going to lead the patient , but just a little less than ever before .
And if you &apos;ve done this for a few minutes , you have to do that the <unk> self from the patient A bad off of the patient , and you have a much better off of the patient &apos;s self , because now you have a better history of his experience , because now you have a better history of his experience .
What was a story ?
And that &apos;s true for the stories that we care , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
In fact , a story of <unk> is <unk> , meaningful moments and ends .
The ends are very , very , very important , and in this case , the end .
Now the <unk> self is alive continuously .
It &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> , one after the other .
And you wonder , what happens with these moments ?
And the answer is , you know , you &apos;ve lost forever .
I mean , most moments of our lives -- and I have the reason -- you know , the psychological present for about three seconds , which means that there are about 600 million of them . In a month , there are about 600,000 million . In a month , there are about 600,000 .
Most of them were completely ignored by the <unk> self .
And yet , you can see the impression that they should count what &apos;s going on during that moment of life .
It &apos;s the finite resource we use during this world .
And how we use them would seem to be important , but it &apos;s not the story that the <unk> self holds .
So , we have the <unk> self and the self , and they &apos;re quite different .
The biggest difference between them is to deal with time .
From the way of view , if you have a holiday , if you have a holiday and the second week as well as the first one , it &apos;s twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
That &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> self .
For the sake of the <unk> self , it &apos;s hardly better than the <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new memory .
You have the history of it .
And in this way , in this way , in fact , is the critical variable that a <unk> self is different of a <unk> self from a <unk> self .
Now the <unk> self does more than to remember and stories .
It &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who is , say , two different surgeons at two different surgeons , and decides to determine what it should choose , then it &apos;s the memory of the memory that &apos;s less bad , and this is the surgeon who is selected .
The <unk> self has no voice in this choice .
In fact , we don &apos;t choose between <unk> . We choose between memories of memories .
And even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future as experiences .
We think about our future memories of memories .
And in fact , you can look at this , you know , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self as a , like one , which doesn &apos;t need to take the <unk> self from the <unk> of the <unk> self .
Now , I have the impression that if we &apos;re going to do a lot of the case , this means , we &apos;re going to <unk> on vacation in the <unk> of the <unk> self .
And this is a little bit hard to justify , I think .
I mean , how do we <unk> our memories ?
That &apos;s one of the explanations , which is given to the <unk> self .
And when I think about this , I think I &apos;ve done a vacation that we &apos;ve done a few years ago a couple of years ago , which was the best holiday I had ever had , and I think it &apos;s very often in relation to how often I think about other <unk> .
And I &apos;ve probably given up my memories of this <unk> journey , I would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
Now , if I had open up the folder with 600 images I &apos;ve spent another hour .
Now , these are three weeks , and this is the only one and a half hours .
There seems to be a <unk> .
Now , I may be a little extreme , you know , how little <unk> I have on the memory of memory , but even if you &apos;re making more of them , there &apos;s a real question . Why are we saving memories so much weight in the <unk> ?
So , I want you to think about a thought experiment .
Imagine their next vacation , you know , you know , at the end of the <unk> all your images , and you &apos;ll get a <unk> drug , so you &apos;ll get a <unk> drug , so you don &apos;t remember .
Now , would you choose the same vacation ? And if you chose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species and you &apos;ve got to think about how you might decide and this is not obvious , because if you think in the sense of time , you might have an answer . And if you think in the sense of memory , you might get an answer .
Why we pick the <unk> that we chose is a problem which is with a choice between the two species of self .
Now , the two types of self are two words of happiness .
In fact , there are two concepts of happiness that we can use , a self .
So you can ask , how happy is the <unk> self ?
And then you &apos;d say , what &apos;s the moments of life in life ?
And they all are -- happiness , a rather complicated process .
What are the emotions that can be measured ?
And , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness from the <unk> self over time .
If you ask the happiness of the <unk> self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
That &apos;s not how happy one person lives .
It &apos;s about how satisfied or <unk> the person is when this person thinks about life .
Very different term .
Anyone who &apos;s not unlike these terms of happiness , and I belong to a lot of researchers about the well-being of happiness that I &apos;ve experienced in the study of the future of happiness in the back of happiness .
The distinction between happiness between happiness and happiness , and the <unk> self has been seen in the last few years , and now you &apos;re now going to try to measure the two <unk> .
The Gallup Organization has a global survey , where more than half people are asked questions about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other ways in the direction .
So in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of the self .
And the <unk> lesson that we have , I think , is that it &apos;s really different .
You can know how happy someone with life is , and this teaches them not much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
Just to give you a sense of the correlation that is about relation to the correlation that is about <unk> .
What does that mean if you meet someone , and you &apos;d say , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about your size ?
Now you &apos;d know something about your size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
They have so much uncertainty .
If I tell you that someone &apos;s life is like eight to 10 times , you have a lot of uncertainty over how happy it is to be with his <unk> self .
So that correlation is very low .
We know something about what &apos;s the happiness of happiness .
We know that money is very important , goals are very important .
We know that happiness mainly is content to be satisfied with people who we like , time with people who we like .
There are other pleasures , but it &apos;s dominant .
So , if you want to aim , if you want to maximize the two species of self , you &apos;ll have very different things .
The conclusion from what I &apos;ve been saying here is that we really should not really think of happiness for well-being .
It &apos;s a completely different term .
Now , a very quick reason why we can &apos;t think of happiness over happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life , and if we actually live in life .
So , if you ask the simple question , how happy people in California are not going to be the right answer .
If you ask this question , you have to think that people have to be happier than you , say , in Ohio .
And what happens is if you think about life in California , think of the difference between California and other places , and that difference , in the climate .
Now , it turns out that climate doesn &apos;t really be very important for the self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self which is why happy people are .
Now , because the self is responsible , you can go to the end -- some people might be able to go to California .
And it &apos;s kind of interesting to see what happens to people who move to California in the hope , happier .
Well , your self is not going to be happier .
We know this .
But one thing will happen , and you &apos;ll think that they are happier , because when they &apos;re thinking about how awful the weather in Ohio was in Ohio , and they feel that they made the right decision .
It &apos;s very difficult to think of well-being , and I hope , I &apos;ll give you a sense of how hard it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you .
Now , if we talked to a few weeks ago , you told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came from this Gallup survey .
Is that something what you can do , because you have a few minutes left ?
Daniel <unk> : Sure .
I think the most interesting outcome that we &apos;ve found in the Gallup survey is a number we have absolutely not expected .
We found that in terms of the happiness of the inevitable self .
When we looked at how emotion happens to vary .
And it turns out that under the income of 60,000 dollars per year , it &apos;s a very large sample of Americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a huge representative sample of 600,000 dollars in a year of 600,000 dollars in a year of 600,000 dollars a year .
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars per year are people unhappy , and they become increasingly <unk> , you become poorer .
That &apos;s what we get on an entirely flat line .
I &apos;ve never seen so flat lines .
What &apos;s going on , obviously , is that money doesn &apos;t take a <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s that lack of money , you know , a living misery of life , and we can measure this misery .
In terms of the other self , the self , you get another story .
The more money you make , the more money you have .
That &apos;s not true for emotions .
CA : But Danny , in the entire American pursuit of life , it &apos;s about life , liberty , ambition .
If people take these <unk> seriously , I mean , it seems to be all over the head , everything we think , for example , for example , for example .
Is there a chance that politicians , you know , that country in general would take a <unk> like seriously and based on based on politics ?
DK : You know , I think there are recognition for the role of <unk> in politics .
The recognition is going to be slow in the United States , not a question , but in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s going to happen right now .
People are to recognize that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
It &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to go to explore , or whether they want to go to explore , so we have to go to this discussion fairly soon .
As you can increase happiness , very different depending on how you might think and whether you might think of the <unk> self ,
That &apos;s going to influence politics , I think , in the coming years .
In the United States , in the United States , you have to measure the <unk> of the population .
That &apos;s going to be in the next decade of the national statistics .
CA : Now , it seems like this subject is going to be , or should be the most interesting political debate over the pursuit of the next few years .
Thank you very much .
Thank you , Danny <unk> .
Today I &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
And this may be surprised because my <unk> at the Foundation are mainly about vaccines and seeds to make the things that we &apos;re inventing and deliver the poorest two billion lives .
But energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years are not going to grow , and it &apos;s going to rain to a lot of it , how it can &apos;t be how it can &apos;t withstand the environment .
That leads to <unk> . It leads to <unk> . It leads to <unk> .
So , it will become a climate change for them .
Plus , it &apos;s very important for them .
In fact , if you could reduce the price of one thing to be able to reduce the price of energy by the most effective .
Now , the <unk> is over time .
In fact , it &apos;s based on <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> was the Industrial Revolution , and in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in <unk> case , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , <unk> , we can make modern materials , and so so many things .
So we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with power in the rich world .
But if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s reduce the price -- let &apos;s hit a new barrier , and it &apos;s linked to CO2 .
CO2 warms up the planet , and the equation for CO2 is pretty clear .
They <unk> the CO2 that leads to <unk> and <unk> these <unk> effects -- and that &apos;s the same thing on the weather , and perhaps worse , the natural ecosystems that don &apos;t adapt to these natural ecosystems , and all these systems can <unk> systems .
Now , the exact same relationship between a <unk> system , and it &apos;s going to <unk> <unk> , and where their implications are , there are some <unk> , but not quite a lot .
And there &apos;s some <unk> of how bad these implications are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
So I asked the <unk> : &quot; Do we really go down to zero ? &quot;
It &apos;s not half a or a quarter ? &quot;
The answer is : Until we get near zero , it &apos;s going to increase the temperature .
So it &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s very different from saying , we &apos;ve got a big <unk> truck that it has to be under a meter , and it can sort of put it in your <unk> .
This is all over the bottom , right ?
Now , every year , every year , every year , every year after 26 billion tons .
Every one of Americans is about 20 tons -- people from poor countries , less than one .
On average , it &apos;s about five tons of every one on the planet .
And somehow we &apos;ve got to create changes that can go to zero .
It &apos;s gone up increasing .
But different economic changes have changed the effect , and we have to go from dying of <unk> to reduction , and to a reduction in zero reduction .
This equation has four factors -- a little <unk> . You &apos;ve got this thing on the left -- and it &apos;s going to depend on the number of people , and it &apos;s going to depend on the number of people who are on average , the average energy every type of energy , the average energy for every type of energy , and the CO2 that &apos;s going to be a <unk> <unk> .
So , let &apos;s look at each of a factor , and think how to get it at zero .
In fact , one of those numbers needs very close to zero .
Now this is very good algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
First of all , we have the population .
Today , <unk> billion people today .
And it &apos;s nine billion <unk> coming up to nine billion .
In fact , if you have very successfully done with new vaccines , we could be able to go to 10 percent and be able to lower 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we can take a slope from 1.3 .
The second factor is the services we use .
That &apos;s all the food that we eat , clothing , TV , heating .
These are very good things and <unk> to make these services accessible to almost everybody on the planet .
It &apos;s great that it &apos;s going to go up .
In the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to use <unk> and less use , but on average , this number every year , every year , are going to be able to double the size of services .
Here we can see a very basic service . Is it going to be able to read your homework ?
And those students don &apos;t have it , so they go to their <unk> <unk> under the <unk> .
Now , in the <unk> , the E , the energy per service , is good news .
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of various successes in the <unk> , through other parts of <unk> , through new methods , there are lots of services where you can dramatically reduce <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
Some services can reduce 90 percent .
In other products , as the manufacturing process , <unk> <unk> : <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
In fact , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we can get a reduction in the reduced , maybe a factor of six , maybe even a factor sixth .
But in the first three things , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to 13 billion tons of <unk> 13 billion tons , and it &apos;s not enough .
So , let &apos;s look at the fourth factor , and this is going to be a <unk> -- this is the amount of CO2 that per <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the question of if you can get it to zero .
If you burn charcoal : No .
If you burn natural natural : No .
In fact , almost every calorie of electricity today , today , is CO2 , except renewables , and <unk> .
So what we need to do on a global scale is to create a new system .
We need <unk> .
Now , if I use this term , I don &apos;t mean the impossible .
The <unk> is a miracle . The PC is a miracle .
The Internet and its services is a miracle .
People have contributed to the development of this miracle .
Normally , there &apos;s no <unk> that you need a miracle until a certain date .
Normally it &apos;s just a little bit wrong , and some of them are not coming .
But in this case , we have to put <unk> in a very short amount of time .
Now , I asked myself , how can I <unk> ?
Do you have a natural <unk> , a demonstration , what &apos;s the idea of human imagination ?
So I remembered that I was in the last year , when I was <unk> , I liked it .
The idea was to be true , you know , there are people who live with mosquitoes .
So for energy , I noticed this .
So I decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be to be the <unk> of the environment here .
So here are some natural fireflies .
And it told me that they don &apos;t bite . In fact , they won &apos;t go to the glass .
Well , there are all kinds of ways , like these , but they don &apos;t all get much .
We need solutions to you , either , or many of us have to have a set of scaling up and so on , and even though there are lots of directions that I look for , I can really see five to which big demands .
I have <unk> , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
This may be the best part of it , and when it &apos;s better than I expect , it would be great , but my <unk> here is that we all have to have all these five work , and we can &apos;t give them to them , because all of these have <unk> problems .
Let &apos;s take a look at burning fossil fuels , burning of coal or gas .
What you have to do , it may seem simple , but it &apos;s not . You should all have the CO2 that comes from burning the <unk> , and it &apos;s going to catch up under pressure and then hoping that it stays there .
There are some <unk> that that &apos;s going to be at a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to get 100 percent going to be very difficult , and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> <unk> for the CO2 , is a big challenge . But the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
Who will make it ?
Who can guarantee what &apos;s literally a billion times bigger than any sort of waste that you can ever consider and other things ?
That &apos;s a ton of volume .
So this is a tough one .
Next : <unk> .
It also has three big problems . The cost , especially in <unk> countries , is high . The question is that you really feel that there &apos;s no way to go anywhere , despite human cooperation , that the fuel chain not to use for weapons .
What do you use with the garbage ?
Because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern .
People have to feel good , <unk> : 10 : 20,000 : 10 : 25,000 : 10 : 25,000 -- are three very difficult problems that might be solvable ?
So three very difficult problems that might be solvable , and that &apos;s why you should work .
The last three of the Vijf , I zusammengefasst .
These are the <unk> of energies as they often call it .
And it also -- even though it &apos;s great , it doesn &apos;t need any fuel -- they have some downsides .
One is the <unk> that these technologies are creating dramatically smaller than the <unk> .
These are <unk> , you talk a lot of <unk> times , a thousand times more than a regular power plant .
In addition to these vents at <unk> .
The sun doesn &apos;t seem like the whole day , it doesn &apos;t sound every single day , and it doesn &apos;t all touch the wind everywhere .
So , you have to have , if you depend on these vents , you have a way to get the energy back in time when you &apos;re not available .
So there &apos;s some <unk> . There are challenges in the transmission , and if we say , that &apos;s the source of energy outside of the country , don &apos;t just take the technology , you have to have to deal with the risk of where different people have , you know ?
And there &apos;s this <unk> .
And to show this dimension , I &apos;ve got all sorts of batteries which are produced : that for cars , computers , cell phones , <unk> , all sorts of electronic energy technologies , which uses the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , I found that all the batteries we &apos;re producing are less than 10 minutes of <unk> .
So what we need is a big breakthrough , something that is going to be 100 better than the approaches to time .
That &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
That &apos;s what happens when you try to say these hydrothermal vents are about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to support 100 percent on it , you need an incredible <unk> .
Now where to go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
A \&apos; <unk> project ? &quot; How are we going to go ?
What we need is lots of companies that work . Hundreds .
In each of these five parts , we need 100 people .
In many , you &apos;ll say : &quot; That &apos;s crazy ! That &apos;s good . &quot;
I think there are many , many people in this group are already engaged .
Bill <unk> has several companies , including one named <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in dozens of companies that make great things interesting and interesting opportunities , and I &apos;m trying to support it .
Nathan Myhrvold Myhrvold : Well , I &apos;m funding a firm , perhaps surprising to the nuclear approach .
There are some innovations in <unk> , modular , liquid .
In this industry , in this industry , a few years ago , it &apos;s not very surprising to the fact that some good concepts were <unk> .
The <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , it means one percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent , to burn it .
That &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
But in fact , you &apos;ve spent a long time thinking , but you could never simulate it properly if it worked , but since there &apos;s a modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you can see it , yes .
And because you burn these 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
In fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s reactors .
Instead of breaking up the head , just burn it .
That &apos;s the uranium of <unk> , a little bit like a candle .
You see , it &apos;s a sort of a column , a lot of times as <unk> waves .
That &apos;s actually the <unk> .
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky .
That &apos;s the waste that &apos;s the 99 percent . You have the part of it called <unk> uranium .
The <unk> for hundreds of years .
And when you put <unk> inexpensive and <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the lifetime of the planet .
You know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of ideas , which we need to come up with .
Think of how to measure success .
What should we look like ?
Now , we go to the goal that we have to reach , and then we talk about the <unk> .
A lot of talk about 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
It &apos;s really very important that we get there .
The rest of the 20 percent are produced in the poor countries , and still a lot of agriculture , and I hope it &apos;s going to be clean and cement .
So , in order to reach these 80 percent , they have to have to have developed countries , including countries like China , their <unk> <unk> .
The other note , whether it &apos;s going to apply the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
That &apos;s very important .
That &apos;s going to be a <unk> of this <unk> .
If we go back there , what should this look like ?
It should take back the two elements .
We need to use the <unk> to take a reduction in the way , and the less we <unk> , the less we can use , and it &apos;s the temperature .
But in fact , this note for the things that we &apos;re doing to the things that don &apos;t really lead to the large <unk> , just equally , or even slightly less important , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
These breakthroughs that we need to go to <unk> , and we can measure it , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
There are lots of great big news to this issue .
This is the Al Gore : &quot; We have a choice . &quot; David <unk> &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air &quot; .
They actually go through it , and they can create a framework where this can be very broad , because we need to support all of these sites .
There are some things that have to come together .
That &apos;s a wish .
A very frustrating desire , that we can invent this technology .
If you just take a wish for the next 50 years , I could pick the president , I could pick a vaccine , and I love it , or I could choose this wish , <unk> <unk> without CO2 , and I would take this request .
This is the biggest impact .
In fact , if we don &apos;t get this wish , it &apos;s going to be terrible between the long term , and in short , <unk> people are terrible people , between the United States and China , between the poor and <unk> <unk> and almost every life of these two billion .
So what do we need to do ?
Who measures I <unk> ?
We need to use more <unk> .
In places like countries like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about CO2 .
You know , you should talk to these <unk> <unk> , and you would be shocked by the <unk> of these innovativen approaches .
We need <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> something that creates a solar cell .
We have to spread the message .
We need to lead to dialogue and <unk> , and it &apos;s the stuff that &apos;s done by government .
It &apos;s a big wish , but I think we can go to it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you very much . Just to understand something better -- <unk> , can you give us an idea of the order of magnitude of this investment ?
Bill Gates : In order to take the simulation on a supercomputer , all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , is just a few million dollars , and even if we tested our materials in a Russian reactor , it &apos;s just to make sure it worked in the <unk> million .
The difficult step is to build the first <unk> , to find additional billions to the <unk> and the place that &apos;s actually building the first one .
As soon as the first one is , if it &apos;s going to promise , it &apos;s all clear , because the <unk> , the <unk> , is so different than when we know it .
CA : To understand that , in fact , this is going to be able to grow deep into the soil , just like a vertical nuclear fusion reactor , this <unk> <unk> , and then it starts going down , etc .
BG : Exactly . You &apos;ve got to go back to this reactor , so there &apos;s lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong and lots of controls could go wrong . That &apos;s not good .
But if you have very cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years -- think of a column -- think of a column --
And it &apos;s sitting there , and it &apos;s done for 60 years , and it &apos;s done .
CA : A <unk> thing , which is a solution to the garbage .
BG : Yes . Now what &apos;s going on with the garbage : You can sit it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it into the next reactor , and it &apos;s going to burn it into the next reactor and burn it .
And it &apos;s starting to take off the garbage , which is already already there , who &apos;s already exists in these <unk> or <unk> , and this is our <unk> .
So what &apos;s a problem for these reactors , which is what we put in , and it &apos;s going to be dramatically reduced to this process .
CA : But as you &apos;ve spoken to different people in this world , you &apos;ve spoken about these things .
Where is it the greatest interest in what &apos;s really important ?
BG : Now , we don &apos;t set up a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> for everything , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting interest in the name , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting people in Russia , India , India , China , China -- I was here , and I was talking to the <unk> , and I talked to the <unk> .
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and the Japanese put something in the direction .
This is a version of one thing that was made .
That &apos;s a more important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries that built this , so everybody who has done a rapid reactor , a <unk> for our first .
CA : In your mind , what &apos;s more likely to call a <unk> ?
BG : So now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to invent , and then 20 years .
That &apos;s sort of the <unk> that we have to show the <unk> that we have to <unk> .
And , you know , you know , <unk> , if all right , and this is a big wish , it could keep it easy .
And fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds and hundreds , and we need hundreds of ways to work with their pilot pilots .
And it would be best if it could happen , because then you can use a mixture .
In fact , we need a solution .
CA : <unk> the major breakthrough breakthroughs , this is the most beautiful ?
BG : A <unk> is the <unk> .
That would have been without the <unk> , but it &apos;s so much more important .
In nuclear , there &apos;s other cutting-edge firms .
You know , we don &apos;t know the work of work like this , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is another approach .
There &apos;s a bit of a <unk> <unk> which may seem hard , but maybe that &apos;s what it tells us .
And so it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s the beautiful thing that a million times a million times as well as one , say , a <unk> , and therefore , if you can handle the problems , and it &apos;s mostly the radiation , and it &apos;s the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in your own <unk> .
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work ?
Do we have to <unk> <unk> ?
BG : If you go into this situation , it &apos;s like you have too much food , and just before you have a heart attack . What do you need ? You might need a <unk> or something .
There &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> , which deals with various different techniques to <unk> the warming , so for 20 or 30 years , for us to deliver <unk> .
That &apos;s just a <unk> .
You hope that we don &apos;t need it .
Some people say , you don &apos;t really need to work on the insurance because you may not want to eat it , because you know , you know , you can save the <unk> .
Now , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart , if you look at the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a conversation in <unk> , if you have to go to it , if you should have this thing coming back faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
CA : <unk> : Do you have a few sentences to convince you to convince you ?
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics are living in very different camps .
Those who are scientific arguments are very little .
Do they tell you that there are negative effects going to have to do with the clouds ?
There are very , very , very few things that can tell you that there &apos;s a chance to have a million .
The <unk> here is something like AIDS .
You &apos;re making a mistake now , and you pay it a lot more later .
And so this idea , now , if you have all sorts of <unk> problems to invest in a few minutes -- and that &apos;s why this is not so clear , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , the IPCC Report , and there are people in the rich world , and there are people in the rich world looking at what &apos;s going to look like in the world .
The fact is that that uncertainty should be concerned .
But my dream here is that if you can do economic growth , and at the same time , the skeptics said , &quot; Okay , I don &apos;t care that it &apos;s not the CO2 , I wish I &apos;d almost like it , but I &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
CA : And this is your response to the <unk> argument , that if you use all this time and energy to solve the problem , all the other goals including malaria , and so on , it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources , and so on , it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to put money in , and so on , there &apos;s a stupid waste of resources that we can do .
BG : Well , the actual spending for the research -- think that the United States should spend 10 billion a year going on than they today -- this is not so dramatically .
It doesn &apos;t have any other things .
You can go to big <unk> , and here can be reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economically , and it &apos;s trying to fund it , and this is not the waste .
It &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short before the <unk> , and funded by the <unk> , and I think we need more things to be able to try to be much less expensive .
If the <unk> you can get it , a very high <unk> , you can just keep the <unk> .
I mean , everybody of us could spend five times the amount of money on our energy future without changing its lifestyle .
In the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
And even <unk> thinking .
Now , his new <unk> is now , &quot; Why is it not ? &quot;
He &apos;s going to be , because of the earlier stories associated with the <unk> , but he understood that it &apos;s a very , very lonely group , and so it &apos;s why it &apos;s going to take the <unk> .
And this is a <unk> I think it &apos;s appropriate .
The research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it is to be supported .
CA : Bill , I think I &apos;m talking about almost all the people here , when I say , I really hope that your wish is true . Thank you very much .
BG : Thank you .
Now , I &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what was a few months ago when I was thinking about a number of months ago for Italian Wired .
I kept on writing my <unk> <unk> , but I was in the process of writing the <unk> of the <unk> , and I noticed that I &apos;ve never seen in my life in my life , what the word &quot; disabled . &quot;
Let me tell you the post .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
I was able to read this list like reading a friend , and I had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but I couldn &apos;t tell you anymore , and I had to stop reading , and I had to stop reading and <unk> <unk> and <unk> emotional shock .
Of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . So I just thought that the copy must be pretty old .
But in fact , there was a copy of early &apos; 80s , when I was in the early 1980s , when I first started building my <unk> building outside of my building environment , and I was also able to relate to the other kids and to the rest of the world around me .
And thank God , I didn &apos;t use <unk> .
Now , if I take this thing seriously , I was born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose lives are positive , and today I &apos;m going to give you a chance of the opportunity and adventure .
So , I immediately said to you the <unk> of 2009 in 2009 , and I would expect to say I &apos;m going to put a <unk> piece .
Here &apos;s the <unk> version of this .
It &apos;s not much better .
In particular , I <unk> the last two words under &quot; Near <unk> &quot; .
But it &apos;s not just about the words .
It &apos;s about what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
It &apos;s about the values , in these words , and how to build those values .
Our language of our own thinking , and how we can see the world and people around us .
Many more transformative societies , including the Greek and <unk> , really believed that the <unk> of a <unk> has a big power , because what you can actually think of as <unk> , you can also <unk> .
So , what do we want to say -- a <unk> person , or a <unk> person ?
In fact alone , if you had a child to say , well , you could go to a child , and it &apos;s going to be able to pass it on ,
Wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open your doors ?
A human being , it was open to me , my pediatrician was at the <unk> Institute in <unk> <unk> .
He &apos;s called Dr. <unk> . A <unk> whose name , like you can think of most Americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly . So he was always Dr. P.
And Dr. P.
I found the time that I spent in this hospital , just a wonderful thing -- until my <unk> .
In fact , I had to repeat once a lot of times with this thick , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- in different colors -- you know , to build my <unk> , and I hated those tapes , and I hated them . I hated them . I hated them .
And imagine , I even have a <unk> child with Dr. P. <unk> , and so on trying to stop these exercises without success .
And one day , he looked into one of my exercises -- these were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a big , <unk> and young girl , you &apos;ll become one day .
And when you put it on , I &apos;ll give you 100 dollars . &quot;
This was , of course , a simple trick of Dr. <unk> , so I &apos;m doing the exercises that I don &apos;t want to do with , with the prospect of the cellular girl in the second floor , but it actually led me to see my daily <unk> <unk> with new eyes . So it came up with new and <unk> experience .
And I wonder how much his vision of myself as a strong , and <unk> young girl had shaped my <unk> , and I could so bear with myself as a natural , <unk> and <unk> person .
This is just one example of many , many , as adults can boost the imagination of a child .
But like the <unk> examples of evidence of evidence , don &apos;t take our language , let &apos;s take our language to imagine what we all wish all to do : every individual , to allow anyone to see , to see themselves as <unk> people .
Our language was followed by the social changes that were triggered by a technological change in many cases .
Of course , from the medical point of view , you can say , well , my legs , the <unk> , <unk> from titanium and artificial <unk> for <unk> bodies to use it to use all their ways to use and to develop the boundaries of their destiny , not to <unk> platforms , connecting to social media networks to form , and to create a sense of how to define their own identity , their own identity .
And that &apos;s how to <unk> around the world to pick it up .
So , perhaps , because of this technological change , because you &apos;ve always had a different truth , because every person of the society of society can be something very different , and that the human ability to adapt to , and the human ability to adapt , is to adapt , and that &apos;s the human capacity .
The human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story because people always ask me to tell me how to <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you something : this phrase for me , and I felt very uncomfortable with the questions of people to answer , and I think , why .
This phrase , of course , lives of <unk> with the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge without being a <unk> experience , and so if my life would go to a <unk> experience , because I could avoid the possibility of a life with a prosthetic knee , or whatever people can <unk> with me .
But the truth is that we change , of course , of course , of the challenge , of course , whether it &apos;s physically , emotionally , or even both of them .
And I &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good .
<unk> are not an obstacle that we need to <unk> with our lives to make our lives better .
<unk> are just some of our lives .
And I tend to think of <unk> as my shadow .
Sometimes I realize it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s not too easy , but it &apos;s constantly at me .
And I don &apos;t want to have the impact on the impact of the <unk> of a human being .
There are <unk> and challenges , and these are just <unk> , and everybody else is going to be different , but the question is , it &apos;s not whether we &apos;re going to come to <unk> or not , but what is it ?
So , we are not just responsible for the people we love to preserve <unk> , but it &apos;s also ready to go to it all right .
And we don &apos;t really appreciate our children , if we give them the sense that they can &apos;t adapt .
You &apos;ve got to separate two things : to be able to be the medical issue , and to be an <unk> , and to the other extent to believe whether I &apos;m <unk> or not .
And to be honest , the only true and permanent disabled thing that I had to be able to take apart , is that the world always says , it can describe me with this definition .
In our wish , to protect people who are in the hearts , and to tell them the cold truth about their medical forecast , or even having a forecast to the quality of life that they expect , we have to pay attention to the fact that someone actually is <unk> .
Perhaps the <unk> concept , which is just what &apos;s wrong in a broken way , and how to fix it , for every single larger disability than the <unk> .
If we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all of its forces and possibilities , and we honor it , in addition to the natural battle that they might have to lead , you might have to lead another disease .
We <unk> a people who have a value for our society .
So , we have to look beyond the <unk> and focus on all the aspects of human possibilities .
But on the <unk> , it &apos;s between perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , there &apos;s a connection .
We don &apos;t need these <unk> times , or <unk> , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid it , not to try to avoid it , but it &apos;s going to be able to go to the back of the carpet .
It may seem to be more clear , that we don &apos;t necessarily have to be able to overcome <unk> , but it &apos;s going to be open , and it &apos;s going to take it to <unk> , and maybe even dance .
And maybe , we can build it , as a natural , <unk> , <unk> and useful , and feel so about the presence of the presence of their presence .
In this year , we celebrate the 200 . This year of Charles Darwin , and when he wrote about the evolution of 150 years ago , Darwin was in my view , in my view , in the human character .
I would like it so : not the most of the way of the way of surviving his species , and it &apos;s not the <unk> of its species , but it can change the way to adapt .
<unk> processes creativity .
Not only from Darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of humans to survive , and <unk> , of the battle of the human mind , is determined by transforming conflict through conflict .
So again , change and customization are the greatest skill of people .
And perhaps , we first know what wood is , when we really get it to be tested .
Perhaps it &apos;s the sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own power .
We can give ourselves to ourselves .
We can give up a new significance to the more difficult times .
Maybe we can see <unk> as a transformation .
<unk> for a change we haven &apos;t adapted yet .
I believe that the worst damage that we have is to believe is that we should be normal .
Honestly -- who &apos;s normal ?
There &apos;s no normal .
There &apos;s the <unk> . The <unk> . But not the conventional , and would you really want to know the poor , and would you really want to know that ?
I don &apos;t think more .
It would be great if it &apos;s the paradigm of normality versus another of the possibilities , and it could be a bit more dangerous , so we can release the forces of a lot of kids , and they invite them to bring their own and valuable skills to society .
<unk> found that we &apos;ve always had people from the members of our society and to be able to pay attention to , and to make a contribution .
There are hints of the Neanderthals around the back of the Neanderthals around the same people and people with severe physical injuries , and it might be something that happened because the <unk> of those individuals was valuable to society .
They didn &apos;t look at these people as broken and useless ; they were treated like something like that and <unk> .
A few years ago , I went to a city where I was growing up , in a <unk> center where I grew up in the Red Zone of Pennsylvania , and I was standing there on a <unk> tomatoes .
It was summer , and I had <unk> .
And I &apos;m listening to you , like a guy behind me , says , &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not the Aimee <unk> . &quot;
And I was <unk> around and seeing this old man . I had no idea who it was .
And I said , &quot; Excuse me , sir , we know ? I can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , you know , you don &apos;t know .
When I first saw this , I got you out of your mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
Oh , so .
And , of course , it &apos;s going to have a click of it .
This was Dr. <unk> , a guy that I knew from the stories of my mother , because I knew , of course , my birthday was two weeks late late birthday .
The doctor for four years of my mother was on vacation , and so my parents , and so my parents , in the world , didn &apos;t .
And because I was born without <unk> and my feet , and I had just a few toes on this and some toes on the other voet , he had to have the <unk> message to the bad news .
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell you your parents that you never walking , and never would be the same as other children , or that you could never take an independent life , and then you &apos;ve ever had me in trouble . &quot;
But what &apos;s extraordinary was that he was collecting <unk> of my entire childhood , whether I had won a <unk> in the second grade , whether I was to Halloween , whether I was using my scholarship or an <unk> <unk> , and he used these clips to teach his students , <unk> Medical School and <unk> Medical School .
And he called this <unk> <unk> the X , the potential of the human race .
You can &apos;t just simply say how critical of this factor of quality of a human life can be .
And Dr. <unk> said , he said , he said , &quot; I &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t get any other time , and even if they get a little bit of support , when you get children , they can really achieve a lot . &quot;
Look , Dr. <unk> has changed .
He understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone has to deal with , two different things .
And also , I &apos;ve changed my thinking in time when she asked me about 15 years old , whether I had my prostheses to have my prostheses to come up with arms and bone , then I had no second <unk> .
I was dying , and I was normal .
If you ask me this today , I &apos;m not sure .
And that &apos;s happening , and I &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and I don &apos;t have to <unk> these experiences .
And maybe that &apos;s because of course , this transformation , because I &apos;m faced with so many people who open doors to me , instead of facing people who missed me , I want to <unk> a picture .
See , there &apos;s just a human being able to demonstrate how you can <unk> your powers , and you &apos;re through .
If you allow someone to take your own , your own inner forces -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and you can open a open source of a moment , then you &apos;re a very good teacher .
They bring them to open doors .
The meaning of the <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
It means that , in one , in one , it &apos;s the potential of <unk> .
Again , what is the opportunity ?
In the 1960s , in the 1960s , in the U.K . , in the United Kingdom , <unk> was <unk> in <unk> .
They call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the United States in the United States .
The students are divided into grades .
And the student became more sophisticated getting paid attention to the better teachers .
They &apos;ve spent over time talking about a <unk> <unk> with a &quot; <unk> &quot; note . They were given to them , and they were told to be very clever . And after that three months , they wrote it .
And of course , it <unk> it to the heart of the fact that the <unk> was told , they were just good enough .
And that &apos;s the same after the three months .
But the only ones that still still in school -- except for the students who had <unk> school .
Quite important in this trial was that the teachers were not supposed to be <unk> .
The teachers didn &apos;t know that it was changed .
They were just told to be the <unk> , and that &apos;s the students with the note -- and they &apos;ve been taught them to teach them and they treated them .
The only true disabled of mind is a mind , a mind which was broken , has no hope anymore . He doesn &apos;t find any more sentimental , <unk> <unk> and our inherent capacity of imagination .
But if we can do it , if we can create the human spirit , keep the hope , and other people around the world to be beautiful , and then <unk> our powers really , really good .
When a mind does have a mind , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
Now , I want to end with a poem that was written by a <unk> poet called <unk> in the 14th century and telling my friend telling you four words . &quot; Every child knows God , not the god of the name , but the God who knows about just four words , but he constantly does all four words . &quot;
Come with me . Thank you .
