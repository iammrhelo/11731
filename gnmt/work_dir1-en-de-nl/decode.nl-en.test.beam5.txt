A couple of examples here is Peter <unk> here here at TED , at TED .
The <unk> .
And the idea is , in fact , , in four words , four , so you can put a so large number of <unk> with 20 and a lot , a <unk> , a <unk> and a Marshmallow .
The Marshmallow is down .
And , as it seems simple , it &apos;s really quite schwierig , because this is really quite exciting , because this thing zwingt become very , sehr schnell .
And so I found that a very interesting notion , I found it in a very high school firm .
And it &apos;s a big Erfolg .
And then , in about 70 years , I was doing this campaign in the whole world , designers and designers and Architekten , and even with ideas from Fortune <unk> .
And all of these things , in fact , is , in fact , that people have been working together and I will share some of them with you .
Normalerweise , in fact , ist der erste Schritt , das <unk> .
They &apos;re going to reden , and they &apos;re not going to look like that , they &apos;re <unk> .
Dan do they get planen .
They start using Spaghetti .
The most part of the time , they just kind of <unk> out of the Spaghetti <unk> .
And am Ende , as soon as it comes to , one thing to do was , they throw it on top of it , then , as soon as it comes out , a little <unk> and ... <unk> !
They make their work .
But he was really , really , the &quot; <unk> &quot; in a &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; the whole thing from the Marshmallow <unk> .
<unk> people , &quot; Oh , &quot; <unk> like others .
Was the most serious one to do with a MBA .
They &apos;re lying , they betrügen , they &apos;re abgelenkt , and they make pretty special <unk> .
And he did all the other with a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
And that &apos;s the best part of them , though , in fact , working out of graduate students .
This is an incredible thing .
And Peter tells us , they &apos;re not just the most beautiful <unk> .
So , do you think , well , how do you think ? Warum ? Why do you work ?
<unk> : &quot; No one of the kids , &quot; &quot; No one of the kids at the spaghetti sauce <unk> . &quot; Right ?
They don &apos;t have a time with <unk> .
But he &apos;s here .
And it turns out that <unk> <unk> to be able to do the same thing .
And then they do that .
But he was working when they do the Marshmallow and she &apos;s not an experience .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
Klingt vertraut ?
What do you do differently ...
She started working with the Marshmallow .
They &apos;re Prototypen and Prototypen and Neue Prototypen ...
<unk> with the Marshmallow , so they &apos;ll get some Gelegenheiten to make some bad Prototypen .
The <unk> is the way of working together as a <unk> track .
In all the way , the kids get involved in the children all the time , and it doesn &apos;t work .
So it was also a lot of Prototypen as well as a very , very relevant .
But , let &apos;s take a bunch of other Teams .
The average person for the most , is about 50 centimeters ...
<unk> the help , they would make sure they do , but not much better .
<unk> , more than the most Erwachsene .
How do you do the best ?
<unk> and <unk> , glücklich .
The most high mass that I &apos;m looking at , which I look at my foot .
And why ? Weil they <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> Strukturen all the way down , and <unk> <unk> .
CEOs , like , a typical average score .
But it was interesting : when you put a <unk> on the team , they &apos;re more comfortable .
<unk> . You see the Team and thinks , &quot; They get to win . &quot;
You can do that . And why ?
Because they &apos;re going to be in there .
They &apos;re managing , they know , they know .
And jedes Team , in fact , , in fact , is that , in fact , is the value of the work , the value of the team .
<unk> and <unk> Fertigkeiten suffers together .
So , as you do , when you do , at 10 , he wants to do this in the next 10 years .
And I had a interesting thing .
I thought , &quot; Well , it was more exciting .
So I &apos;m adding 10,000 dollars from software to the top .
And , do you think of this <unk> ?
Was here ?
That &apos;s the one .
No one Team took a <unk> .
A <unk> , like , one , one , one Zentimeter , whatever to win , to win .
Now , interestingly enough , a lot of the work that makes great work .
We have played all the games again .
And , do you think that ?
So , they know , they know , they know all the way to know .
And the fact that this made the most beautiful team in one of the world .
They did the most incredible <unk> in the same way .
So that &apos;s a pretty good lesson for us to treat the condition of Belohnungen and Erfolg .
So , you might want to ask yourself , &quot; Why do you think will be a way to do this ?
And the talk here is , I was working with digital tools and a tool for Teams in the past , <unk> and visuelle Effekte .
And the <unk> hilft ihnen , <unk> <unk> .
Because , fair , , every product would have done his own Marshmallow , right ?
Die Herausforderung ist eine gemeinsame Erfahrung , eine gemeinsame Sprache , eine <unk> Institution , die den besten Prototypen dienen .
And so this is the value of the sort of thing .
And for such a way as <unk> , he went out .
So , here , in that Blog , you can actually tell the phone books .
He &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
He &apos;s been interested in the world of the whole world and a bunch of people have gone on .
It is <unk> .
And the most popular lesson , I think , is that Design is actually a <unk> .
And it <unk> all the time all of our Sinne , and , in fact , the best way to do , is , and , the best way to do , is to be able to do this .
And , in a small way , a small Prototyp of all <unk> , is something called &quot; Oh , &quot; -Moment in a <unk> &quot; dream space .
And it makes a huge difference .
Danke .
So , let &apos;s take a sense of a Maschine , a big Machine , a &quot; cool &quot; Machine , and it was a Zeitmaschine .
And everyone here here is in there .
You can do that in the same way in the same way , but not here .
Now , I &apos;m more interested in this point , because I was able to do this all the time all the time , and it will all be <unk> .
They all want to be at the same time for the same time or <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know .
I überzeugt that he <unk> a little <unk> <unk> .
And I can get there .
But I don &apos;t seem to be here .
I will not go out , and I &apos;m not so <unk> to be so <unk> .
They don &apos;t have the same way that they get .
So , I will be in the Machine and I will be in the same way .
We live in the <unk> Zeitalter , in a way that man will be alive , but will be healthy , poor , <unk> , <unk> by Krankheiten .
It &apos;s not what it does .
My <unk> is all about 60 .
I found all these 70 percent .
And my Eltern are all about 80 .
So I like that , I like that , in the 90ern , I can make a sense in the 90 .
But it wasn &apos;t just one of us .
He &apos;s a lot more on the Spiel .
One Kind , that in Neu-Delhi has been born a Lebenserwartung equivalent to the top of the world .
Think about it . It is a very powerful fact .
And why ?
The Pocken . The Pocken that have Milliarden people on the planet of <unk> .
They would impact the impact of the world in the same way that one of them was the same .
They &apos;re not in fact . They &apos;re gone .
We get them down . <unk> !
In the reicheren <unk> gibt Krankheiten , which is <unk> for Millionen of people , so it makes more than less .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
Now , do you know here ?
<unk> , modern Medizin have been able to reach hundreds of thousands of devices , all of the ways you can do that .
And for me , the medical method used to be known about it , and see , and it wasn &apos;t until , one of the most surprising Errungenschaften in the world .
That &apos;s the good news .
But , don &apos;t know all , the only good news will be , because he may be a number of other issues , and one more of them , despite all all the time , he all had a Milliarde other people in the morning in the world .
<unk> of themselves , and it turns out that there is a Schande .
And so , not all , so , in fact , , we have to be able to use our Vorstellungskraft to verschmutzen that way .
<unk> Wasser , <unk> , <unk> , Öl , Gas : they &apos;re dead , and , as we can &apos;t be able to be able to hear about coral reefs , they have gone away .
So , the question is , is , can we think of it ?
I think that , in fact , that is , in fact , that is , in fact , that in the world , there are hundreds of thousands of people working on the ground without the way we live .
I think of course , in fact , the world of <unk> will be able to do not with them .
I know that real , and , no , no <unk> .
But here , I was able to lie at night -- one of the things at night I was wrong at night .
So no matter what people have been able to be able to do with an extraordinary Fortschritt , and not in fact , and in fact , we can &apos;t do that .
Now , in the meantime , the <unk> Fortschritt in all of the number of days .
And I think , in fact , that , in fact , I say , there &apos;s been 300 years out there , say , for the beginning , for the Zeitalter der Aufklärung , to have a sense of time , to be at the same time , that we have been working on her <unk> and <unk> .
Now , people would include their <unk> in terms of such <unk> , so that it &apos;s fast unmöglich .
And , you know , everybody is right on your own opinion ; everyone agrees with a very , very own , more exciting though , but you can &apos;t do it ?
You don &apos;t have a very , very special . No , it &apos;s not that .
And I was walking for him to make me work .
For a matter of course , I read a story about <unk> for The New Yorker for The New Yorker .
I think I would make a sense of <unk> , which was the most effective <unk> <unk> for the Gesundheitswesen in the cosmos .
I didn &apos;t know what was doing , so I would like to tell you a Geschichte , and I went out .
So , a little bit of <unk> , I schrieb a story about genetically engineered technology .
So that &apos;s the same thing , but it &apos;s still <unk> .
People become <unk> .
So I would like to tell you a story , and I would not know why , and I didn &apos;t know why people would say this &quot; <unk> &quot; , and why they thought they were working in a <unk> way , in a zufälliger way .
But , you know , I was doing , I was doing a story , and I was writing about the same story . I &apos;ve been working on the same thing , and I &apos;ve been working on the other day , and I think , &quot; We used to cook .
But all the time I would do , I mean , I would not like to make sure why , but finally .
And it turns out that the <unk> that makes me feel pretty much not <unk> .
They were <unk> , gutes beigebracht .
So , the people in diesem Raum .
And it makes me so <unk> ...
But then I thought , well , let &apos;s be fair to be fair : We &apos;re on the moment in the world , in a way , in the way , in the course of the year as a <unk> .
He &apos;s been <unk> .
And he &apos;s been going to be ironic to the same thing than he did .
&quot; Fortschritt . &quot;
OK , there are Gründe for me , and I think we know .
We have lost the Glaube in the arms , and in the Wissenschaften , and in the Wissenschaften , and in the Wissenschaften , and he can &apos;t talk .
You have a few of the things that have gone wrong and the people who know it .
<unk> , <unk> , the Challenger , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I mean , you know , you can actually set up the innovators .
He would have come and with the people who was telling us , they would be the same thing .
Be skeptical .
Think of the questions , ask beweisen and <unk> , don &apos;t always go .
But it turns out that , as you can get -- as you can get to them , then you can attack them .
And the talk that I was saying is that , in a dead course , I can be able to see <unk> <unk> Lebens , and in fact , that they can get away .
And so it started about 12 years ago , he announced that there was a relationship between the disease region and the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> .
Many of these studies will be done by what they do .
And so what it means is that , it would be very frightening .
The two ?
They &apos;re going to be in the United States , in England , in Canada , in Canada , and all the same results : not a relationship , not in them .
But it doesn &apos;t mean it , it doesn &apos;t do , because it was <unk> , because , remember , the reason we &apos;re seeing and was an interesting thing to do and think , was that , the way we &apos;re thinking .
So , here &apos;s not an example of an <unk> of <unk> <unk> , who would give us an awful lot of advice , and I can do that .
You know ?
The other thing were katastrophalen , Katastrophe , and that was the fact that the United States is one of the most important land in the world , in the most part in the world , the number of <unk> .
So it &apos;s <unk> , and we have to be schämen .
It &apos;s a beautiful thing .
So , what did he do with us , with her ?
Now , verstehe it . I &apos;m sure .
So , how do you get here ?
Does anybody get to the show you can see some of the lights ?
Doesn &apos;t matter .
And here , all right here is not so much , but it occurred letztes Jahres .
There is one Menge <unk> , 20 people , 20 pro Stunde .
But here , here , here , here &apos;s not an accident , and people as a Jenny , and the people as Jenny <unk> out of Angst and <unk> in <unk> <unk> than the Oprah and Larry King live .
And they can do that , because they can &apos;t make a difference between <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
They don &apos;t know all the way that these things are not real .
And it was all , like , have Lernen .
And this one you look at , Jonas <unk> .
There was one of our most successful <unk> .
No <unk> , no <unk> .
You can do that in it .
It was called Paul <unk> .
It entwickelt to the <unk> , and it <unk> with some other people .
It rettete the Leben by 400,000 dead children in the dritten world .
Okay , so ?
Now , it &apos;s really good , except that Paul <unk> with <unk> of Impfstoffen and <unk> them .
And the people will fail to <unk> .
And so it says .
So , Paul acts .
Now , when it comes to a free word , then you can do that in <unk> .
You get to go into the other country , because he wants to offer them up to say , they know , they know , because they know the children are <unk> .
And why ? Weil Paul einen Impfstoff entwickelt hat .
I don &apos;t have to say that , but Impfstoffe are <unk> .
So , as you can go away and get out of the other , horrible Krankheiten , and that was the most part of course .
We have <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s been <unk> , in fact , in fact , in fact , that he wants to be able to go out of the future .
And they don &apos;t just want to be <unk> .
So , do anything with Polio ?
A <unk> <unk> schrieb me some of the pieces of paper and she told me , she found me a bit of <unk> .
No one never told me .
They didn &apos;t make anything <unk> about Polio .
No .
Okay .
Why ? Weil man kein Polio has .
And here &apos;s just not something that happened to me .
But , as you know , it might be a little bit at a factory in Lagos , and er is just a little <unk> , and er is just a picture of Ohio .
Within a few hours , then , <unk> at Long Beach , where it comes in Long Beach , where it comes from the fantastic TED Prize .
And it turns out that it &apos;s not something that happens to be a human disease , and it &apos;s not so clear that .
That planet is the planet . It doesn &apos;t happen .
We &apos;re just letting ourselves be just in Lügen .
Does anybody have an hour &apos;s time <unk> ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , a little bit of <unk> ?
I know , I know , the help is all the time .
They <unk> them , and they use alternative tools , and it doesn &apos;t have to be able to do so with them .
The data suggests it &apos;s <unk> .
They make a split up of its face . And practically no one .
OK , as you can get 28 Milliarden Dollar in front of some of the local parts , it was so .
<unk> Urin . <unk> .
Why do we do ? Why do we do ? I think I know , I know , I know , I hate Big Brother .
We hassen the Regierung . We <unk> the <unk> .
So , it will be <unk> .
They &apos;re all coming from <unk> .
They &apos;re fantastic <unk> and besorgniserregend for all of them , they would have to work .
So we have gone away from now , and where did he go ?
We <unk> in the poor by Big <unk> .
There is great . I was big placebo .
But , you know , this is really , because the whole world is horrible , and I offer millions of dollars .
So I &apos;m here to make some of the things .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , I don &apos;t know anything , but let alone hundreds of thousands of dollars .
And , do you know ? When I was going to tell you the people to sing , and they say , &quot; Was is the kind of her ? &quot;
They make him happen . &quot;
And , do you know ? She &apos;s a mistake .
Now , it &apos;s not about the public or the <unk> of the <unk> , which says , &quot; Well , I did not have been informed by my Experten of <unk> . &quot;
Some of the other <unk> <unk> will be treated with <unk> .
Now , when you start talking about <unk> and Wissenschaft , with the heart and the magic as soon as you can &apos;t do what you want .
And then you end up in the South Africa , <unk> <unk> .
It is verantwortlich für the Toten by 400,000 by the fact that <unk> , <unk> and <unk> effektiver were more conservative than the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in a country that will be different from the other age of <unk> .
Don &apos;t tell me , that all sorts of things have failed .
They don &apos;t have them . They have them .
Now , the most <unk> Epidemie in the process , in the most part , is the practical part of genetically integrated and <unk> <unk> .
It is an <unk> Streit . It &apos;s stopping .
It was <unk> , Metaphern .
It is Ideologie , keine Wissenschaft .
All , all of us , every <unk> Reis , every <unk> Reis , every <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , by the human race .
Now , in the course of the <unk> Paradies , he didn &apos;t have <unk> .
It wasn &apos;t <unk> .
No <unk> . They all of us .
So , in the course of the letzten 11,000 years , we started doing this .
Some of the Produkten of the Produkten things were missing .
We were <unk> at all , of course .
Now , in a way , we can do the same way in which <unk> way .
And , in fact , it &apos;s very , very <unk> .
But one of the thousands of times , he can make sure that in the future , he can save better lives .
So , here isn &apos;t this ?
I mean , I don &apos;t know .
We will not be genetically <unk> .
And why ?
Now , these are the whole time , too , to many Chemikalien , Pestizide , Hormone , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
We don &apos;t just love the other way the Patente to live on animals .
We don &apos;t want to have the social sciences in <unk> .
And , do you know ?
They &apos;re all right . Let &apos;s do him .
It was an incredible thing .
It &apos;s not <unk> .
Now , here is a good bet , Moral .
Science is not a <unk> .
No Country .
There is no idea ; it &apos;s a Prozess .
It &apos;s a Prozess , and it doesn &apos;t often matter .
But the Idee , in fact , is that , in fact , the real work is to do with her own job , because he &apos;s really <unk> , and he will be able to stop dead .
You know , in the end , in the end , in the end , we have to be dead at 70 percent of the time .
70 percent .
There is an attempt to do this in Africa for the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
They &apos;re really , really , and I &apos;ll never care .
And the talk ? <unk> are manipuliert .
We don &apos;t want to treat <unk> as a <unk> approach as <unk> .
<unk> is the equivalent of human beings , and it seems to be a sense of Kartoffeln .
It &apos;s only one of them , but <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t mean <unk> all over the products and the Wissenschaftlern are working on him .
So to make sure that there are no blind going to be blind .
They don &apos;t have more verhungern , and they know ?
It would be very , very <unk> . It won &apos;t be <unk> .
And all I was saying is that , why are we ?
I mean , let me ask you , why are we dying ?
Now , do you not need to be <unk> ?
So this is <unk> <unk> . <unk> has never met Chemikalien .
And so it wasn &apos;t with our lächerlichen hearts for Hormone , our demand for most of us , and our kids are working together .
It wasn &apos;t about Rice <unk> , and it &apos;s not to be comfortable with the other .
And it was more often , because , of course , that will say that .
Because , do you know ?
Now , when we do not work and weitermachen , we &apos;re guilty about something , which was not guilty , at High-Tech .
I don &apos;t mean to be able to speak of that .
It &apos;s <unk> and hässlich , our <unk> and <unk> , and he was working .
Now , after that <unk> <unk> , you might be saying , &quot; Hey , do you want to do this ? &quot;
Yeah . I &apos;m sure .
Now , in fact , they &apos;ll be in the Gegenwart , but , in fact , a small chance .
We all have the Time Machine for all of us , working .
So , here is an American safe to make us an American , and then , in fact , they will , where wir möchten .
We have gone through the course of the <unk> and <unk> , but when I go out , but when I was walking out and <unk> , we have been happy .
I know that , I know , I was able to do , and that was , for me , a lot of the world knows .
Danke .
Danke .
A <unk> from the Los Angeles Times ...
Steve <unk> war a time .
by the city of Los Angeles ...
as you can make an incredible story .
You get to one .
I believe .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> with a Geige on a Geige with two Strings .
I &apos;ve been talking about all of you know ...
Now , the <unk> view of Steve <unk> ...
I was born for a book .
Robert <unk> <unk> the action of Steve <unk> ...
And Jamie <unk> from <unk> Anthony <unk> ...
The Soviet <unk> <unk> ...
They wanted to be very , very brave work ...
Now , it turns out that it turns out to be paranoid of paranoid .
<unk> left out with the <unk> .
and 30 years later , there &apos;s obdachlos ...
by the ärmsten city of Los Angeles .
You know , you know , Steve &apos;s got to be lesen about the Film .
It wasn &apos;t just for the <unk> Band ...
I found that one of these two <unk> .
But , in fact , there was the other way to look at the other story ...
I mean , as I like that like that like that , like I like that .
I was able to get away from the ground .
I found <unk> in 2008 ...
<unk> , in <unk> .
There was a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> Symphonie from Beethoven ...
and backstage of backstage and <unk> .
There was a <unk> and a <unk> way .
From <unk> and Hillary Clinton .
<unk> told that , the Dodgers didn &apos;t make the World Series .
all of a sudden the rate of <unk> <unk> ...
The fourth part of the fourth Symphonie from Beethoven .
We were looking at the story .
I would like to tell you that <unk> would be a <unk> of me .
You know , you know , you know , <unk> will not be treated .
And if you look at what er called <unk> <unk> ...
<unk> and <unk> ...
And it makes it <unk> .
And it turns out that there is now ...
<unk> from Schizophrenie .
At the appropriate brain ...
<unk> er ...
and it &apos;s just <unk> .
It <unk> off the ground .
I live with the <unk> and the Unordnung in my agenda ...
which is the core of <unk> .
<unk> in a way in which <unk> is <unk> .
at the end of my class .
There was a <unk> cutting in its own eyes .
It &apos;s left .
It &apos;s been going on ...
<unk> Dämonen and Rauch ...
and one of them will be vergiften , vergiften themselves .
I had Angst .
I don &apos;t mean to me .
I mean , in fact , that I could escape ...
that er would be <unk> in such a way ...
I mean , and I would be born with the Geige ...
When I started walking ...
and <unk> and other exciting examples ...
by the time man lernt .
So I started doing things like that .
I actually spielte a first part of Beethoven Beethoven .
And if I played ... ...
I look at a very low journey .
in the eyes of <unk> .
It would like to be a <unk> brain .
I mean , a chemical judge for my play ...
The Katalysator .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> ...
I had come out .
In quiet Neugier and <unk> .
And when it comes to a Wunder , it would make my own Geige ...
and I started writing on the phone .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> ...
I &apos;d like to make it abgeschlossen . <unk> ...
<unk> , <unk> .
And now , we started taking over Musik .
in Beethoven and <unk> ...
<unk> , all right .
Van <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
I think there was no one .
<unk> a <unk> of a <unk> .
But there was one of the things that you make of the story .
And it would make a difference in the same way ...
I mean , the same way , as I and a lot of my own and ...
from Los Angeles .
I want to make an act of making fun of humor ...
The one half of my life war ...
I mean by the paranoid <unk> ...
which are right away from the city .
from Los Angeles ...
in a charming picture , <unk> ...
brilliante , I wonder , as I were amazed , more brilliant .
Music heilt .
For <unk> is a kind of game design .
You can make a sense of music ...
and <unk> <unk> ...
by his imagination and the Kreativität ...
in reality .
So <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are integrated .
I think , in fact , that , the best way of art .
And this is the reason that we make Musik .
And that was all the way that I was all alone ...
<unk> in our panic .
So , our minds .
And that , by the way , that , in the course of our künstlerische style ...
by the time , the emotional <unk> can form into reality .
The reality of the Ausdruck ...
I had all the time .
We become struck and <unk> .
<unk> ...
It comes from a bunch of photos .
The <unk> is taking place <unk> .
into a new sense of Musikern ...
I mean , that &apos;s the hell that he missed .
They all share the resources ...
and it &apos;s <unk> .
I &apos;ll just be able to do this with <unk> .
Now , in Walt Disney <unk> <unk> ...
<unk> from the ground .
I become free .
Danke .
Danke . Danke .
Robert <unk> .
I will make a little bit of <unk> about making <unk> .
<unk> me .
I Jane <unk> . I &apos;m a <unk> .
For me , I do have been for 10 years long .
And my goal for the least 10 years ago ist , in the past , the world in the real world , so that in Spielen .
Now , I have a Plan , and the Plan is , you know , all sorts of people , all sorts of people , all of the time , to make a lot more fun and better Spiele .
At this moment , at this moment , we have three Milliarden items in the world .
Now , some of them think , &quot; It makes a lot more sense to make Spiele . &quot;
It may be very , very much , as many of the great things in the real world have been working on .
Now , in fact , I think , in fact , , in my study , the Institute for the Institute for The <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
For me , three thousand dollars in the morning is not genug , for the rest of the world .
See , I &apos;m aware that , when I was able to live the same planet on that planet , that we can make the difference between the time .
I have been published , I have been able to do about 21 Mrd. lines in the same way .
And that &apos;s probably a curious Idee , so I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;ll be <unk> .
Now , when I was living through the experience , people , Klimawandel , Klimawandel , heart failure , as well as I know , I know , I know that , I know , I know , I know about the equivalent of the equivalent of five and more , better than that .
And these are the talks . There are all sorts of things that are really good for , why Spiele are so relevant to the experience of the human Überleben .
This is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You want to do the emotion of it .
So it turns out that there is a building for the models for you .
And this is a klassischen smile .
Now , when you don &apos;t have become a Spieler , you &apos;ll actually make a place in the picture .
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , a little bit of <unk> , so you can do intensive care , so you can do intensive care .
Now , when you &apos;re a Spieler , you &apos;ll notice here a few of the faces : the <unk> is all about the Augen and Mund .
<unk> down to a scene of Überraschung .
So this is one thing that is , at a point , something called &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; .
Ah , you know , OK , good .
So here , here , here , here , here , here , here .
A &quot; <unk> &quot; is a result that so erstaunlich positiv is , she can &apos;t figure out that , she can &apos;t figure it out .
And so it &apos;s pretty little <unk> .
And as you can do it , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s been <unk> . It will be a <unk> .
So this is a Spieler , on the moment , so , as you get to get to make sure .
And this is the Gesicht , that , in the next year , , in the whole of the world , the whole world in the past , and it was the way that we had the <unk> .
The head of someone that goes on all the time , at all , at all , is , at all , it will be <unk> .
But , in fact , let &apos;s make a look at the same thing in the täglichen world , and , in the same time , we &apos;re <unk> .
And here is , &quot; I Ben nicht so , &quot; I mean , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
And here is something that I do . Can you do it ? Yeah . OK .
I mean , here is &quot; I Ben not so , &quot; <unk> .
This is a little Graffiti in my little city at Berkeley , California , where I was doing my Promotion like that , because in the real world .
And this is a very , very , very little business .
So , here , the truth is that , in the same way , we &apos;re not in the same way in which we are in Spielen in Spielen .
And I don &apos;t really need to make sure , so , all the way that he did .
You can do things in Games . I mean , I mean , but I mean , I mean , that &apos;s really good enough to do with a lot of things , of course .
And as in a game , I can be the most part of the world , the most of us , the most part of ourselves , the most dramatic part of us to help .
The most dramatic part of that , as it &apos;s been working on for a little while , is the good thing to do with a taste .
And when we live in the real world , as we can do with addiction , as we can see with addiction , are not so much .
We can come down . So , we fühlen .
So , here , I feel Angst , maybe <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So , the people never have the ability to make Spiele .
They &apos;re not in Games .
So that &apos;s what I was like to do , if I was a building .
For example , where do you make a lot of sense that we can &apos;t do so if we can &apos;t do anything ?
So , do you mean the minds of Spiele doing the work in the real world ?
So this is watching Spiele as Word as Word or Warcraft , that really , really the ideal <unk> Umfeld , in the past .
And I started to notice some of the things that goes on the Internet , as I can do that in the online world .
And the first thing that I realize is that every time you can do the online world , most of the music World , most of the world , is very , very diverse Figuren in the past .
Now , don &apos;t <unk> to be a Mission , which is the ideal for your level , right ? Right ?
You can do it .
They &apos;re not allowed to help you out a story .
You know , it &apos;s on the core of your side ; it &apos;s really hard .
It &apos;s not Arbeitslosigkeit in World of Warcraft .
You can &apos;t do anything special .
He &apos;s a little bit at a very low level , and he was working .
And so it &apos;s very , very <unk> .
And every place where you can go out , it can make hunderte of them , they &apos;re helping to make their <unk> work .
So this is something that was really , really , really , really , very , very , very much more important .
And so he &apos;s all <unk> Geschichte , all of the sudden , inspirierende Geschichte , that tells us why here was here .
And so , all the positive feedback you can get .
You all look at a level of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> Intelligenz .
<unk> <unk> with the real world , not in the real world .
So , as I &apos;m here from here here from here , I &apos;m not going to be able to send an email from <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> verrückte Idee .
So I can do not get into the real world .
Now , the problem with all sorts of things , the World of Warcraft , ist , dass es so that , in fact , , in fact , that , in fact , , that &apos;s really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , about the fact of the matter , to be able to do all the time in the world .
It &apos;s a little bit more than the reality .
Now , you know , World of Warcraft , all the World of Warcraft , all the way to <unk> , is all the way to do that .
Now , that &apos;s not exactly something you have .
It &apos;s probably bad .
So , for sure , all the way to do that , is to make sure , <unk> Millionen of new things .
This is the first , <unk> Primat .
Okay , so , as I think about the time , the amount of time that in the process , is the way , in the course of the same way , the one way , in the same way , is that , in the same way , he would think , in the same way , in the Kontext of the menschlichen <unk> , that was a very incredible thing .
But it &apos;s really good . It turns out that , in fact , , it &apos;s the way that we can do so with Spiele , in fact , in fact , in the same way , in fact , , in fact , , in fact , , in fact , the way we can live in the world .
So it turns out that in a way that &apos;s more <unk> and <unk> .
This is where . I know .
So , think about it , right ?
It &apos;s been done by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University .
Now , the average person , in a country with a high school , is living in a high age of <unk> , and it will have been 10,000 Stunden <unk> .
Now , in fact , 10,000 miles ist a very interesting difference for two Gründe .
So , for kids , for kids in the United States , is the most important thing that man ever can do at the city of the city out of the city at the top of the city , as ever as you get to yourself .
So , now , we have a very , very exciting work , working with kids , where young people often have been taking care of them .
Now , some of you , some of them have <unk> <unk> &apos;s book .
So , you know , you &apos;re probably looking at your <unk> , the 10,000 times <unk> .
There is an amazing thing to know , some of the most ancient times that that tells you that , when we need 10,000 Stunden to help , on average , it was on the end of the day .
So , let &apos;s make sure , in fact , in the past , that was the best way of the world .
And so , here , the whole Generation , the most incredible cell kids are living in the Spielen .
So , the great question is , &quot; Was like to do so with good ? &quot;
Because , as I was able to figure out , here , we would have to be able to share a virtual little musical with each other .
And that &apos;s the number one people who live in the world , working in the world for example .
This is our <unk> .
There are 500 million people who are pretty much in some sense .
And in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve got to have a Milliarde in the past , which is pretty good in anything .
Now , when you don &apos;t know it &apos;s all .
The <unk> is <unk> , and that &apos;s the small electric force , and with some people working on the Internet , so that the models of the world are , most of the things , China and Brasilien , is online .
They &apos;re expecting a Milliarde to the least in the past decade .
That bringt uns at 1.5 Billionen models .
So I ’ m going to have been wondering , in the course of these Spiele as well .
I have been able to see four things . This one is <unk> positive .
Okay . So here &apos;s the way you can see as extreme <unk> .
<unk> Optimismus is the way to fight , to do a <unk> , working with the Glauben , that , in fact , that , at the moment , we &apos;re at the positive level .
<unk> , all of the time , a &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; , and that it &apos;s all worth spreading , and it will be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> in the core of a dense social resource .
And he &apos;s a lot of interesting science that tells us that , as you can , the people are looking for them with them , all of them , all of them .
And that &apos;s the talk to you , because your ears are going to be playing a game .
And so , in fact , they &apos;ll be able to make their sense , they have been able to make the difference in the same way that they have the same Regeln spielen , they &apos;ll keep the same thing , they &apos;re dead .
So , with a game , with a lot of <unk> , the <unk> and the social justice system .
And as soon as it &apos;s done , we &apos;ve got a lot of other soziale Beziehungen .
<unk> <unk> . Excellent .
You know , he &apos;s talking to the fact that the average World of Warcraft is 22 Stunden pro Woche playing 22 Stunden pro Woche .
So , it turns out that , as I know , we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , we &apos;re really glücklicher , so we can be out of sleep in the same way .
So , here , we know , as people made , as you can make a lot of work .
And if you can do that , you can make a lot more work than it makes the real work .
And finally , epic Bedeutung .
<unk> was something that was an important thing to be performing an age of <unk> .
So , here , a little bit of <unk> , so that &apos;s a little <unk> .
You all know Wikipedia , the most beautiful <unk> in the world .
The other most of the biggest <unk> in the world with fast 80,000 Artikel is the World of Warcraft .
Five hundred million people are all working on it .
They spent more <unk> World of Warcraft with World of Warcraft in the Internet , so it &apos;s taken by another part .
They &apos;re all called <unk> .
They &apos;re at all , at World Food and over World of Warcraft .
Okay , so it &apos;s got four out of some of them in one thing .
<unk> are <unk> , <unk> .
This is the people who will make a difference in the world .
And the only thing that they &apos;ll be able to do is , they &apos;ll be able to drive virtuellen Welten and not the real world .
So that &apos;s the work that I &apos;m talking about .
He &apos;s a scientist , Edward <unk> .
You know , there &apos;s brilliant . It thinks that there &apos;s a lot of time , and there is a lot of time and money around the world .
And they said , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re missing an almost impossible <unk> in virtuellen fields at virtuellen Welten and <unk> . &quot;
And it &apos;s a scientist , and it &apos;s rational .
And it doesn &apos;t mean like I , I &apos;m a <unk> . I &apos;m <unk> .
But , you know , it &apos;s pretty logical , because if you can do that , you can do that in a online world than in the real world .
And they can be healthy , in Spielen , as in the real world .
They get more positive positive and more positive games in Spielen like real .
And so it says , &quot; So it makes perfect sense that , in fact , the reputation in virtuellen Welten would be in the real world .
So , I think , &quot; I mean , that is rational .
But it &apos;s not an optimum thing .
So , here is the real world where you have a very high school rate .
So , I think I was able to do anything about anything like 2,500 .
So these are the big scales , and it &apos;s made out of <unk> . OK ?
So , for cool world , we have <unk> .
And this is the most valuable Werkzeug for this to be on the phone .
And when you know the invention of the original griechischen Historiker <unk> , you know , you know all the way .
The news from the top , and why they did that .
<unk> say , &quot; Spiele , you know , are at all the time , at all , in the kingdom , in the Königreich , <unk> by a Hungersnot .
And pretty much what it looks like that , the König from <unk> , is to do so with anything <unk> .
People <unk> .
It &apos;s a extreme situation . They were at the extreme level .
So , you know , <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
One time , the one thing is , is all .
The same time , playing all the way to do that .
And they &apos;re going to be trapped in their own game , so they &apos;re so curious , and they &apos;re so curious , and <unk> in such a <unk> way that they weren &apos;t going to be <unk> .
The time , they make a lot of the work .
They &apos;re looking for them .
And they &apos;re looking for <unk> all 18 years .
They &apos;re looking at a time for a time to cook again and the same time .
So , I think , in fact , this is now , in fact , that , in fact , that is , in fact , the same thing is , right ?
So , we &apos;re using Spiele for the heart out of the real world .
So , it &apos;s used to be able to hear out of everything outside , all the way out of the real world , everything was not curious about the real world , and , in the real world , it was all about Spiele .
You don &apos;t want to end it up .
This is very exciting .
You know , after 18 years , you don &apos;t have any more part of the Hungersnot .
And so , the König , she &apos;s got to be a pretty real <unk> .
They all share the whole Königreich .
They all played a <unk> , and the Gewinner of the play liked to be a <unk> Abenteuer .
They were <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re looking at a neuen neighborhood .
And so , in fact , it &apos;s gone on the other side of the food that he was able to go out , and he would be able to get away from somebody else &apos;s body .
So , it seems like , yeah , it seems like , right ?
Now , in fact , the evidence to tell DNA is that the <unk> that are suffering from the <unk> , the <unk> , the same DNA as the <unk> .
And so that &apos;s why , in fact , this is an important thing to do , the <unk> &apos; holy Story .
And Geologen figured out that there are the first place to make 20 years of change in the end of the war .
And so that &apos;s all the way you can see .
You can make sure that they &apos;re going to be able to make a sense of Spielen in the game for 18 years , and so forth , and so forth and so forth , and so forth , and so you all have been able to get away from a lot of the things that they do .
Okay , so that &apos;s all the time .
You &apos;ve heard of World of 1994 .
This is what the previous <unk> in the World of World <unk> .
They all look for 18 years , and they all played World over 16 years .
I mean , I &apos;ll be able to make our own <unk> .
So they take the help out of the people in a small world .
And so I &apos;m sure , in my own case , I take my 21 thousand pieces of furniture .
So , here is the help us , in a Stunde , a Stunde am designing for the next year , in the real world .
Now , I know , I was like , &quot; How do you say , &quot; So , how do you make the work with Spielen ? &quot; So , that &apos;s where I have spent my work in the last couple of weeks for the U.S .
So , we have a <unk> in our own environment in Palo Alto , and it puts our Standpunkt out of the way that man will behandeln with the children .
We don &apos;t want to see it .
We will make them formen .
We &apos;re the best way to do the best way .
And , as you can , the reality is that the reality is that you can make the sense of reality .
We have been happy , and , as I said , &quot; <unk> , can people give the money to make their work . &quot;
So I &apos;ll give you some of the examples of the same time , I &apos;ve made the sound of the fact that I have been able to give people the tools to save their own lives .
Okay , here is World Ohne Oil .
So , in 2007 , it was in 2007 .
This is a <unk> , in the process , in the process , working in the process .
And the Mangel is <unk> , but , in fact , we don &apos;t have been able to talk to you , because it &apos;s real , and , and , you know , the real world is alive , and , as you can , your real life will be alive .
So , here is the <unk> , and this is <unk> , and this is the most part of the reason that the answer was that &apos;s not to be able to do this , and that &apos;s not able to be able to do this , and the schools are geschlossen .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the real world is so if you can do this . And then he asked him a blog and <unk> .
So , here &apos;s the rate of <unk> in 2007 .
And so we did them for the three .
And I &apos;ll tell you that this is a <unk> Erlebnis .
No one wants to be a human race , but it &apos;s really good for the world , oder , because , you know .
But when you put them in a <unk> background , and they said , &quot; We don &apos;t have to be doing that . &quot;
So that &apos;s all the way that I think is a very cool story .
<unk> <unk> out of the way , right ?
The fact that they do , they throw their little rate in the game .
And so , for the same <unk> , they were working in the same way , as a result , almost as happy as an accident .
So , here was a game called <unk> Institute for the Institute for The <unk> .
The tone of what a Supercomputer would have been published , that one thing happened to be 23 .
Now , this <unk> thing to do with was the name Global <unk> System .
So , we &apos;re looking at people online , fast as Jerry <unk> .
You know , Jerry <unk> , you know , is a <unk> .
So , the <unk> , the designers , the <unk> , the <unk> , and they have <unk> the world .
But , in unserem Spiel , we have , at five other things , at the <unk> , every one of the other things , and that is your work , and it &apos;s your work for your friends , the Zukunft of Ernährung , the Zukunft of security , Zukunft and Zukunft des sozialen <unk> .
We add 8,000 people up for eight pieces .
They &apos;re all familiar with 500 other kreative Lösungen , that man will be at Google <unk> .
And finally , the last game , we end up at the top März .
Now , as you <unk> the game , you &apos;ve been able to be <unk> by the World Bank , as a <unk> , D.C .
<unk> with my colleagues in Africa , and they &apos;re inviting them to the local <unk> .
So , here is a <unk> . We have a system with both of these sorts of things , as a local , background , vision , vision and Genialität .
So , I would all be here , all of you , like , to share the game together with young people , all the way , in the world , is pretty much in the world , most of the things that help them make their own social commodities .
So I &apos;m just ready .
I &apos;ll ask you .
So , do you think he was able to do this ?
We all have these fantastic models , all the way , these are the ideas from , of course , all the way they can do , but none of them have the real world .
Now , I hoffe , that would come with me , because , to me , the models are a human being , that man will actually use the real world to help the real world .
We all have all these beautiful <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the possibility to be a dense , sozialen power , and this sense of sounds of <unk> positive .
And I really appreciate that , in fact , that in the same way , I can make Spiele that make a difference in the same way that one live in the planet .
And that hoffe , I &apos;m going to do this with me , and I &apos;m going to make it in love with me .
Now , when I was looking at the least , I was able to do with the nächstes Jahrzehnt , I &apos;ll be able to make sure that all of us can formen all of us , and , of course , all of us spielen all the way that we can .
So , let me tell you , let &apos;s start playing the game .
Thank you .
For every time , I was interested in <unk> .
And it seems to be a look for a mirror , unless , as you can , the reality is that , as I was , is that , &quot; I mean , &quot; that &apos;s something that &apos;s done , it &apos;s so clear that it will be real . &quot; In other words , <unk> <unk> in some studies .
Just as the person thinking thinks that it was a <unk> thing that was a <unk> Werkzeug ,
For the heart of hearts , when you think , as you can , as you can be able to do so , it &apos;s a lethal force , and it will be <unk> .
One thing that is , actually , is that , is it really , really , really , jemandes Wahrnehmung .
And , in order to attack , I will be aware of , and I will start with a very simple sound .
And I &apos;ll just show you why . Dieser Trick is very , very , very , very , very soon for children to watch for children .
I put it on a small moment in the &apos; 60s , and I was put it in the &apos; 60s .
I &apos;ll do the trick , and I &apos;ll leave you with it .
And then I &apos;ll leave you with me .
So this is the point .
Your <unk> , you know , is my hand .
I &apos;m trying to do this in my way in my way .
I &apos;m a Ärmel <unk> .
And he would be able to be in my front of my Ärmel <unk> , and I &apos;m down here in my <unk> .
So you can see , he &apos;s not an exercise .
So , as long as I <unk> out here , he &apos;s not in and out of my Ärmel .
It &apos;s very simple .
I &apos;m able to open my hand , and I &apos;m sure , when it &apos;s okay , my mistake is that my translation is actually <unk> .
So that <unk> is so clear so that I can <unk> the <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> .
I don &apos;t care in my Ärmel , kein <unk> .
<unk> !
Now , I have been talking to that , because , I think , is a very interesting thing to do when I was interested in <unk> , because , you know , you can go out of <unk> of <unk> .
So , again , the trick is , in fact , , in fact , the trick is very simple .
Now , you know , you know , any of you know .
So this is the point .
I &apos;m just doing this Messer in my hand .
I said , &quot; I mean , I <unk> my face to make sure that he &apos;s not in and out of my Ärmel .
That is lying .
Now , the talk that I <unk> out of my face is the secret of the Illusion .
So , in my time , my hand was <unk> , and I mean , in my little way , my little place , in one in the next way , is <unk> .
&quot; So , don &apos;t cool . &quot;
So it is so .
And when I was <unk> , my Finger turns .
So , here &apos;s the reason , the reason why that &apos;s <unk> is why he &apos;s not aware that he &apos;s <unk> out there .
It turns out that , it &apos;s because , the brain is <unk> in a way , in a way , not , three , three , but <unk> .
But here is not real ?
It doesn &apos;t mean that this is not the <unk> , but it &apos;s the <unk> , by the time of the space .
And when I <unk> my hand , it &apos;s the same thing .
And when I <unk> out , I <unk> all of the time , I &apos;m going to <unk> my place .
I get rid of my hand . You take a look out .
So , a very nice word that man for Freunde and Familie will do .
So , do this with <unk> ?
So I think about it , I was reading a study of her study .
I don &apos;t have to be a scientist , so what it was like that .
And it turns out that when you have some Placebo in the form of the universe , it seems to be a <unk> mathematical Pille , so it &apos;s <unk> .
Make wonder when it comes in the past , in the way , in a small sense , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and when man gets a Buchstaben in the board , then the Placebo <unk> effektiver .
And , in fact , no one of the other forms of <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
But a human being is not so much than a Blauwal .
What ? I mean , I was really at the top , really , really .
But in fact , you can have <unk> .
It turns out that <unk> are effektiver as well as in the kind of <unk> .
You see , a farbige tap , gelb to the one and rot on the other side , is a little black .
<unk> is something that matters .
One Pille is not so good at the same time as three <unk> , and I don &apos;t have any chance to worry about it , sorry .
But the reason is that , ...
<unk> spielen .
And the way that you make a sense .
And for the ultimativen , <unk> <unk> , he was going to be able to be in the <unk> .
Yes , yes ? A <unk> with a number of <unk> at a certain kind of <unk> , in a human being , in a human being .
There is a tremendous spread in your memory .
It &apos;s a lot of paint as the real black signal .
Let &apos;s show you the same time , as we can see the answer .
The point is , the weißen Pille is not so much than the blauen , so it &apos;s not so much as good as the <unk> .
And none of them have a real sense of <unk> .
And , as you get out , it makes them happen in our own body , and a <unk> effect .
I want to see if I was able to do the idea in a lot like a trick .
I want to do something that was a trick , and it seems to me .
And the study of the time , as you know , is the way , in the way , she was able to handle that .
This is a very , very 18 Zentimeter , very 18 Zentimeter .
I &apos;m a little <unk> here .
I mean , that &apos;s actually my Fleisch . This is no besonderes <unk> .
This is my Haut . This is not <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> my Haut and <unk> my body down and I &apos;m <unk> .
Now , as a <unk> , when you get away , I was gestern a magic trick for a few Freunde and some people I didn &apos;t know .
A woman walked into her <unk> .
So I think that when you are <unk> , as you are <unk> , you know , you know , I was like , &quot; I mean , I do this a little bit .
You can look at it , no one thing you want .
So this is the point .
<unk> my poor , I make a small little break .
Sorry , you . Is this <unk> ?
And then , in my head , I was a little bit out of my wall .
So , in the past , we have fallen at the same way as the <unk> .
So one thing .
You can do that , right ?
I &apos;m here . Here &apos;s one , two , three , four , five , five .
Yeah ...
I think people think , as they do this .
And they think , &quot; It &apos;s not dumm genug , to yourself for some matter to yourself , for some of the rest of your public face . &quot;
So what it looks like ?
Yes , I know . The people in front of you say , &quot; OK , here is not real . &quot;
So let me tell you about it .
I mean , that is real . There is no Hollywood .
I mean , this is my taste . I can do the pin .
Sorry . Now , as it becomes too much , it &apos;s not going to be dead .
Now , people in front of you , at the same time , at the same time , in the course of the picture , they would say , &quot; It seems to be a very , very special effect , but when it &apos;s real , it would be a Loch and there , and when it &apos;s real , it would be <unk> . &quot;
Yes , it is .
I mean , by the way , I can control the Nadel .
I &apos;m going to clean my little and clean out my little <unk> .
But , in diesem Zusammenhang , and with the idea of something , it was actually something that &apos;s fake , and it &apos;s real , I &apos;m the Nadel , and I &apos;ll be able to do so with it .
For the end of the few weeks , I &apos;ll be there .
Now , do you want to look at it .
I have seen a lot of things in my life .
I was able to do by my own two .
The first one that looks like a <unk> <unk> .
It makes a sense that a nice fish , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
One of the things that a fish .
So that &apos;s a little bit of <unk> for the most good private leaders at the top of Nachhaltigkeit .
So that &apos;s what makes you feel good about it .
I have a very , very small face , and I had a very , very few conversations .
And I would like to call it a second , and I would like to call that , I &apos;m going to come into a real field of business at the moment that I &apos;m going to be on a real scale .
&quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; I said .
And here is what a company that was going on here , that this was going to be able to go out , and this was the pretty exciting thing for our <unk> .
So , how do we do that ?
In the last 50 years , we have been able to see the fish in the last 50 years .
It &apos;s a total rate of <unk> .
Ninety percent of the big fish , which was the animals , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s fast not so much .
So , so , so , so , so , as well as it &apos;s bad , it &apos;s so bad about it , <unk> , <unk> .
And it seems to be very , very carefully .
Plastic verschmutzen , so the most part of them , they &apos;re not good at them .
A lot of the time .
It &apos;s got 15 to 1 percent .
It means that he &apos;s got to be a <unk> , because he &apos;s got to be a pound of <unk> .
It &apos;s not exactly nachhaltig .
And it doesn &apos;t really make sure .
So here &apos;s what it &apos;s done to us to make sure that it was going to happen .
I want to talk to them .
The next time I got to the graphs of the company , I was able to PR the size of the company .
Don &apos;t let it say .
&quot; Don &apos;t say , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , to make sure that you know , there are so many of them in See , so you can &apos;t verschmutzen . &quot;
It says , &quot; It says . &quot;
And they said , &quot; So , we &apos;re on the <unk> .
The <unk> ? Number two to one , say , &quot; Well , the best in the Geschäft . &quot;
2.5 percent .
&quot; 2.5 to one , was ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> Proteine . &quot;
&quot; Awesome . &quot;
And the night , I was on the Bett , and I thought , do that in God &apos;s food ?
So the same time , right now , I didn &apos;t call for the graphs for the graphs .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t do that , do you know ? &quot;
And er would say it didn &apos;t figure out .
And so I would have a number of people in the developing world .
No one thing you can do is to make sure .
By the time I finally got the <unk> , I was able to make sure .
Let &apos;s just throw it off .
&quot; Don &apos;t say , &quot; So , do I mean , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
Well , it &apos;s just a very , very <unk> and some <unk> , and then there &apos;s <unk> .
I said , &quot; Huh ? &quot;
It said , &quot; Yeah , sure , <unk> , Haut , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> dead . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Welchen Anteil do you know ? &quot;
Think about two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Don &apos;t do that , but , do you know ? &quot;
It took a long time a long time and said , &quot; He can be too much Hühnchen in the world . &quot;
I mean , my love for my food .
No , not , I don &apos;t want to be a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I do that .
I mean , I don &apos;t get my love for this fish , but , I schwöre , I call it , I think , the process , the fish , as you know , when I think , that , I think , is that .
The other fish , which is a very different <unk> .
It &apos;s the romantic way , the most romantic , most of the time that man &apos;s used to know that man &apos;s very , very much of the food .
I &apos;m not going to talk to it for it in <unk> .
For a long time for a long time , a very long time for this food technology .
It has a little bit of <unk> .
There is a very , very little , very little , very heavy , very exquisite .
The Koch had become <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty much <unk> .
Something &apos;s really cool .
So , how do you make a good thing as good as good as it &apos;s used to <unk> ?
I don &apos;t , but I don &apos;t .
So , let &apos;s talk about Miguel .
So , you know , you know , <unk> is <unk> .
No , it &apos;s not going to buy the fish , and it &apos;s not Koch .
Zumindest in the way , not as you and I know .
It &apos;s a bee in <unk> La <unk> .
This is a <unk> in the Gulf of Spanien .
And that is a matter of <unk> Fluss .
Now , in the course of the 80ern , that &apos;s the most part of the year .
It &apos;s most unusual for most of them , most of the time .
They were doing this on the ground .
They all have a complex <unk> , and they <unk> the Wasser from the land .
It &apos;s not going to be able to do that .
And ökologisch gesehen , what it looks like ?
Ninety percent of the natural species ended up .
So it &apos;s really , really , really , really , really natural Vögel .
And so , in 1982 , it &apos;s built a <unk> and a Spanisch .
What did they do ?
They have the <unk> .
They set up the trains .
If you don &apos;t have a food system , then they used to be able to throw it out .
They make the parts of the water .
They have a small Hektar blue whale -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and <unk> , <unk> -- and all over the course , you have the ökologischen equivalent of <unk> .
The <unk> is fantastic .
I mean , that &apos;s not something that you see .
Now , here is the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and all of the sudden all the sudden , the <unk> and the blue , the very large , very , very , very low collapse .
It &apos;s not so long her on <unk> .
You know , there &apos;s a great deal , third , third , third Charles Darwin and a third of the land .
OK ? Here we have , <unk> , <unk> by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and Schlamm , and <unk> a <unk> .
There is a little bit of <unk> <unk> .
Now look at the <unk> of the Phytoplankton .
And here , here , here , here , here , here , here is a <unk> , there &apos;s something that thinks it &apos;s <unk> .
And it turns out that , if you have a Großteil seines work , you know , that , if you have a Großteil seiner Karriere in Africa .
I &apos;m going to try and wonder why it turned out to be a <unk> .
And it said , &quot; Huh ? I know , I know no one .
I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot;
And so it &apos;s going to go away from the very , very quickly , and so it &apos;s a very , very good <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to be falsch an accident , so it &apos;s really exciting to me .
It &apos;s kind of cool , but I felt that .
And my agenda is <unk> , and I think about the very , very little , very little , very <unk> .
So I would like to throw it , and I said , &quot; So , <unk> , you know , that &apos;s the way that our lunch ?
It turns on to the Algen .
&quot; I know , you , the Algen , the Algen , the <unk> , the Beziehungen , it &apos;s fantastic .
But , do you know ?
Was the <unk> ? &quot;
And then it comes to me with me to tell you that , as a <unk> system , there was such a way that the food was used to cook .
The <unk> , the Phytoplankton , the human Plankton , that &apos;s the most part of the wild .
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s all <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have any time .
So , take a look at a Farm , they don &apos;t know ?
And later , I &apos;m going to spend a little bit of <unk> on my heart , and I said , &quot; For a way , I said , &quot; For a place that would be so , &quot; If you can do all the way that I can do that ? &quot;
In that moment , it turns out that if you look at the time , it would be <unk> .
And so we walked out of the left , and the most beautiful picture , and it turns out that Tausende and Abertausende <unk> of <unk> <unk> , so you can see .
&quot; That &apos;s the Erfolg , &quot; said that .
&quot; Look to her <unk> , <unk> .
They &apos;re on the Party . &quot;
<unk> ? I mean , what &apos;s pretty real .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t make any sense to make any sense to your Fisch ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ! &quot;
&quot; We have to go 20 percent of our food and <unk> to the birds .
And last year , it had about 600,000 experiments , at least 250 species of species .
It was the most part of the very , very , very <unk> private population in Europe . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Now , <unk> is a <unk> , that &apos;s not the last one , do not make any sense that you will do in a <unk> ? &quot;
It turned out to be the motor .
It said , &quot; We have <unk> <unk> .
This is a very , very weak .
The <unk> fressen the <unk> .
The <unk> fressen the Phytoplankton .
So that &apos;s why , in the way , is that <unk> , as well as a result . &quot;
OK , let &apos;s see .
They don &apos;t want to be <unk> . They don &apos;t want to be <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
Oh , and , you know , the <unk> that shouldn &apos;t be here .
It <unk> in a small city , at 250 miles away , where the ants are working on the surface .
Each one of them starts at 250 miles an hour .
And every day , she starts at 250 miles away .
They do that , they do that , because they &apos;re going to be able to do the root system from the <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
And I would like to tell you a little bit about it , and it turns out that I &apos;m seeing Miguel .
And I said , &quot; Well , do you think about 250 miles an hour , at the same time , at 250 miles away ?
Does they do that for the next time ? &quot;
And it turns out that I would look like a Whitney Whitney <unk> .
And it said , &quot; No . They &apos;re doing that .
I &apos;m not going to mention that I &apos;m not going to be erwähnt , which is not just erwähnt , which is really cool .
I don &apos;t really appreciate it . I don &apos;t really appreciate it .
It &apos;s the most important , and it &apos;s <unk> .
I &apos;m not comfortable with it .
But if I add it into the Restaurant , in <unk> , it would not be <unk> .
And as you eat süß , it <unk> süß , if you take a taste out of the Meer .
I said something about Miguel and <unk> .
And it said , &quot; So , the way that you have said , &quot;
This is the most important thing , after that , is that , in addition to a little , out of the body .
And it turns out that it &apos;s <unk> to suck . &quot;
And then you have to say , &quot; But with no <unk> . &quot;
OK . So , it &apos;s not <unk> .
And that is a species that will come out of the other side of the kingdom , the other act of being <unk> .
And so it turns out that there &apos;s something called a <unk> , which didn &apos;t make any <unk> <unk> , so it makes a huge drop out of <unk> .
So it &apos;s a Fluss that &apos;s used to be in the process of <unk> , and that &apos;s the process of using chemical <unk> , <unk> .
And as it comes out of the system and <unk> out of the system .
So the system is so healthy that it &apos;s <unk> .
So not only a <unk> species that are not <unk> , not only a <unk> that are the size of the human being , but it &apos;s not just a <unk> that &apos;s the <unk> .
It wasn &apos;t just for the Fischen , but for them .
Now , when it comes out , when it comes to the Atlantic , it &apos;s got it in the Atlantic .
I mean , one single single deal in the Meer , I think , is , &quot; But I &apos;m sure , and , do you know , and that &apos;s the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
So you can say that , you know , that &apos;s a Rezept for the safe technology , where you have a very , very good vehicle for most of the time .
So , we have been working on the other side of the human species , one in the environment , and one in the environment is really gut .
And so for most of them , it &apos;s a little bit radikal .
We &apos;re not <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We can be from <unk> .
We can be very small <unk> .
We go from local food .
We fressen organic .
And as you can tell , that all the way you can make sure that all the way you can do , is something that says , &quot; Hey , you know , I think , &quot; Hey , I think , &quot; Hey , I liebe <unk> <unk> .
How do you save the world ? &quot;
Can I be fair ?
I &apos;m not the question .
No , no , no , no , and no more than that , it &apos;s not enough <unk> to feed the world .
It &apos;s a Milliarde time every year .
One Milliarde -- that &apos;s the most important thing you can do today -- and it &apos;s not the number .
I &apos;m not the most important thing to do , though , though , it would be by , by the way , in the next 50 years .
And <unk> <unk> an <unk> , Pestizide <unk> an industrial engineer , used to be used to fish , and the whole <unk> <unk> , and all the <unk> would say , &quot; When we can feed people .
So this is all the time .
It ’ s the <unk> .
It was all about the U.S . Security Council .
It was like , &quot; We have heard about it , a game in <unk> , and it will make a sense that , in a way , that &apos;s the very , very , very <unk> .
It &apos;s not all , and it &apos;s not <unk> .
Now , as you can go out of the body , it doesn &apos;t have been <unk> with <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t make an awful lot of hours and <unk> with the <unk> and <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t go with Pumpen , but of course , with some hundreds of thousands of people , not with <unk> and nice , but because of the fish in the Meer .
Do you know the world ?
So , let &apos;s start with the question : How do you know ?
Or , do you better , and , where do we have environments where everybody else will be ernähren ?
So , the way that you do , don &apos;t look at the same way that you can do the most .
It &apos;s alt and it &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s a huge amount of money , and it &apos;s a lot of money , Chemikalien and Maschinen , and it doesn &apos;t make anything much more positive .
Now , let &apos;s look at the <unk> , right ?
This is the Model that it tells you that in the past , it vertrauen to the two Milliarden years .
So , you know , <unk> , <unk> than <unk> , <unk> , who don &apos;t have their own <unk> <unk> and <unk> out of <unk> trees at the same time , and <unk> the <unk> trees , not only <unk> , but the other things are not only farmers .
And as I was really , really , really , really , you know , they &apos;ll be a besserer chef like me .
You know , I think , well , I think it &apos;s fine , but when you know , it &apos;s nice for me , as if you can .
Danke .
I grew up at a <unk> technology from Science Fiction .
In school , I went to school at school , a Stunde and a Stunde and every day .
And I get done by a book , a Science Fiction book , that I was at other Welten with other Welten , and that , in <unk> terms , my <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And , you know , the Neugierde <unk> in the course of the fact that I do , when I wasn &apos;t at the High School , I was in the Wald , <unk> and &apos; Monster &apos; <unk> , Frösche , Schlangen , Insekten and <unk> , and they ran out of the Mikroskop .
You know , I mean , I mean , I mean , I look at a real <unk> .
But it all came to know the most of the world , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And the love for Science Fiction , so it was <unk> <unk> in the world , so that it was done so that it was done by the end of the year , so we went on to Mond on the Mond , and I was able to see Jacques shrimp , and <unk> all the way to make the incredible <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> world and the <unk> world and a <unk> world .
And that would be <unk> with the whole Science Fiction .
And I look at a painting .
I would get zeichnen . I would be painting .
And so he didn &apos;t have a video game and all of the images of <unk> Filmen and all the images in the Medienlandschaft , and I would make the picture in my own way .
You know , that &apos;s all the way that we all have , as a child , started looking at a book , and it was the visual interpretation of the book .
And my response to that : <unk> , <unk> <unk> , außerirdische Welten , <unk> , all sorts of things .
I &apos;m getting into <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There is the sense that they can do the way the way they can do .
And he found an interesting thing , the Jacques Cousteau &apos;s <unk> , and he made me feel so happy about the fact that he could be a außerirdische Welt .
I would probably not be at a <unk> world in a <unk> way .
It would be pretty unwahrscheinlich .
But what you see here is that , in fact , there was a way that I could go out there that so reich and exotic and exotic as anything that I would call <unk> , by drawing the book .
And so I found that in the past , I would get to be in the past 15 years .
And das einzige Problem , in Canada , that I live in a small small village in Canada , 600 Meilen away .
But I didn &apos;t have <unk> .
I <unk> at my Vaters , if er finally , at Buffalo , New York City , New York City , New York City .
And I would make a <unk> , in a Pool by <unk> , at Buffalo , New York .
And I saw the Ozean , a real Ozean , not dead until recently , if we were in California .
Seitdem , in the <unk> 40 years , I spent about 3,000 Stunden working on Wasser , and 500 Stunden of it in <unk> .
And I found that the <unk> Umfeld , and even the <unk> Meer , so reich are so rich with the fact that it was actually <unk> .
The <unk> of the Natur is so <unk> , not <unk> , human imagination .
Now , at the time , I have been doing great Ehrfurcht for this very little Ehrfurcht .
And my <unk> <unk> for the Meer is so far as you can .
But if I look at a time when I was a scientist , what &apos;s the nickname .
And that would be the best way that I would like to tell you , I was going to tell the stories that I was going to be talking about , and I was <unk> .
And as a kind of thing , I was doing this thing with <unk> , and , etc .
So film made the way the way the way to make Abbildungen and Erzählungen together .
And , well , the Geschichten that I know , Science Fiction , <unk> Geschichten : &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; Aliens , &quot; and &quot; The <unk> . &quot;
And with &quot; The <unk> &quot; , then I took my love for <unk> and Tauchen together with Filme .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
There was something interesting about &quot; The <unk> &quot; , which , in fact , , in the past , working on the other side of the Film , the <unk> of flüssigem <unk> Wesen , <unk> , <unk> .
And this is <unk> in the past &apos; soft <unk> , the <unk> Animation that you can .
And so , in fact , the Film of the Film I wouldn &apos;t tell you about , I mean , it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> , which I mean by what I was able to see about , which is the most amazing thing , the global global experience .
You know , it &apos;s Arthur <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> , that all <unk> out of the future is not <unk> .
They see something magical .
And it turns out that I was really aufgeregt .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , this is something that <unk> werden in the <unk> . &quot;
So , with &quot; <unk> 2 &quot; , my other Film , on my left .
<unk> with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> into the Film , and the Erfolg depended on the ground .
And so it was done . And then , again , <unk> .
And so we were facing the whole thing .
We have been doing a little bit of money on the movie .
So , in order to move to the two of the two points of time , it turned out to be a whole , one very , very , very , very , very well <unk> .
So , I started a company with <unk> Winston , and my personal friend <unk> Winston , like <unk> and <unk> war in the same way , and it was &quot; Digital <unk> &quot; .
And the idea of that , what that was like , I would like to make a Sprung , an astronaut of <unk> <unk> , and and that and the same way that we move from digital technology .
And that &apos;s what happened , and it would give us a <unk> Vorteil .
But , we were looking at <unk> , <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> and <unk> Winkel , for the <unk> and <unk> , for the next year .
So I &apos;d like to tell you that &quot; Avatar &quot; , &quot; The <unk> , &quot; which is , &quot; The <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> Effekte , <unk> Effekte , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> menschlichen <unk> in <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> would be <unk> .
And I would tell you , by the way , I would say , in my society , we &apos;re not able to do anything in there .
So I would like that in the Kühlschrank and I made the other Film from a small Schiff that it stopped .
I was like , &quot; Romeo and Julia &quot; I was like , &quot; Romeo and Julia &quot;
It will become a epic <unk> .
Now , I want to do what I was trying to do , I get to the real world called &quot; The <unk> &quot; .
And this is why I made the Film .
And that is the truth . Never wusste the system .
But I literally <unk> them . I said , &quot; So , let &apos;s go out .
So it was in the Öffnung of the Film .
It will be very , very wichtig . It will be a great term .
I would like to try to fund them to fund .
There &apos;s a lot of love . But this is the most part of your imagination that makes a reality experience .
Now , in fact , in fact , in fact , I actually started at a very , very large U-Boot in a Kenyan box , and it was two and a half feet tief in the North Atlantic , looking at the real Titanic , not high , not high , not high resolution , not high-definition .
I mean , that &apos;s pretty exciting .
And it was very , very <unk> , <unk> , mussten <unk> and all sorts of things .
But it was a lot of me on the end of my pack , so I found that , as a result , it was in <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s really technically technologically , and it became enormous .
So , in so you get in so much space , it turns out in the wrong way in the wrong world , where he can &apos;t be able to reproduce .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , it seems to be in a Science Fiction .
This is very cool .
And so , I mean , I had a sense of the fact that I was going to make a sense of the <unk> Ozean .
<unk> , the <unk> .
It was all . It war <unk> . It was <unk> . It was <unk> .
Because , you know , I would be able to visualize a human being , and I would be able to make a visual effect . I wouldn &apos;t imagine that I was able to visualize the wall .
And if you were a number of part of the field , I would have known subjects to see some of the pieces of paper and some things that I &apos;d never seen before , some things that were not seen before , who didn &apos;t have any people who were looking at them .
So what I mean by total <unk> and <unk> .
And so I made a look at a very curious way .
So , from the Erfolg of &quot; The Titanic &quot; , I said , &quot; OK , I <unk> my own turn to be a film as a <unk> , &quot;
And so we began to do this work .
And then we went to the <unk> , and we <unk> this <unk> .
We went out to the <unk> of the Titanic .
We took small &quot; <unk> &quot; , which was <unk> <unk> .
And the idea that goes on in the office and a <unk> study of the Schiff , had been done before .
No one thing you would never see in the <unk> .
So , here , here is now , on the Deck of the Titanic , <unk> in a U-Boot , and look at the outside , and look at some of the ones that I wusste , that the whole thing would make gespielt .
And I <unk> a little bit of <unk> .
So , as I say , I &apos;m going to be <unk> , but I &apos;m a feeling that I feel like I am , if I &apos;m a little bit at the bottom of the Titanic .
And it was the most <unk> kind of <unk> that I would be able to do , and I was going to figure out a <unk> , all of us , all the way that he <unk> the motor from the base of the vehicle for the whole thing , when I was at the beginning , <unk> on the ground .
And the set of things as a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the Schiff .
So what it was like to do was a pretty incredible story .
And it made me realize that , the <unk> Erleben , the real way , is that , in fact , <unk> <unk> , at the same time , in the same way , in the course of the brain .
It &apos;s pretty deeply <unk> .
And maybe a little bit of a sudden , there was some of the time , there was a way of seeing the way , as a <unk> and other experiences , in many cases , other experiences , in many types of <unk> <unk> .
So , these Expeditionen were done now , and it was really , really , really , was there , as a <unk> , where he was safe , where he all had these erstaunlichen things .
They &apos;re pretty little <unk> on Earth .
They live in <unk> .
They don &apos;t have been working in a <unk> system like that .
And so it turns out these animals are living with 500 percent <unk> passive heiße <unk> .
You can think of it unmöglich .
In the same time , I was really interested in <unk> in <unk> , and again , the Science Fiction is actually the size of the way .
And I found an interest in the <unk> , very high school , NASA <unk> at NASA <unk> , actual <unk> , and I went to Russland , and I went to the <unk> biomedizinischen <unk> and all the things that have been working on the international Raumstation .
And this war faszinierend .
But that was the real result that I was at the moment , that I was at the age of <unk> .
And they all , they would have gone down to <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in extreme fields , they were interested in the extreme environment , and they were looking at the safe and three and hundreds of thousands of times .
So , here we were , like , <unk> all the way , but actually , it was an American history .
I &apos;d be a little bit about the Science of Science at the Science Fiction , so I think , as a kind of thing and all of them do .
And you know , all over my journey , I lernte one out .
So I was able to get a lot of science to science . But I lernte one Menge of the leaders .
Now , imagine if you think , that , a <unk> , will be , but , of course , used to be , Captain &apos;s from the Schiff .
I didn &apos;t really know by <unk> by <unk> at the time .
Now , I have to say , &quot; What do I do here ?
Why do I do this ? What do I make ? &quot;
We don &apos;t make any money in the world .
They &apos;re not <unk> <unk> . It doesn &apos;t have <unk> .
People think , in my way , I think I went away from &quot; The <unk> &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; , and I think , in fact , that I would make a place on the ground .
I all have all these Filme , all of the major things for a very , very very , very fast .
No <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no money . Was it ?
So , here is the work for the work , and the Ozean ist the most , and the Ozean ist the most , the <unk> Umfeld , and for the other , the <unk> verbindet that as a small demographic .
Because all of these things were working with <unk> people for decades .
Some of them for <unk> Monate <unk> .
And by the time , you know , the most exciting thing is that , the most exciting thing , is that for them , is that for them , for them , for you , to do something that makes you work , the story that will not talk to somebody else .
So , when you ran out of <unk> and said , &quot; We need this , and the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> and the <unk> , and all the technology and the Schwierigkeit , all the way , the most exciting thing you can do , is not to talk to people .
So it makes a bond , and it erschafft a Verbindung .
So if I left my front film , the &quot; Avatar &quot; , the &quot; Avatar &quot; , versuchte , <unk> to the fact of the <unk> , which is , in the family , taking care of their own value .
And this is really <unk> .
So , what I do with a small team , in my little <unk> , &quot; Avatar &quot; , &quot; Avatar &quot; , at all , from <unk> , neuer <unk> , who didn &apos;t have a little <unk> .
So it was incredibly exciting .
<unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to become a shelter for four and five years .
And it was completely changed , and it was completely changed .
And so , again , people <unk> on the ground , and the Ozean came out with them , and they would roll out of Pandora .
For me , what it was like to do was a fundamentalen way of doing things , and it turns out that when it comes to the end of it .
So , do you know all of us ?
You know , do the <unk> ?
Now , I think , I think a little <unk> .
It is the most amazing thing about its own .
<unk> is a <unk> reality , the real reality is in fact .
And as a matter of fact , the desire to help all of the world in the world .
And he gibt all these little <unk> to me and say , &quot; Give me a Rat to do this . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry .
Other people werden all the way to do , not to make sure , not to yourself .
And , take a bet . &quot;
NASA has this Sprichwort , in the case , &quot; <unk> is no means &quot; <unk> is no means .
You know , though , you know , you can be in the art and Entdeckung , because it was a Sprung in the Tiefe .
And no one of the great great terms of Innovation has been working with no one .
You need to be bereit to make the <unk> .
And that is the reason that I will be on , that , in the past , is that , in the past , a Option , but the people aren &apos;t .
Now , when I just like to tell you a very high definition , it &apos;s the whole fact that , the whole data that we have , the whole data that &apos;s worth sharing .
And as I think about it , I think , in terms of <unk> information , I will think of the way that we know , as I was able to use information and the other way the other way the other unsichtbar is .
This is a typical male at the time .
The <unk> that I have here is a little bit .
It &apos;s called <unk> , and I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to be <unk> on the same thing in the same way , in the same way .
So I &apos;m going to take a look at a bunch of little Musters .
This is , in fact , here , in the middle of the world , that &apos;s the most active , and that &apos;s the <unk> .
So , you can go out of all the way and the data was the equivalent of an Todesursache .
So , the human and <unk> and Krebs are the general Verdächtigen , but not for everybody .
So , as I go out and down in the Alter of it , like , 40 years , like , 40 years on , the average will be the most successful attack .
Now , as you get out , it &apos;s very , very <unk> .
So , you know , I mean , here &apos;s the way you can look at information in a live way in a live way .
So , as you can do this with <unk> data , why don &apos;t you do with anything ?
So , here was the Titelseite of every single thing of sports at all night .
Everything is here . It &apos;s all right .
You can go out in the room , and it &apos;s all about my Talk .
You can go through a decade ago .
You can go through a very specific way .
So , you can jump to one thing .
So I think it turns out . I &apos;m seeing the Athleten that are in the number , the scales .
So I was Fan by <unk> Armstrong , so I &apos;m glad I <unk> , and that makes me all of the key things that <unk> Armstrong .
And as soon as I get here , I &apos;m thinking , &quot; Why don &apos;t all have this <unk> ? &quot;
So I &apos;ve got a little trip out here and I was in there .
So I was like Greg <unk> .
So , as you can see , when you get out of information , smaller and <unk> , in and out , and , you know , you don &apos;t know , how do you feel .
So , it &apos;s a little bit differently .
It &apos;s the same thing , and , in fact , it &apos;s been working on the way that man can use information .
So I &apos;m going to do this , like , a little bit of <unk> .
So here we have all of the pieces of Wikipedia and they &apos;re down dead .
And that &apos;s all about a little <unk> and a <unk> , and that &apos;s all the way that I &apos;m going to share with you .
I &apos;m just showing you the top 500 very carefully <unk> .
But , in fact , there was a very , very small way .
So , now we can get a sense of the public health at Wikipedia .
I go out and I &apos;ll be able to do that .
Now , I was able to tell you that , in fact , I &apos;m going to be able to tell you that , the <unk> that was the most important thing that you can do when people live in the year .
This is really , really , really , really , really , not in any of the <unk> <unk> .
So , the way you can do , it &apos;s just getting out , and it was all the time .
And when I was at one of the top of the conference , I was able to go out a lot of sleep at the notion of Time magazine , so I was able to tell you .
So , a very small view of all these people told me that , the most part of the city .
Some of them from the <unk> .
There is a little bit of a small number of industry .
This is my Chef .
One of the things that comes from the <unk> .
Now , what was interesting is that Bono : So that Bono is all , at TED .
So we can jump to all the TED <unk> .
So the way we &apos;re flying around the Web , if it &apos;s just a Web , it would not be at the Internet , but not at a very high rate .
So I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a story here , that you might be able to make sure .
I &apos;m showing you the New York Times here .
<unk> , all the world -- I will not speak &quot; , &quot; It doesn &apos;t mean &quot; There &apos;s no Browser , but you can see a wall of it -- and here is the <unk> technology at all .
I &apos;m getting out , I &apos;m getting out , in a very short section , right , right in a bestimmten place .
And the reason that this one thing is , I think , is that , in fact , I was able to look at the wall and I would like to look at the same way in the same way that I look at the same way .
I was able to see a lot of times in my own space .
So here &apos;s the Stand of the Vorführung that I have .
I can do some of the things that I &apos;m looking at .
So , when I was a little <unk> and everything , I would like to throw my <unk> out of my <unk> .
So here I did a little bit of <unk> research , and I went to see Bing Labs and here Live Labs .
So from here , I was able to go out of the wall , and I was starting to go back .
And it &apos;s all the way you can do , and it &apos;s all of the time , and it makes all the way you make the whole experience of the data from the data .
Today , in our world , we see ?
So , here is the Fluch of <unk> <unk> .
So , here &apos;s the <unk> in the data .
Now , as you can do that on board , and the Web at all , the Web at all , so in place , in place , then , in the next way , in the next , it was an hour later , so that man will be able to do all sorts of things .
So , as you can , in fact , in data , we can &apos;t see in data , so he can actually figure out information .
But as you can , instead of talking about information , he might be able to make any information .
So , as I can have a lot of information , he can actually experience a lot .
So , thanks to me , I can .
Now , every one of the great reasons .
I &apos;ve seen some of the number of books in the book , that in the past five of the world , in the book , and it would be waiting for about 40 , and he was very much more .
He &apos;s a very , very good Interesse for scientists .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
Everyone will do the way that we can make people glücklicher .
But , in fact , the whole lot of the work is a lot of kognitive <unk> , which is all the way that he can &apos;t think of happiness for positive issues .
And I &apos;m most likely to think of the <unk> <unk> .
So , here is the average people who thinks about their own happiness , and most of the ways that the researchers think is , is that , in fact , , in fact , that , in fact , , we are so much in the way that everybody else .
Now , the two guitar is the <unk> to help Komplexität .
It turns out that , the Wort positive is not more nützlich , so it turns out that , in too many ways , it &apos;s not too much .
I think he was such a sense , he was able to be <unk> , but all the way it was used to be out , ist all the way that we aufgeben and the more complex a sense of where Wohlbefinden safety is .
The other <unk> is the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> , which is , in the same way , , in the same way , in your lifetime , and happy with your Leben glücklich sein with your Leben oder very happy .
And these are two totally different things that have been in one of them , &quot; happiness . &quot;
And the third hand is the Illusion of <unk> and the unglücklichen reason , that , in the case , is not an ant , the impact on our Wohlbefinden in our Wohlbefinden will never <unk> .
I mean , this is actually a lot of pain .
He doesn &apos;t have to be good at all .
Now , I would like to start with a little bit of somebody on a <unk> and <unk> a meiner Vorträge erzählte a story .
And that is the story .
And er would tell you that there are a Symphonie <unk> , and it was absolutely incredible incredible Musik and am Ende the sound of the recording that he makes .
And then you would say , really , really <unk> , that all of the time the whole experience <unk> .
But it wasn &apos;t true .
It was all the time <unk> .
There was one thing .
It was all amazing what it was going to do for 20 minutes .
They were not worthy of something , because it would be <unk> for a Erinnerung ; the Erinnerung war something which was going on .
Was that to be <unk> , dass wir uns selbst and others in other words sehen können .
It &apos;s a <unk> I can live in the eyes and the reality that is , in fact , , in fact , that in the past , the reality is that it &apos;s all the time .
And the doctor konzentriert to us in our case -- ever , as the Arzt is called , &quot; Does it seem to be born here , <unk> , &quot;
And so he &apos;s <unk> , and I &apos;m the <unk> , and it &apos;s the <unk> and the Geschichte of our lives in our lives , and that is the person dead , and that is the next way to her to how er was to do the next way ?
Of course , &quot; What if you have gone into <unk> &quot; or so .
There are all sorts of very , very diverse things , <unk> and <unk> , and Verwirrung in both of the war from both the <unk> , that made her sense of happiness .
I mean , I &apos;m a narrator .
And it starts with a fundamentale Reaktion on the other side of our experience -- it starts right .
We don &apos;t just talk to the Geschichten , telling the story .
Our <unk> tells us all the time , that will say , was the reason , the reason , will be a Geschichte .
So , let me start with one of the examples .
This is a traditional study .
And these are actual patients doing this a schmerzhaften Eingriff .
I &apos;m going to spare you the Einzelheiten . This is not schmerzhaft for me , but it is schmerzhaft for me , in the &apos; 90s .
They wanted to be in all 60 Sekunden by their body .
And these are two people .
This is their <unk> .
And he would say , &quot; How about them do this ? &quot;
And it &apos;s a very , very einfachen set .
And it turns out that , the first thing you can do is get somebody else &apos;s mind .
There is a very , very long way , and for every human being , I get into every human being , a single human being given to one , and more .
But here is a different set of view : How many Schmerzen do think they have to do this ?
And that was a Überraschung to make sure that Patient is one of the most surprising <unk> times when you have Patient B.
The Geschichten of the <unk> <unk> , so a very , very , very , very , very passionate about the story -- and none of the Geschichten is very inspirierend -- but one one of them ist , but one one of them ist so much more than the other .
And the <unk> Geschichte is the Geschichte , in the end , in the end , in the end .
This is a nice story .
So , as you know ? Because , as you know , we would ask these people about their <unk> , and so it was very , very , very , very much ?
And it was much schlimmer for A to be B.
Now , this is a <unk> Konflikt zwischen dem <unk> and dem <unk> .
If you look at the point of view , I was able to get them , as well as you get older .
Well , , with a human being , and then , in fact , we did clinical trials , and that &apos;s what happened , and it &apos;s been working on the way , and it &apos;s working on the top of human being , and , you know , he would have been able to move in .
So this is something that makes the Patient get , but not so much , and it &apos;s not so much as a result .
And when you get out of some of the minutes , you know , for me , I made a lot of somebody who makes a lot of them made , and I think , for a lot of them , I made a lot of a lot of them , because , ever , the first one is a pretty good story .
Was a story ?
And that is the case for the number , the <unk> , and it &apos;s the reason for the Geschichten that I erfinden .
It was a story , really , very , very difficult periods and <unk> .
<unk> are very , very , very wichtig , and in that case , what it makes .
Now , I live alive will be alive .
It has Momente in terms of the other .
And , do you want to ask , do this ?
And the answer is very simple .
They &apos;re lost forever .
I mean , the most part of our lives -- I mean , I mean , you know -- the psychological space dauert about three minutes , usually says , &quot;
You know , in a lifetime , he &apos;s got 600 Millionen .
In a Monat , it is about 600,000 .
It won &apos;t be <unk> .
I mean , at the moment , I never would have been paying real attention .
And yet , in a matter of others , it makes a sense that they &apos;re being designed to make sure , that , in the case , is that , in the course of the brain , it &apos;s been alive .
It is the <unk> Ressource , which is <unk> , as we live on Earth .
And so the way it seems to be designed to be relevant , but the reason is not so much that it &apos;s <unk> for us .
So , here &apos;s the reason I do , and I &apos;m <unk> , and it &apos;s really quite different .
That &apos;s the big Unterschied in the crowd at the moment .
If you look at the point of view , I have a Urlaub , and , in fact , the next one is really good at the time , the next one is really good at the time , the Urlaub in the past .
So it doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> .
For example , I was a Urlaub in the past , I think , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , the Urlaub in the back is just better than the Urlaub in the past .
You don &apos;t have the story .
And in fact , the way that happens is the critical variable that I would like to be here from a <unk> .
In fact , a very small impact on the story .
The reason I &apos;d like to do was an interest in the same time and in the audience .
It is the person in the end , as you can do a human being , say , &quot; You can do two <unk> in the same order in order to do the better with each other . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a bias in the future .
We don &apos;t have to be the differences .
We are looking for the differences in the future . <unk> and even when we think in the Zukunft , we think , in the Zukunft , not an experience .
We denken an experience as a <unk> .
And so you can do this as a <unk> from the background , and , and , you know , you can see , and , as a <unk> , I would be able to shake the whole way through all the time , I didn &apos;t have a sense that , in fact , that , in the days , that , in the way , that , in the way , that , in the way , that , in the way , that , in the way , the most fun part is to serve the
And I think that &apos;s a very , very serious way .
So , how oft do we use all the time ?
This one is one of the answers that is led to the Dominanz of the <unk> .
And as I think about it , I think , in a way , I think , in the way , I think , in the past , the most of the time in the United States , which clearly the best pop day war , and I think he was a very , very much more common .
And I &apos;m probably going to have , in fact , all about three pieces of paper , for about 25 , for about 25 minutes .
Now , when I was able to do the same thing with the 600 <unk> , then I would have been able to have a Stunde .
That &apos;s also about 3 Wochen , and that is fast eineinhalb Stunden .
He seems to be a <unk> .
Now , maybe I was a little extreme , I think , in the awkward heart that I have , but even if you do that , the most important thing is that , the most important thing is that , why do we make an impact on the other side of the reason that we have been <unk> ?
So , I will think about it in a <unk> .
Now , in the next time , you &apos;ll know , in the end , that , in the end , you &apos;ll be able to get all the way you &apos;ll go out all the time , and gives you a Tablette , and you can make a sense that no one wants to be an .
How do we solve the problem ? And when man &apos;s looking at the other , he &apos;s looking at the other way , he will meet a Konflikt by man .
And , you know , he &apos;s thinking about her <unk> experience .
It was not so clear , because when you think about it in the same way , it makes a specific thing .
And when you think about it , you can think of somebody else .
Now , why , in the case , we have the <unk> auswählen which is a number , the most important thing to do with the two <unk> .
Now , the two <unk> suffer from <unk> <unk> .
He can actually have two other forms of happiness that man will do .
So , the way you can ask , is , is that , is that , is that curious , I guess ?
And then , you know , , how glücklich is the time in the world , in the future , I think ?
And all of the time , it &apos;s all , a very , very <unk> Prozess .
What are the Emotionen that can do ?
So , in fact , here is , in fact , , in fact , , in fact , , in fact , there was a very , very positive idea of the moment that I do .
Now , when you ask to , in the positive way , I was a pretty good thing .
So this is not why , in fact , , in fact , happiness is alive .
So it &apos;s been happy to be happy , when you think about it , when you think about it .
<unk> differently .
Now , every one of the students in a <unk> wirft a sense of <unk> , and I <unk> dead , and I <unk> dead a group of students in the world for a long time in the world .
And the distinction between the Glück , I &apos;m and the <unk> of the <unk> , I &apos;ve seen since the age of <unk> , and he gibt have been talking to the fact of the two separate other <unk> , the Gallup World Heritage Organization , at least like one halbe Million people asked questions about their Leben and their Erfahrungen .
And he &apos;s a lot more Bemühungen in the past .
In fact , in the weeks of course , we started receiving a chance of losing the two <unk> .
And the most extraordinary Lehre that was , I think , is that they &apos;re really among themselves .
You know , you know , you know , with your life with sein Leben , and it lehrt very much , really , really , really , really , how glücklich er sein will .
Just to make a sense of the average , the <unk> is about 0.5 .
So it says that , as you can do somebody , you can tell you that your Vater are at a big risk , and , in fact , how much would you have to know about its length ?
You know , you know , you know , you know , but he can do a lot of Unsicherheit .
Now , so many of the time you can do that , when I tell you that somebody would be a eight percent in a scale at a scale of 10 , so you can make sure that glücklich is that happy .
So , it &apos;s <unk> .
So , it was all about playing the way , I was <unk> .
We know that , as a matter of fact , is that , life is very , very wichtig .
We know that , in fact , that is , in fact , , in fact , that is , in fact , , we &apos;re happy with people , with people , with people , with people , the ones with them .
He &apos;s the other <unk> , but it wiegt .
So , as you can , as you can , it will increase in the two <unk> , will end up all the way the other things do .
And the reason that I said here ist , dass wir Glück nicht mögen , as <unk> as a <unk> für Wohlbefinden .
It &apos;s a completely different experience .
And it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very hard to think , in fact , , in fact , , in fact , that , in fact , , we don &apos;t have to think of the same thing as in the same way when we think about it , and when we do a real life .
So , when you ask the simple question , why are glücklichen people in California , not the richtige answer .
Now , when you ask the question , the people are glücklicher in California when you have <unk> in Ohio .
And it was , when you think about the world in California , think about the Gegensatz in America and other places , and the Gegensatz as in the Klima .
And it turns out that , the worst thing that is , is that , the worst thing to do is , I don &apos;t think , and I &apos;m not thinking about it , I think , in fact , that kind of glücklich people are .
But , it &apos;s <unk> , I can tell you that , in fact , it &apos;s going to be the way you can go out of California .
And it &apos;s been interesting , in fact , , in fact , , in the course of the people who was working in the United States at the time , in the course of the very , very <unk> .
So , their <unk> will not be glücklicher .
We know .
But one thing he did , she was thinking , they &apos;ll be glücklicher , because when she thinks she thinks she &apos;s in Ohio .
And they think they &apos;re thinking , they &apos;re the richtige Entscheidung .
It &apos;s very , very schwierig to think about well-being , and I hoffe , that I was able to make a sense of <unk> , and I was able to make a sense of <unk> .
Danke .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I &apos;ll ask for you .
Very much .
And if we were <unk> on the left , you would like to tell me that , he told me that he was going to be a very , very interesting <unk> .
Are you here with all the time , with a few minutes ?
Daniel <unk> : At least I think , the most interesting thing about the <unk> is that , the most interesting thing that we can &apos;t have erwartet .
And it has been working with the Glück , and it will make me .
So , as you can see , the emotional differences are abhängig of losing the Einkommen .
And it turns out that in the millions of 60,000 dollars pro Jahr , for America , and it was all about a whole bunch of good American , a large <unk> , a large <unk> Stahl , with one Einkommen of 1,600 dollars .
CA : 60,000 DK : 60,000 60,000 dollars in the process , and they found out the people unglücklich , and they have been looking for the poor .
So it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
I mean , I mean , I can look at a <unk> curve .
It was obvious , it was , because , don &apos;t have been <unk> , but a Mangel an effort to do with no pain , and the pain in the absence of pain , and the real pain of <unk> .
For the other thing I do , I was a very , very different story .
You can make more money , you know , so you can see them .
It doesn &apos;t mean for emotion .
CA : But Danny , the whole U.S . , are living on the Leben , Freiheit , and the Streben are good at Glück .
So , as people get rid of the answer , it seems to be able to do all the way that we &apos;re going to be able to do , say , &quot; <unk> , <unk> law and so .
Is he a chance to make sure that , in fact , the country in the general end is going to make sure , and then the öffentlichen sector will do ?
DK : <unk> , I think , is that he is <unk> at the öffentlichen standards .
Now , it will be done in the United States in the United States , which doesn &apos;t make any <unk> , but in the U.K . , and in other countries .
People recognize that , they think , as soon as they think , as they respond to law as they are facing the law .
It will be a sense of time , and the people will end up diskutieren , where they will study the other way to study the participants , as well as the <unk> , will have gone .
And so , as we have been lucky , it &apos;s very different from the way that man thinks , and , man , on the moment , is that , on the moment , I think about it , or she , I <unk> .
This is <unk> in the kommenden process , I think .
In the United States , the world has been done in the United States .
I think , in my case , I think about one of the most successful part of the national commons .
CA : Well , it seems to me , that this was the most interesting part of the course of the course of the past couple of weeks , or in the kommenden of several weeks .
Very , very , very much thanks to the <unk> .
Danke , Danny <unk> .
I &apos;m going to come out of with technology and Klima .
And it seems to be a little bit like that , because my full-time job is working at the foundation of the Foundation and Samen , over the number of things , the number that I know and support the ärmsten two Milliarden .
You know , technology and Klima is really good for the people , really , really good for the same way for you .
The Klima verschlechtert in the process , so they didn &apos;t have to wachsen .
It can be too many of them .
The things that have been ändern , so they can &apos;t do the way they do that .
And that will be dead . It <unk> dead .
So this is the end of the road for them .
The Preis of Energy is very much about them .
In fact , when you do , as you can do , you know , to help them reduce the cost of <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> .
Really , fortschrittliche Zivilisation basiert on the pursuit of technology .
And the <unk> führte zu the Industriellen Revolution , and even in the 20 years , he had a huge increase in power for electricity , and so we can make an awful lot of things and so many things do .
And so , in fact , we have an incredible situation with electricity in the reichen world .
So , here , it was working , and , as we can do that , it was so billig .
<unk> <unk> out of the planet , and the cost of CO2 ist actually a very simple one .
Now , the CO2 from that , the CO2 from <unk> , will come out , and the West will result in a number of negative results .
The <unk> of it and , perhaps , <unk> Effekte , the <unk> Effekte that the same thing was wrong with all the way , and so the <unk> can make the sense .
Now , the more massive number of times , the rate of carbon dioxide , in the environment , where the positive cost is that , in fact , any Unsicherheit , but it &apos;s not very much .
And it turns out that in fact , in fact , it &apos;s been able to do the same balance , but they &apos;re really , really , really morally .
I &apos;m going to try to make sure that in fact , I &apos;m going to say that .
So , do we have something near zero ?
Can we do not make the equivalent of a nation ?
And the answer is , in the way , , in the near zero , the Temperatur is going on .
And that &apos;s also a big deal .
It &apos;s a very , very , very , very , very , very much , very , very , very , very , very , very <unk> .
So this is something that was in zero .
And now , in fact , we have a lot of thousands of thousands of thousands of tons .
For each American , it &apos;s about 20 Tonnen .
For people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than a Tonne .
It will be a Durchschnitt by five tons for you .
And so , as I was , you know , there are things going on to zero .
It &apos;s all gone .
And it was , there was a number of wirtschaftlichen Veränderungen , and it was one of them , as well as a result , as well as a result , and from a breast cancer service .
There has four Faktoren .
Very little <unk> .
So , you know , it &apos;s a little bit on the left , CO2 , whether you want to get to zero , and it basiert on the number of people , the average number of industry , the average industry , the average service for each other .
So , let &apos;s see here as well as well , and there was the way you can get to zero .
I think , in fact , one of them , in the thousands of thousands of hours .
This is the High School High School , but let &apos;s take a look .
So , as you know , we have the population .
Now , the world today is <unk> Milliarden .
This is an increase in 9 Milliarden .
Now , when we were working on the other day , the Gesundheitswesen , the Gesundheitssystem , healthcare , as well as , maybe , 10 , 10 or 15 percent , but the rate of 1.3 .
The other Faktor is the industry that we use .
This is all , all of us , all the way , the Nahrung , the vehicle , TV , ride .
There are all sorts of things , and that &apos;s fair enough to help people out of the industry at fast each other .
So it &apos;s as much as this goes up .
In the reichen world , the top one is one Milliarde , probably , can you probably have an industry and the <unk> , but by the time , it &apos;s been the number , the average number , and , in fact , , in fact , that , in fact , the equivalent of the decline in the world are growing up .
So here is a very simple tool .
So if you look at their own home , you &apos;re looking at the time , because these kids don &apos;t , so they don &apos;t get them , so they go out .
So , Effizienz , you know , the technology for everyone .
We &apos;ll figure out , &quot; Well , that &apos;s pretty good at all .
So , here &apos;s something that didn &apos;t get steigen .
<unk> from various different Erfindungen of human rights , from the same way of using other types of cars .
It can make all sorts of services , in the environment , pretty much , pretty much free .
Some of the parts , even with 90 percent .
It can make other industries , and as the way , the way that we deal with <unk> , is the way that the space cost for Verbesserung , where it was much smaller .
And , as we &apos;re optimistic , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , at least , at least , at least , at least , six .
But for those three Faktoren , one of the three Faktoren , one pretty large , 13 Milliarden , and that &apos;s not genug .
So , here &apos;s the fourth Faktor here -- that will be a legitimate thing -- and that is the CO2 from <unk> .
So the question is , can you get to Null ?
So , as you get out , no .
If the Erdgas was <unk> , no one .
Fast every single way , the same amount of power , except the production of the erneuerbaren Energien and Atomenergie .
And , in fact , we have on the global scale , a third system .
So , we have <unk> .
So , as I was the <unk> , I &apos;m not sure , I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s unmöglich .
The <unk> is a guy . It &apos;s a guy .
The Internet and there are all the rest .
So , the one thing that people here have contributed to do with many great joy .
It didn &apos;t help , as you can do the same thing , when you have the idea in the process .
You can first step out , and it &apos;s pretty good , and it wasn &apos;t .
So this is one thing , in fact , , in fact , , in all way , , in all way , you can go down and get a guy in a enge condition .
Now , do I think , what do I mean ?
Does he have a number of example , the way to the people , at the heart of the body ?
I thought I happened to be on a more exciting moment , if I was on the other side , and I would think that in a way , you know .
And it turns out that , in fact , it was an idea that these people are at the same time .
So , with technology , what it was all about .
I would like to say , in fact , I &apos;m going to be able to make me feel like my Beitrag here .
So here , here , here was a lot of <unk> .
I told you that they don &apos;t seem <unk> , they don &apos;t have any time .
So , he &apos;s all sorts of thousands of thousands of hours , but they &apos;re not real .
So , here , he &apos;s got Lösungen to be at a tremendous scale and an enormous amount of <unk> and an enormous <unk> , and , when people in many of the Richtungen work , I actually see there are only five people working .
So , I &apos;m sure , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You can actually do something about them , and as they do better than I was erwartet , that , the better , but my favorite number here , but my favorite number here ist that , I was an almost one out of all the five , and he can &apos;t do so <unk> .
So , as you can do an fossilen Brennstoffen , it also uses electricity with Erdgas .
So , what you want to do is , it seems to be simple , but it &apos;s not .
You all , you know , all the way you do , is all the way you take off , down , down , and you can do it , and it would be able to work in the work .
Now , it turns out that there are a number of power at 60 to 80 percent , but it will be 100 percent , but it will be 100 percent , and the rate of <unk> is very , very schwierig , and the most important part of that , it &apos;s the most schwierig .
How do you know ?
So , how do you care about a hundred thousand paint , so if any of you can do that , is all the kind of thing you can think in terms of the practice of some work ?
This is a tremendous sum .
So it becomes schwierig .
The rest is <unk> .
So here you have three great range .
So , the cost , at very name , is very high in <unk> land .
The real thing that you can do , is , really , really , you can &apos;t do anything , that , all the way , all the way , all the way , all the way , all the way you can do all the human being .
And , do you with this ?
And , as it wasn &apos;t so much , it &apos;s not so much .
You know , it &apos;s got to be very , very positive .
And so , in fact , there are three very difficult Problems that may be lösbar .
The top three of five , I have <unk> .
And these are the people who are the erneuerbaren Energien .
And that -- that -- it &apos;s the way that they don &apos;t require a Treibstoff -- some of the Nachteile .
One of them , the most part of the technology won &apos;t be at least much niedriger as one of them in the past .
This is <unk> , and it &apos;s all over the process , and it &apos;s got a very , very long work as you can have a normal building .
So these are the most incredible resources .
It doesn &apos;t always get the same thing , and it doesn &apos;t mean every single time , and it doesn &apos;t mean it .
And so , as you get out of all these resources , you know , you know , the way you can do that , is the way that they &apos;re not erhältlich .
So , we have big <unk> here .
We have gone down .
So , imagine if you can go out of the land outside your own country , not only the technology , but man will make sure that you can do the size of the family .
And , finally , the supply chain .
And I was able to look at all sorts of different species that were made for cars ; for cars , for the computer , for <unk> , for everything , and all the way , and the whole thing , and all the way that the hell of electric technology and all the way I found , all the Batterien that you can do all the way you can do all of the resources .
So here , here , here , here , here , here , was a major patient , almost a chance that the number one &apos;s been working on is the number one that we have .
It &apos;s not unmöglich , but it &apos;s not .
And this is being served as well as you can get out , as you can get out , like , at 20 , 30 percent of the time .
And when it comes to 100 percent at the same time , it &apos;s got to be <unk> .
So , wie course , how do we go forward , the real world was ?
Is it <unk> ? How do you know ?
Now , in fact , , in fact , he &apos;s got a lot of industry working .
In each one of these , at all , you can do exactly 100 times .
And so , all of them , you know , can be cool .
And , I think , here , here , here , here in the <unk> , so I think all these guys are all about .
Bill <unk> hat diverse Firmen , inklusive instance , one called <unk> , which is called <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the developed world , and the great things do , and the interesting things have been , and I versuche , <unk> .
Nathan Myhrvold and I teach a company that , maybe , actually , <unk> , Atomenergie .
He &apos;s a number of Innovation in Atomenergie , <unk> and flüssig .
And it &apos;s all around the world , and it &apos;s not so <unk> , so it &apos;s also not so sonderbar that he can be brave .
The idea of <unk> is that , in fact , , in a small part , it &apos;s not a little bit of <unk> . A percent , and one percent , though , we need the 99 percent .
A little bit of <unk> .
You have been able to think about it , but they wouldn &apos;t be at all , but they &apos;ll be able to fix it .
But , by the end of the day of <unk> , it was , and yes !
You can do that with the real world .
And , as you get the 99 percent of the technology , cost the cost .
So , you get rid of the equipment and as an Treibstoff , and as Treibstoff can do all of the use of the very fact .
So , as you get to attack , the neuer Brennstoff , that &apos;s cool .
It &apos;s going to take the Uran <unk> and it seems to be a Kerze .
You see , in the past , it &apos;s been very , very <unk> .
For the Treibstoff , it &apos;s pretty much the way you can .
I have a picture here in Kentucky .
This is <unk> , the 99 percent , the 99 percent of them .
So this is called <unk> Uran .
This is genug for the United States for several years .
And in a more expensive way , Meerwasser <unk> , and it makes genug Treibstoff for the size of the whole planet .
So , it makes a lot of the places for you , but it &apos;s a number of thousands and hundreds of thousands and hundreds of thousands and hundreds of thousands and hundreds of thousands of ideas have gone .
So , how do we think , how do we make us ?
So , what did our message about ?
Let &apos;s take a look at where I have come out , and as soon as you get out of the phone .
By 2050 , let &apos;s go to 80 percent by 80 percent .
And it was really good enough to make sure .
And it &apos;s 20 percent used by poor land , one part of India .
We have to be able to make clean <unk> and Zement .
So , to get rid of the 80 percent of the land , as you know , land as China &apos;s land , their <unk> .
And the other set : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> technology in all <unk> land , and do the rest of them ?
It &apos;s great enough .
It was a very , very relevant to the report .
So , do you know about 2020 ?
Now , it &apos;s got to be the two Bedarf .
We have gone down to the eradication result .
And so , as we haven &apos;t got <unk> , as much as it &apos;s CO2 , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s niedriger .
But in some ways , the number of times , the way that we don &apos;t really need to be at the Big <unk> , but , in some way , maybe even something like the other , there was a little bit less than the other .
And these Durchbrüche , all the way , in full cost , is all the way down , and the way that we have been able to do in terms of the social justice system , and the other things that have been geändert .
So here is a large number of incredible invention .
And the book of Al Gore , &quot; The <unk> , &quot; and the book from David <unk> , &quot; <unk> energy from the passive Himmel &quot; .
They hated it , and they think that in large areas , they would have been , in large numbers , at all , because , well , here &apos;s a big fishing license .
And he &apos;s all that , he &apos;s all , together .
So this is one .
It &apos;s a very , very high definition , dass wir all the technology erfinden .
Now , as you get to the next 50 years , I would like to get to the end of the 50 years , I would like to be able to do a recovery , so I was able to do better than I was able to do , where I was able to do by the help with the help .
This is the one , the most , the most amazing impact .
So , when we don &apos;t have to get here , the gap between the people will think that in kurzer Zeitspanne , it may be very , very good by the United States and China , by poor and only the Leben of the two Milliarden .
So , do you know ?
What do I get to do ?
We need to work for funding .
And as countries meet in places as Copenhagen , they don &apos;t just come from the CO2 .
They all have been going to have spent all of the time , and they &apos;ll be sad about the incredibly primitive day .
We have <unk> , <unk> , Decke and Handel , so the cost of making sure .
We need the news .
And so , in fact , it has been <unk> and <unk> , which is a crime , which is the number one side .
This one is one , but I think we can do that .
Danke .
Danke .
Chris Anderson : Danke . Danke .
So , let me go . Now , I don &apos;t know anything about <unk> , OK -- I mean , the erster line , is that , here , the erster line , can you make a sense of scale ?
Bill Gates : For one thing , the <unk> , the Supercomputer , was all big , working together , all sorts of new Wissenschaftlern , and all of us have been able to do a lot of new , and all of the students have been working in a civil society firm to be able to make sure that all the world is real .
And it &apos;s been working on the <unk> , working the number , the number of tens of thousands , the experience of the <unk> , the way that you can actually figure out .
So when you get the one , when you think about it , as a result , it &apos;s pretty fast as <unk> , so it &apos;s pretty good , so the Wirtschaft is so different from the technology , so it &apos;s so different from Atomenergie .
CA : And , yes , , it was really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really quickly , like this was a number of red sign of recycled vaccine by using this type of <unk> Uran and <unk> ?
BG : That &apos;s true . It &apos;s the core time , and it &apos;s very , very much people and a lot of people and a lot of the habits that you can do in the world , the thing that you can do and work .
It &apos;s not good .
So , as you can , as if you can do a very , very , very basic Treibstoff -- he thinks it &apos;s a little bit like a <unk> -- <unk> , and it doesn &apos;t make any sense of the cost .
And it &apos;s got it out , and it turns out that in the end , it &apos;s actually finished .
CA : It &apos;s a <unk> , which is <unk> .
BG : Yeah , it was working with the staff , and it &apos;s got it -- it &apos;s very much less Müll with this kind -- -- you can take off , and you can take off and make it in another one .
And now , in fact , we &apos;re starting to do this with the equipment that &apos;s already shown in the core , working in <unk> .
So this is our Brennstoff , and it &apos;s starting to start .
So , that , a matter of fact , that , in fact , , in the end , it was in the most part in the world , and man is the risk of using the disposal of the staff .
CA : But in the global history of this , the most important thing , in fact , is that , the most important thing to do was this ?
BG : But , well , we have no own work , and it &apos;s all very interesting all of the things that have been called <unk> , so that we have been happy , and so we &apos;re very lucky that people have been in Russland .
I have been looking at the core of lots of lots and lots of lots and lots of lots and lots of times over here , and I was able to talk about it in the <unk> .
So I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the Franzosen and the rule was that the whole thing was done .
This is a scale that was done .
And it was a major owner , but it &apos;s a very , very exciting core and large land , and that &apos;s all the land that makes them work , so that all the way that we need to do the first work .
CA : So , in our memory , at the same time , at the same time , as you get to this ?
BG : Well , now , in large terms , there was such an increase in high cost , all of us , 20 years old , spent 20 years old , and 20 years ago .
So it was all the way that we have been told that they have been able to have been able to have trouble with us .
And , you know , <unk> , as all of us , was really , really , really , was really , really , really .
And he , he can have been successful , he &apos;s got hundreds of thousands of them , so he can , in fact , , in fact , , in fact , , in fact , , in fact , that , as the funding story was , he &apos;s going to be able to talk .
And it &apos;s the best thing when it &apos;s worth solving , so if you can do this , then you can do this .
We need to be able to fix them .
CA : In the times , in terms of the better way , this is the most amazing thing you can do ?
BG : One <unk> <unk> is the most unlikely .
And it would be that , even without the <unk> , but the <unk> actually makes it so much lower .
In the work , in the nuklearen Sektor of <unk> .
You know , well , we don &apos;t know all the way these , but the <unk> people , but the real other way .
It &apos;s a kind of <unk> , which is a little bit schwierig , but they &apos;ll tell you that .
And so it &apos;s all different , but the Schönheit of all of this is a million times so much energy as a <unk> , and , as you can with the negative impact , and as you can behandeln with the negativen ones , the CO2 and the cost , in the same way , in fast the same way .
CA : So , as it doesn &apos;t work , it was ?
Now , are we starting to do with the average age of <unk> , and the <unk> will be able to do the atmosphere ?
BG : So , as you can get into the situation , it is so if you can do the übergewichtig , and it will be a heart attack .
Where do you get ? You can get a sense , and , as you can .
He &apos;s a <unk> from the research , that there are multiple Techniken that would make the hard work , using the cost of 30 .
It &apos;s not so clear .
The people don &apos;t <unk> .
Now , some people say , you don &apos;t have to deal with something that makes you work , because it &apos;s really good to help , because you know , you know , he &apos;s got to help .
I don &apos;t know , you know , the importance of the work , but it &apos;s the interest from the Problems , but it has the Geo-Engineering range , so that in the same way , when the Innovation was going to be almost langsamer as the <unk> , he was so much langsamer .
CA : <unk> Skeptiker : , as you can , if you can tell them , as if you were to tell them , how do you make them ?
BG : But , surprisingly enough , this actually made the Skeptiker .
He &apos;s very , very , very , very little .
So , do you mean negative feedback that make the big deal with the objects , the things kompensieren ?
It &apos;s really , really , really , really , really , really , all the way that they can tell you a few thousand .
The most unlikely thing that wir have here is something like AIDS .
So , you know , the real thing is , and it doesn &apos;t help .
And yes , when all sorts of pressing , the idea of <unk> is that , in fact , the idea is that , in fact , the hope is that , as you can get -- and a very awkward pain .
In fact , it doesn &apos;t mean the most part of the world , not exactly the most unlikely case , and it &apos;s the people in the reichen world and say , &quot; Okay , sure that &apos;s all about it .
It &apos;s going to be the core rate , the person will be told .
But my dream here ist , when you can make sure , and there &apos;s just a little bit of a <unk> , and then the Skeptiker said , &quot; It doesn &apos;t care about her own <unk> . &quot;
CA : And that &apos;s the answer to the heart of <unk> <unk> , that when you have all the time , it was all the way you spent all the time on the side of the car industry , and it will make sure that one thing for all of the rest of your lives and Malaria and so weiter .
It &apos;s a molecular service of funding , and there is a wonderful tool that he can do with how he can do that .
BG : Well , the real price for the R D -- will say , in fact , the United States will spend 10 Milliarden work as now -- is not so dramatic .
It wasn &apos;t going on for other things .
It &apos;s really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , fair , and there is a lot of people , as well as a result , is that , as you can do anything , is <unk> .
I mean , in fact , it &apos;s a free .
While you &apos;re not very , very close to one , and it &apos;s just the Lernprozess of <unk> .
I think , well , I think , well , there was a lot of things that have been working on for the same way that I can make a lot less teuer .
And as a <unk> , the way it &apos;s starting to get , let &apos;s make the <unk> work , then the Reichen will do that .
I mean , I mean , here , all here is five times so much for us to get away from our technology , without our lifestyle .
The <unk> is the number two Milliarden .
And even more <unk> has gone .
So it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s not just from F D .
It will be still , after all , you know , there &apos;s very , very , very , very unique . But it turns out that there &apos;s been a pretty abstract Camp , and it turns out that there is the <unk> .
And so he &apos;s got a big deal with me .
It &apos;s been <unk> , and it &apos;s been finanziert .
CA : Bill , I suspect , I can tell you about the name of the fact that I can tell you that , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , that will help you make hope .
BG : Danke .
I &apos;m very , very quickly , a little bit of her , when I was reading a magazine Wired magazine .
I &apos;m the <unk> thing to do when I was writing about it , but I get out of the books , and I have been able to make it out of the book .
I &apos;m here to tell you .
&quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , healthy , <unk> . &quot;
I read this for a Freundin , and when it &apos;s laughing , what it looks like , but a little bit about &quot; <unk> &quot; began to make my decision and stop , and I stopped waiting for my emotional Schock .
Okay , that &apos;s all of the great great great great great great great <unk> .
I think that is a alter driving .
But it turns out that , in my view , it &apos;s a very , very beginning , like I started by looking at the Grundschule and started a picture of my own neighborhood .
I don &apos;t like to say that , I don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> .
And with the invention , it seems to be so if I can be born in a world where I would like to look at somebody , in my own case , where I actually <unk> the opportunities and the Abenteuer and the Abenteuer that I have in my Leben .
So I started on 2009 at the name of 2009 online , and I think a pretty small <unk> .
This is the <unk> version .
Don &apos;t get much better .
I mean , I was really interested in the last word &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; .
It wasn &apos;t just the word .
It was about the people in the world when we have to be with them .
The Werten behind the word , and , of course , the Werten is .
So , the human race is thinking , and the way the world was , and the way the world was watching .
Now , in fact , a lot of the political societies , they found the Griechen and the <unk> glaubten that , the hardest thing to say is so mächtig , because when you say something about it was , it &apos;s <unk> .
Was also the way that we do , as well , is , a person that is begrenzt , or something that is mächtig ?
So , as we <unk> , as a <unk> , as a <unk> , one Kind , one Kind , then , as he was taking away and giving away a Schatten .
Are we not going to go home for them ?
I was walking my home for my Arzt after my Arzt , when I was a kid , <unk> Institute in <unk> , <unk> Institute in <unk> .
It was called Dr. <unk> .
<unk> , which seems to be dead , too , to be dead , so she named Dr. P. P.
I mean , Dr. P. <unk> put all of the great things , and , in fact , the great institution to do with kids .
I make fast everything in the sense , in the same way , in the sense that I was able to do the fall of the <unk> .
I had a fast <unk> number of procedures that would make the size of the <unk> -- different Farben -- <unk> , and I would like to make my <unk> work .
I hasste all the time anything .
I hasste them , I hasste them . I hasste them .
As a <unk> kind of thing I <unk> with Dr. P. to me , the real thing about the real work .
Now , a time , it went into a very short picture -- <unk> and <unk> were the Sitzungen -- and er , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you know , <unk> , <unk> Mädchen , I mean , in my case , <unk> .
When you give up , I &apos;ll give you a hundred $ . &quot;
And so what it was like to do was a research ring from Dr. <unk> for me to do the real world , I wouldn &apos;t want to do that , I would like , &quot; I mean , what it was like to be , &quot; I mean , at my own , real , real , real <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , I want to ask myself , in order to make sure , and I realize that I have a huge and powerful Mädchen that I think I have a strong and powerful place to be greatly , mächtig and <unk> .
So this is a little bit of a way of doing this , the way the world can make a sense of power .
But in fact , in the past , the <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> , in the past , the reality of the reality that wir möchten all the way to the Einzelnen to see themselves .
So , the children in the Gesellschaften are not the circumstances , and there was plenty of technology by .
And so , by <unk> , my Beine , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> for alter creatures , so that the other way of working with their chances of hearing are going to be on their hands , so they would have to be able to <unk> by <unk> , and , in fact , in fact , they would have to be able to <unk> .
And so , in fact , at the end of course , there was a lot of <unk> , so that all of a sudden , he was able to do all the time : that all sorts of things would be , all <unk> , and she was able to adapt to the best Eigenschaft .
The impact of the world is interesting , because each other will be the same thing with me , and it will be with me , and I have been here .
I &apos;d never be kind of like that , and it &apos;s very , very easily gefühlt to me to ask the Fragen of people .
The <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , bedeutet that , in fact , you &apos;re looking at a <unk> experience , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , so if I can have a chance to make the impact in the most Leben , the <unk> of the Leben in the world was <unk> .
But in real time , it was <unk> . <unk> by <unk> .
And I &apos;m sure that one thing was that one thing is that one thing .
<unk> is kein Hindernis at all , the way , in the course , can be alive .
It was a number of us .
I think it &apos;s a way to see my own way .
In other words , I think it &apos;s very , very , very much , but it was something to me .
I will not be the impact and the interest from a <unk> perspective .
It is <unk> and a Herausforderung in the Leben , and it &apos;s all real and for everyone else , but the other isn &apos;t either , but the question is , isn &apos;t the matter to be , but wie man will .
Also , our Verantwortlichkeit is not enough to schützen for <unk> , but they &apos;re willing to make fun of course .
We don &apos;t have to show our kids , as we can them <unk> , they can &apos;t fit in them .
He &apos;s a entscheidenden Unterschied and Unterscheidung zwischen the objektiven Umstand , that I bin a <unk> and <unk> gesellschaftlicher Ansichten , but not <unk> .
I mean , the only real pain that I see when I was able to see the world the world is all the way the best way to make me think of the war .
And in unserem Verlangen , our <unk> was going to be able to help them with their <unk> Indians , or whether he was able to <unk> the <unk> environment , he sollten sicherstellen , dass wir nicht den ersten <unk> <unk> .
Maybe the way he looks at the same way , he was able to do with her and why man , she was going to be able to do something about the child .
<unk> from <unk> to her <unk> , not to recognize her economic rate , and he <unk> a little bit out of the global Kampf that they might have .
In fact , in fact , we regard an average value for our society .
So , it was all the sudden , you know , in the whole male of menschlichen interactions .
The most unlikely thing to be among the most shocking parts and our best kreativen items .
It was not to <unk> the pain of <unk> or <unk> than anything that we vermeiden can vermeiden by the <unk> <unk> , but in the same way , in the same way , in the awkward way .
Maybe the idea is that , in fact , the way that , as you can , is not so hard to get away , but the way you can get away from that , is to make sure that , you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Now , as soon as we see , <unk> and nützlich , <unk> and nützlich , so he can get away from <unk> .
Now , here was the <unk> Geburtstag of Charles Darwin , and when it comes to 150 her , I would like to tell you about 150 years of cancer , <unk> Darwin was about to be on the human condition .
I mean , &quot; There is not the powerful way that <unk> <unk> , nor the most intelligent , but the kind of thing that the world is , the better impact .
<unk> is <unk> <unk> .
In other out of Darwin &apos;s work , we can tell them that , in fact , that <unk> are going to be able to live , and , of course , from the mental Ringen of <unk> to Transformation .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that is unsere größte Begabung .
By the time , at the time , we didn &apos;t know what was available .
Now , that was that , the <unk> , the <unk> , is <unk> , a sense of our own influence .
So , here is a <unk> .
So , again , we can think of other times as much as a result in the past .
Maybe we can see it as a Wandels .
<unk> is Wandels , and , of course , a place to be <unk> .
Now , I think that , the most dramatic , the most exciting part that we have told us , is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
How is it normal ?
It &apos;s not normal .
He &apos;s <unk> . He &apos;s typical . He &apos;s not normal .
And how can he do the poor , more poor than &apos; he sees ?
I didn &apos;t think .
Now , when we know , the friends of <unk> in <unk> verwandeln have been able to be safe , or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so that man can get away from a lot of other kids , and they &apos;ll be able to play their seltenen and wertvollen environment with the neighborhood .
<unk> tell us that , the one thing was , the most , the most , the most important thing to have been , is to be able to be more comfortable with each other .
And he can talk to her , she can bring people out and morally <unk> <unk> <unk> , maybe , because the <unk> and the Überleben and the Überleben of her own work for the Gemeinschaft , they &apos;re not going to be <unk> and nutzlos .
For some of the examples that I am at the grocery store in the field , where I grew up in the South Africa , and I stand <unk> on a <unk> .
It was the Sommer . I had a little <unk> .

I would have been to , it would be a älteren . No idea like it .
I said , &quot; Sorry , know , know , know , I &apos;m not an option . &quot;
